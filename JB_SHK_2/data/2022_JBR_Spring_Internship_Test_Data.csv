35103873,"It has been a challenge for solving the motor imagery classification problem in the brain informatics area. Accuracy and efficiency are the major obstacles for motor imagery analysis in the past decades since the computational capability and algorithmic availability cannot satisfy complex brain signal analysis. In recent years, the rapid development of machine learning (ML) methods has empowered people to tackle the motor imagery classification problem with more efficient methods. Among various ML methods, the Graph neural networks (GNNs) method has shown its efficiency and accuracy in dealing with inter-related complex networks. The use of GNN provides new possibilities for feature extraction from brain structure connection. In this paper, we proposed a new model called MCGNet<sup>+</sup>, which improves the performance of our previous model MutualGraphNet. In this latest model, the mutual information of the input columns forms the initial adjacency matrix for the cosine similarity calculation between columns to generate a new adjacency matrix in each iteration. The dynamic adjacency matrix combined with the spatial temporal graph convolution network (ST-GCN) has better performance than the unchanged matrix model. The experimental results indicate that MCGNet<sup>+</sup> is robust enough to learn the interpretable features and outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods."
35095410,"The development of reliable assistive devices for patients that suffer from motor impairments following central nervous system lesions remains a major challenge in the field of non-invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). These approaches are predominated by electroencephalography and rely on advanced signal processing and machine learning methods to extract neural correlates of motor activity. However, despite tremendous and still ongoing efforts, their value as effective clinical tools remains limited. We advocate that a rather overlooked research avenue lies in efforts to question neurophysiological markers traditionally targeted in non-invasive motor BCIs. We propose an alternative approach grounded by recent fundamental advances in non-invasive neurophysiology, specifically subject-specific feature extraction of sensorimotor bursts of activity recorded <i>via</i> (possibly magnetoencephalography-optimized) electroencephalography. This path holds promise in overcoming a significant proportion of existing limitations, and could foster the wider adoption of online BCIs in rehabilitation protocols."
35093844,"Identifying motor and mental imagery electroencephalography (EEG) signals is imperative to realizing automated, robust brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. In the present study, we proposed a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN)-based new automated framework feasible for robust BCI systems with small and ample samples of motor and mental imagery EEG training data. The framework is explored by investigating the implications of different limiting factors, such as learning rates and optimizers, processed versus unprocessed scalograms, and features derived from untuned pretrained models in small, medium, and large pretrained CNN models. The experiments were performed on three public datasets obtained from BCI Competition III. The datasets were denoised with multiscale principal component analysis, and time-frequency scalograms were obtained by employing a continuous wavelet transform. The scalograms were fed into several variants of ten pretrained models for feature extraction and identification of different EEG tasks. The experimental results showed that ShuffleNet yielded the maximum average classification accuracy of 99.52% using an RMSProp optimizer with a learning rate of 0.000 1. It was observed that low learning rates converge to more optimal performances compared to high learning rates. Moreover, noisy scalograms and features extracted from untuned networks resulted in slightly lower performance than denoised scalograms and tuned networks, respectively. The overall results suggest that pretrained models are robust when identifying EEG signals because of their ability to preserve the time-frequency structure of EEG signals and promising classification outcomes."
35090904,"Brain computer interface (BCI) utilizes brain signals to help users interact with external devices directly. EEG is one of the most commonly used techniques for brain signal acquisition in BCI. However, it is notoriously difficult to build a generic EEG recognition model due to significant non-stationarity and subject-to-subject variations, and the requirement for long time training. Transfer learning (TL) is particularly useful because it can alleviate the calibration requirement in EEG-based BCI applications by transferring the calibration information from existing subjects to new subject. To take advantage of geometric properties in Riemann manifold and joint distribution adaptation, a manifold embedded transfer learning (METL) framework was proposed for motor imagery (MI) EEG decoding. First, the covariance matrices of the EEG trials are first aligned on the SPD manifold. Then the features are extracted from both the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold and Grassmann manifold. Finally, the classification model is learned by combining the structural risk minimization (SRM) of source domain and joint distribution alignment of source and target domains. Experimental results on two MI EEG datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed METL. In particular, when there are a small amount of labeled samples in the target domain, METL demonstrated a more accurate and stable classification performance than conventional methods. Compared with several state-of-the-art methods, METL has achieved better classification accuracy, 71.81% and 69.06% in single-to-single (STS), 83.14% and 76.00% in multi-to-single (MTS) transfer tasks, respectively. METL can cope with single source domain or multi-source domains and compared with single-source transfer learning, multi-source transfer learning can improve the performance effectively due to the data expansion. It is effective enough to achieve superior performance for classification of EEG signals."
35088740,"Brain-computer interface (BCI)-controlled functional electrical stimulation (FES) has been used in rehabilitation for improving hand motor function. However, mechanisms of improvements are still not well understood. The objective of this study was to investigate how BCI-controlled FES affects hand muscle corticospinal excitability. A total of 12 healthy young adults were recruited in the study. During BCI calibration, a single electroencephalography channel from the motor cortex and a frequency band were chosen to detect event-related desynchronization (ERD) of cortical oscillatory activity during kinesthetic wrist motor imagery (MI). The MI-based BCI system was used to detect active states on the basis of ERD activity in real time and produce contralateral wrist extension movements through FES of the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) muscle. As a control condition, FES was used to generate wrist extension at random intervals. The two interventions were performed on separate days and lasted 25 minutes. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in ECR (intervention target) and flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscles were elicited through single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex to compare corticospinal excitability before (pre), immediately after (post0), and 30 minutes after (post30) the interventions. After the BCI-FES intervention, ECR muscle MEPs were significantly facilitated at post0 and post30 time points compared with before the intervention (pre), whereas there were no changes in the FCR muscle corticospinal excitability. Conversely, after the random FES intervention, both ECR and FCR muscle MEPs were unaffected compared with before the intervention (pre). Our results demonstrated evidence that BCI-FES intervention could elicit muscle-specific short-term corticospinal excitability facilitation of the intervention targeted (ECR) muscle only, whereas randomly applied FES was ineffective in eliciting any changes. Notably, these findings suggest that associative cortical and peripheral activations during BCI-FES can effectively elicit targeted muscle corticospinal excitability facilitation, implying possible rehabilitation mechanisms."
35085095,"Optimal feature extraction for multi-category motor imagery brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) is a research hotspot. The common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is one of the most widely used methods in MI-BCIs. However, its performance is adversely affected by variance in the operational frequency band and noise interference. Furthermore, the performance of CSP is not satisfactory when addressing multi-category classification problems. In this work, we propose a fusion method combining Filter Banks and Riemannian Tangent Space (FBRTS) in multiple time windows. FBRTS uses multiple filter banks to overcome the problem of variance in the operational frequency band. It also applies the Riemannian method to the covariance matrix extracted by the spatial filter to obtain more robust features in order to overcome the problem of noise interference. In addition, we use a One-Versus-Rest support vector machine (OVR-SVM) model to classify multi-category features. We evaluate our FBRTS method using BCI competition IV dataset 2a and 2b. The experimental results show that the average classification accuracy of our FBRTS method is 77.7% and 86.9% in datasets 2a and 2b respectively. By analyzing the influence of the different numbers of filter banks and time windows on the performance of our FBRTS method, we can identify the optimal number of filter banks and time windows. Additionally, our FBRTS method can obtain more distinctive features than the filter banks common spatial pattern (FBCSP) method in two-dimensional embedding space. These results show that our proposed method can improve the performance of MI-BCIs."
35069721,"Recently, the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal presents an excellent potential for a new person identification technique. Several studies defined the EEG with unique features, universality, and natural robustness to be used as a new track to prevent spoofing attacks. The EEG signals are a visual recording of the brain's electrical activities, measured by placing electrodes (channels) in various scalp positions. However, traditional EEG-based systems lead to high complexity with many channels, and some channels have critical information for the identification system while others do not. Several studies have proposed a single objective to address the EEG channel for person identification. Unfortunately, these studies only focused on increasing the accuracy rate without balancing the accuracy and the total number of selected EEG channels. The novelty of this paper is to propose a multiobjective binary version of the cuckoo search algorithm (MOBCS-KNN) to find optimal EEG channel selections for person identification. The proposed method (MOBCS-KNN) used a weighted sum technique to implement a multiobjective approach. In addition, a KNN classifier for EEG-based biometric person identification is used. It is worth mentioning that this is the initial investigation of using a multiobjective technique with EEG channel selection problem. A standard EEG motor imagery dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the MOBCS-KNN. The experiments show that the MOBCS-KNN obtained accuracy of 93.86% using only 24 sensors with AR20 autoregressive coefficients. Another critical point is that the MOBCS-KNN finds channels not too close to each other to capture relevant information from all over the head. In conclusion, the MOBCS-KNN algorithm achieves the best results compared with metaheuristic algorithms. Finally, the recommended approach can draw future directions to be applied to different research areas."
35053801,"The ability to control external devices through thought is increasingly becoming a reality. Human beings can use the electrical signals of their brain to interact or change the surrounding environment and more. The development of this technology called brain-computer interface (BCI) will increasingly allow people with motor disabilities to communicate or use assistive devices to walk, manipulate objects and communicate. Using data from the PhysioNet database, this study implemented a pattern classification system for use in a BCI on 109 healthy volunteers during real movement activities and motor imagery recorded by 64-channels electroencephalography (EEG) system. Different classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees (TREE) were applied on different combinations of EEG channels. Starting from two channels (C3, C4 and CP3 and CP4) positioned on the contralateral and ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex, the Region of Interest (RoI) centred on C3/Cp3 and C4/Cp4 and, finally, a data-driven automatic channels selection was tested to explore the best channel combination able to increase the classification accuracy. The results showed that the proposed automatic channels selection was able to significantly improve the performance of each classifier achieving 98% of accuracy for classification of real and imagined hand movement (sensitivity = 97%, specificity = 99%, AUC = 0.99) by SVM. While the accuracy of the classification between the imagery of hand and foot movements was 91% (sensitivity = 87%, specificity = 86%, AUC = 0.93) also with SVM. In the proposed approach, the data-driven automatic channels selection outperforms classical a priori channel selection models such as C3/C4, Cp3/Cp4, or RoIs around those channels with the utmost accuracy to help remove the boundaries of human communication and improve the quality of life of people with disabilities."
35049650,"Automatic high-level feature extraction has become a possibility with the advancement of deep learning, and it has been used to optimize efficiency. Recently, classification methods for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based electroencephalography (EEG) motor imagery have been proposed, and have achieved reasonably high classification accuracy. These approaches, however, use the CNN single convolution scale, whereas the best convolution scale varies from subject to subject. This limits the precision of classification. This paper proposes multibranch CNN models to address this issue by effectively extracting the spatial and temporal features from raw EEG data, where the branches correspond to different filter kernel sizes. The proposed method's promising performance is demonstrated by experimental results on two public datasets, the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset and the High Gamma Dataset (HGD). The results of the technique show a 9.61% improvement in the classification accuracy of multibranch EEGNet (MBEEGNet) from the fixed one-branch EEGNet model, and 2.95% from the variable EEGNet model. In addition, the multibranch ShallowConvNet (MBShallowConvNet) improved the accuracy of a single-scale network by 6.84%. The proposed models outperformed other state-of-the-art EEG motor imagery classification methods."
35043274,"Sensorimotor rhythms-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have successfully been employed to address upper limb motor rehabilitation after stroke. In this context, becomes crucial the choice of features that would enable an appropriate electroencephalographic (EEG) sensorimotor activation/engagement underlying the favourable motor recovery. Here, we present a novel feature selection algorithm (GUIDER) designed and implemented to integrate specific requirements related to neurophysiological knowledge and rehabilitative principles. The GUIDER algorithm was tested on an EEG dataset collected from 13 subacute stroke participants. The comparison between the automatic feature selection procedure by means of GUIDER algorithm and the manual feature selection executed by an expert neurophysiologist returned similar performance in terms of both feature selection and classification. Our preliminary findings suggest that the choices of experienced neurophysiologists could be reproducible by an automatic approach. The proposed automatic algorithm could be apt to support the professional end-users not expert in BCI such as therapist/clinicians and, to ultimately foster a wider employment of the BCI-based rehabilitation after stroke."
35041605,"Highly sophisticated control based on a brain-computer interface (BCI) requires decoding kinematic information from brain signals. The forearm is a region of the upper limb that is often used in everyday life, but intuitive movements within the same limb have rarely been investigated in previous BCI studies. In this study, we focused on various forearm movement decoding from electroencephalography (EEG) signals using a small number of samples. Ten healthy participants took part in an experiment and performed motor execution (ME) and motor imagery (MI) of the intuitive movement tasks (Dataset I). We propose a convolutional neural network using a channel-wise variational autoencoder (CVNet) based on inter-task transfer learning. We approached that training the reconstructed ME-EEG signals together will also achieve more sufficient classification performance with only a small amount of MI-EEG signals. The proposed CVNet was validated on our own Dataset I and a public dataset, BNCI Horizon 2020 (Dataset II). The classification accuracies of various movements are confirmed to be 0.83 (±0.04) and 0.69 (±0.04) for Dataset I and II, respectively. The results show that the proposed method exhibits performance increases of approximately 0.09~0.27 and 0.08~0.24 compared with the conventional models for Dataset I and II, respectively. The outcomes suggest that the training model for decoding imagined movements can be performed using data from ME and a small number of data samples from MI. Hence, it is presented the feasibility of BCI learning strategies that can sufficiently learn deep learning with a few amount of calibration dataset and time only, with stable performance."
35008079,"<i>Objective.</i>Supernumerary robotic limbs are body augmentation robotic devices by adding extra limbs or fingers to the human body different from the traditional wearable robotic devices such as prosthesis and exoskeleton. We proposed a novel motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm based on the sixth-finger which imagines controlling the extra finger movements. The goal of this work is to investigate the electromyographic (EEG) characteristics and the application potential of MI-based BCI systems based on the new imagination paradigm (the sixth finger MI).<i>Approach.</i>Fourteen subjects participated in the experiment involving the sixth finger MI tasks and rest state. Event-related spectral perturbation was adopted to analyze EEG spatial features and key-channel time-frequency features. Common spatial patterns were used for feature extraction and classification was implemented by support vector machine. A genetic algorithm (GA) was used to select combinations of EEG channels that maximized classification accuracy and verified EEG patterns based on the sixth finger MI. And we conducted a longitudinal 4 weeks EEG control experiment based on the new paradigm.<i>Main results.</i>Event-related desynchronization (ERD) was found in the supplementary motor area and primary motor area with a faint contralateral dominance. Unlike traditional MI based on the human hand, ERD was also found in frontal lobe. GA results showed that the distribution of the optimal eight-channel is similar to EEG topographical distributions, nearing parietal and frontal lobe. And the classification accuracy based on the optimal eight-channel (the highest accuracy of 80% and mean accuracy of 70%) was significantly better than that based on the random eight-channel (<i>p</i>< 0.01).<i>Significance.</i>This work provided a new paradigm for MI-based MI system and verified its feasibility, widened the control bandwidth of the BCI system."
35002899,"Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCI) have been proposed as a means for stroke rehabilitation, which combined with virtual reality allows for introducing game-based interactions into rehabilitation. However, the control of the MI-BCI may be difficult to obtain and users may face poor performance which frustrates them and potentially affects their motivation to use the technology. Decreases in motivation could be reduced by increasing the users' sense of agency over the system. The aim of this study was to understand whether embodiment (ownership) of a hand depicted in virtual reality can enhance the sense of agency to reduce frustration in an MI-BCI task. Twenty-two healthy participants participated in a within-subject study where their sense of agency was compared in two different embodiment experiences: 1) avatar hand (with body), or 2) abstract blocks. Both representations closed with a similar motion for spatial congruency and popped a balloon as a result. The hand/blocks were controlled through an online MI-BCI. Each condition consisted of 30 trials of MI-activation of the avatar hand/blocks. After each condition a questionnaire probed the participants' sense of agency, ownership, and frustration. Afterwards, a semi-structured interview was performed where the participants elaborated on their ratings. Both conditions supported similar levels of MI-BCI performance. A significant correlation between ownership and agency was observed (<i>r</i> = 0.47, <i>p</i> = 0.001). As intended, the avatar hand yielded much higher ownership than the blocks. When controlling for performance, ownership increased sense of agency. In conclusion, designers of BCI-based rehabilitation applications can draw on anthropomorphic avatars for the visual mapping of the trained limb to improve ownership. While not While not reducing frustration ownership can improve perceived agency given sufficient BCI performance. In future studies the findings should be validated in stroke patients since they may perceive agency and ownership differently than able-bodied users."
35002658,"Mental state changes induced by stimuli under experimental settings or by daily events in real life affect task performance and are entwined with physical and mental health. In this study, we developed a physiological state indicator with five parameters that reflect the subject's real-time physiological states based on online EEG signal processing. These five parameters are attention, fatigue, stress, and the brain activity shifts of the left and right hemispheres. We designed a target detection experiment modified by a cognitive attention network test for validating the effectiveness of the proposed indicator, as such conditions would better approximate a real chaotic environment. Results demonstrated that attention levels while performing the target detection task were significantly higher than during rest periods, but also exhibited a decay over time. In contrast, the fatigue level increased gradually and plateaued by the third rest period. Similar to attention levels, the stress level decreased as the experiment proceeded. These parameters are therefore shown to be highly correlated to different stages of the experiment, suggesting their usage as primary factors in passive brain-computer interfaces (BCI). In addition, the left and right brain activity indexes reveal the EEG neural modulations of the corresponding hemispheres, which set a feasible reference of activation for an active BCI control system, such as one executing motor imagery tasks. The proposed indicator is applicable to potential passive and active BCI applications for monitoring the subject's physiological state change in real-time, along with providing a means of evaluating the associated signal quality to enhance the BCI performance."
34986475,"<i>Objective.</i>Motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) is one of the most important BCI paradigms and can identify the target limb of subjects from the feature of MI-based Electroencephalography signals. Deep learning methods, especially lightweight neural networks, provide an efficient technique for MI decoding, but the performance of lightweight neural networks is still limited and need further improving. This paper aimed to design a novel lightweight neural network for improving the performance of multi-class MI decoding.<i>Approach.</i>A hybrid filter bank structure that can extract information in both time and frequency domain was proposed and combined with a novel channel attention method channel group attention (CGA) to build a lightweight neural network Filter Bank CGA Network (FB-CGANet). Accompanied with FB-CGANet, the band exchange data augmentation method was proposed to generate training data for networks with filter bank structure.<i>Main results.</i>The proposed method can achieve higher 4-class average accuracy (79.4%) than compared methods on the BCI Competition IV IIa dataset in the experiment on the unseen evaluation data. Also, higher average accuracy (93.5%) than compared methods can be obtained in the cross-validation experiment.<i>Significance.</i>This work implies the effectiveness of channel attention and filter bank structure in lightweight neural networks and provides a novel option for multi-class motor imagery classification."
34971597,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) has been widely used in sports training and rehabilitation training. It is primarily based on action simulation, including movement imagery (MI) and movement observation (MO). However, the development of BCI technology is limited due to the challenge of getting an in-depth understanding of brain networks involved in MI, MO, and movement execution (ME). To better understand the brain activity changes and the communications across various brain regions under MO, ME, and MI, this study conducted the fist experiment under MO, ME, and MI. We recorded 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) from 39 healthy subjects (25 males, 14 females, all right-handed) during fist tasks, obtained intensities and locations of sources using EEG source imaging (ESI), computed source activation modes, and finally investigated the brain networks using spectral Granger causality (GC). The brain regions involved in the three motor conditions are similar, but the degree of participation of each brain region and the network connections among the brain regions are different. MO, ME, and MI did not recruit shared brain connectivity networks. In addition, both source activation modes and brain network connectivity had lateralization advantages."
34962871,"The motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been proposed as a potential physical rehabilitation technology. However, the low classification accuracy achievable with MI tasks is still a challenge when building effective BCI systems. We propose a novel MI classification model based on measurement of functional connectivity between brain regions and graph theory. Specifically, motifs describing local network structures in the brain are extracted from functional connectivity graphs. A graph embedding model called Ego-CNNs is then used to build a classifier, which can convert the graph from a structural representation to a fixed-dimensional vector for detecting critical structure in the graph. We validate our proposed method on four datasets, and the results show that our proposed method produces high classification accuracies in two-class classification tasks (92.8% for dataset 1, 93.4% for dataset 2, 96.5% for dataset 3, and 80.2% for dataset 4) and multiclass classification tasks (90.33% for dataset 1). Our proposed method achieves a mean Kappa value of 0.88 across nine participants, which is superior to other methods we compared it to. These results indicate that there is a local structural difference in functional connectivity graphs extracted under different motor imagery tasks. Our proposed method has great potential for motor imagery classification in future studies."
34961366,"The main goal of electroencephalography (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) research is to develop a fast and higher classification accuracy (CA) rate method than those of existing ones. Generally, in BCI applications, either motor imagery or event-related P300 based techniques are used for data recording. The stimulus duration (SD) and the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) are crucial two parameters directly affecting the decision speed of the BCI system. In this study, we investigated the performance of the P300 based application in terms of speed and CA for three kinds of protocols which are called fast, medium, and slow included different SD and the ISI values. The training and test data sets were recorded in one week of delay from 8 subjects. The features were extracted by standard deviation, variance, mean, Wavelet Transform and Fourier Transform techniques. Afterwards, they were classified by <i>the k</i>-nearest neighbor algorithm. We obtained 87.08%, 85.41% and 83.95% average CA rate for the fast, medium, and slow protocols, respectively. The obtained results showed that the proposed fast protocol method achieved CA rate between 78.33% and 93.33%. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that the fast protocol values can be used for establishing a more accurate and faster P300 based BCI."
34960399,"The brain has been understood as an interconnected neural network generally modeled as a graph to outline the functional topology and dynamics of brain processes. Classic graph modeling is based on single-layer models that constrain the traits conveyed to trace brain topologies. Multilayer modeling, in contrast, makes it possible to build whole-brain models by integrating features of various kinds. The aim of this work was to analyze EEG dynamics studies while gathering motor imagery data through single-layer and multilayer network modeling. The motor imagery database used consists of 18 EEG recordings of four motor imagery tasks: left hand, right hand, feet, and tongue. Brain connectivity was estimated by calculating the coherence adjacency matrices from each electrophysiological band (δ, θ, α and β) from brain areas and then embedding them by considering each band as a single-layer graph and a layer of the multilayer brain models. Constructing a reliable multilayer network topology requires a threshold that distinguishes effective connections from spurious ones. For this reason, two thresholds were implemented, the classic fixed (average) one and Otsu's version. The latter is a new proposal for an adaptive threshold that offers reliable insight into brain topology and dynamics. Findings from the brain network models suggest that frontal and parietal brain regions are involved in motor imagery tasks."
34954026,"Previous studies have attempted to separate single trial neural responses for events a person is likely to remember from those they are likely to forget using machine learning classification methods. Successful single trial classification holds potential for translation into the clinical realm for real-time detection of memory and other cognitive states to provide real-time interventions (i.e., brain-computer interfaces). However, most of these studies-and classification analyses in general- do not make clear if the chosen methodology is optimally suited for the classification of memory-related brain states. To address this problem, we systematically compared different methods for every step of classification (i.e., feature extraction, feature selection, classifier selection) to investigate which methods work best for decoding episodic memory brain states-the first analysis of its kind. Using an adult lifespan sample EEG dataset collected during performance of an episodic context encoding and retrieval task, we found that no specific feature type (including Common Spatial Pattern (CSP)-based features, mean, variance, correlation, features based on AR model, entropy, phase, and phase synchronization) outperformed others consistently in distinguishing different memory classes. However, extracting all of these feature types consistently outperformed extracting only one type of feature. Additionally, the combination of filtering and sequential forward selection was the optimal method to select the effective features compared to filtering alone or performing no feature selection at all. Moreover, although all classifiers performed at a fairly similar level, LASSO was consistently the highest performing classifier compared to other commonly used options (i.e., naïve Bayes, SVM, and logistic regression) while naïve Bayes was the fastest classifier. Lastly, for multiclass classification (i.e., levels of context memory confidence and context feature perception), generalizing the binary classification using the binary decision tree performed better than the voting or one versus rest method. These methods were shown to outperform alternative approaches for three orthogonal datasets (i.e., EEG working memory, EEG motor imagery, and MEG working memory), supporting their generalizability. Our results provide an optimized methodological process for classifying single-trial neural data and provide important insight and recommendations for a cognitive neuroscientist's ability to make informed choices at all stages of the classification process for predicting memory and other cognitive states."
34945880,"Neurofeedback training (NFT) has shown promising results in recent years as a tool to address the effects of age-related cognitive decline in the elderly. Since previous studies have linked reduced complexity of electroencephalography (EEG) signal to the process of cognitive decline, we propose the use of non-linear methods to characterise changes in EEG complexity induced by NFT. In this study, we analyse the pre- and post-training EEG from 11 elderly subjects who performed an NFT based on motor imagery (MI-NFT). Spectral changes were studied using relative power (RP) from classical frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, and beta), whilst multiscale entropy (MSE) was applied to assess EEG-induced complexity changes. Furthermore, we analysed the subject's scores from Luria tests performed before and after MI-NFT. We found that MI-NFT induced a power shift towards rapid frequencies, as well as an increase of EEG complexity in all channels, except for C3. These improvements were most evident in frontal channels. Moreover, results from cognitive tests showed significant enhancement in intellectual and memory functions. Therefore, our findings suggest the usefulness of MI-NFT to improve cognitive functions in the elderly and encourage future studies to use MSE as a metric to characterise EEG changes induced by MI-NFT."
34932480,"Limb motion decoding is an important part of brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Among the limb motion, sign language not only contains rich semantic information and abundant maneuverable actions but also provides different executable commands. However, many researchers focus on decoding the gross motor skills, such as the decoding of ordinary motor imagery or simple upper limb movements. Here we explored the neural features and decoding of Chinese sign language from electroencephalograph (EEG) signal with motor imagery and motor execution. Sign language not only contains rich semantic information, but also has abundant maneuverable actions, and provides us with more different executable commands. In this paper, twenty subjects were instructed to perform movement execution and movement imagery based on Chinese sign language. Seven classifiers are employed to classify the selected features of sign language EEG. L1 regularization is used to learn and select features that contain more information from the mean, power spectral density, sample entropy, and brain network connectivity. The best average classification accuracy of the classifier is 89.90% (imagery sign language is 83.40%). These results have shown the feasibility of decoding between different sign languages. The source location reveals that the neural circuits involved in sign language are related to the visual contact area and the pre-movement area. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed decoding strategy based on sign language can obtain outstanding classification results, which provides a certain reference value for the subsequent research of limb decoding based on sign language."
34932469,"Advances in the motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow control of several applications by decoding neurophysiological phenomena, which are usually recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) using a non-invasive technique. Despite significant advances in MI-based BCI, EEG rhythms are specific to a subject and various changes over time. These issues point to significant challenges to enhance the classification performance, especially in a subject-independent manner. To overcome these challenges, we propose MIN2Net, a novel end-to-end multi-task learning to tackle this task. We integrate deep metric learning into a multi-task autoencoder to learn a compact and discriminative latent representation from EEG and perform classification simultaneously. This approach reduces the complexity in pre-processing, results in significant performance improvement on EEG classification. Experimental results in a subject-independent manner show that MIN2Net outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques, achieving an F1-score improvement of 6.72 %, and 2.23 % on the SMR-BCI, and OpenBMI datasets, respectively. We demonstrate that MIN2Net improves discriminative information in the latent representation. This study indicates the possibility and practicality of using this model to develop MI-based BCI applications for new users without calibration."
34924942,"Motor imagery (MI) is an endogenous mental process and is commonly used as an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) strategy. Previous studies of P300 and MI-based (without online feedback) BCI have shown that mental states like fatigue can negatively affect participants' EEG signatures. However, exogenous stimuli cause visual fatigue, which might have a different mechanism than endogenous tasks do. Furthermore, subjects could adjust themselves if online feedback is provided. In this sense, it is still unclear how fatigue affects online MI-based BCI performance. With this question, 12 healthy subjects are recruited to investigate this issue, and an MI-based online BCI experiment is performed for four sessions on different days. The first session is for training, and the other three sessions differ in rest condition and duration-no rest, 16-min eyes-open rest, and 16-min eyes-closed rest-arranged in a pseudo-random order. Multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI) and short stress state questionnaire (SSSQ) reveal that general fatigue, mental fatigue, and distress have increased, while engagement has decreased significantly within certain sessions. However, the BCI performances, including percent valid correct (PVC) and information transfer rate (ITR), show no significant change across 400 trials. The results suggest that although the repetitive MI task has affected subjects' mental states, their BCI performances and feature separability within a session are not affected by the task significantly. Further electrophysiological analysis reveals that the alpha-band power in the sensorimotor area has an increasing tendency, while event-related desynchronization (ERD) modulation level has a decreasing trend. During the rest time, no physiological difference has been found in the eyes-open rest condition; on the contrary, the alpha-band power increase and subsequent decrease appear in the eyes-closed rest condition. In summary, this experiment shows evidence that mental states can change dramatically in the intensive MI-BCI practice, but BCI performances could be maintained."
34920443,"<i>Objective.</i>Brain-computer interface (BCI) aims to establish communication paths between the brain processes and external devices. Different methods have been used to extract human intentions from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Those based on motor imagery (MI) seem to have a great potential for future applications. These approaches rely on the extraction of EEG distinctive patterns during imagined movements. Techniques able to extract patterns from raw signals represent an important target for BCI as they do not need labor-intensive data pre-processing.<i>Approach.</i>We propose a new approach based on a 10-layer one-dimensional convolution neural network (1D-CNN) to classify five brain states (four MI classes plus a 'baseline' class) using a data augmentation algorithm and a limited number of EEG channels. In addition, we present a transfer learning method used to extract critical features from the EEG group dataset and then to customize the model to the single individual by training its late layers with only 12-min individual-related data.<i>Main results.</i>The model tested with the 'EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset' outperforms the current state-of-the-art models by achieving a99.38%accuracy at the group level. In addition, the transfer learning approach we present achieves an average accuracy of99.46%.<i>Significance.</i>The proposed methods could foster the development of future BCI applications relying on few-channel portable recording devices and individual-based training."
34906019,"Motor imagery (MI), defined as the ability to mentally represent an action without actual movement, has been used to improve motor function in athletes and, more recently, in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Several studies have investigated the neural correlates of motor imagery, which change also depending on the action imagined. This review focuses on locomotion, which is a crucial activity in everyday life and is often impaired by neurological conditions. After a general discussion on the neural correlates of motor imagery and locomotion, we review the evidence highlighting the abnormalities in gait control and gait imagery in PD patients. Next, new perspectives and techniques for PD patients' rehabilitation are discussed, namely Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs), neurofeedback, and virtual reality (VR). Despite the few studies, the literature review supports the potential beneficial effects of motor imagery interventions in PD focused on locomotion. The development of new technologies could empower the administration of training based on motor imagery locomotor tasks, and their application could lead to new rehabilitation protocols aimed at improving walking ability in patients with PD."
34900346,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) based on kinesthetic motor imagery has a potential of becoming a groundbreaking technology in a clinical setting. However, few studies focus on a visual-motor imagery (VMI) paradigm driving BCI. The VMI-BCI feature extraction methods are yet to be explored in depth. In this study, a novel VMI-BCI paradigm is proposed to execute four VMI tasks: imagining a car moving forward, reversing, turning left, and turning right. These mental strategies can naturally control a car or robot to move forward, backward, left, and right. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 25 subjects were collected. After the raw EEG signal baseline was corrected, the alpha band was extracted using bandpass filtering. The artifacts were removed by independent component analysis. Then, the EEG average instantaneous energy induced by VMI (VMI-EEG) was calculated using the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). The autoregressive model was extracted to construct a 12-dimensional feature vector to a support vector machine suitable for small sample classification. This was classified into two-class tasks: visual imagination of driving the car forward versus reversing, driving forward versus turning left, driving forward versus turning right, reversing versus turning left, reversing versus turning right, and turning left versus turning right. The results showed that the average classification accuracy of these two-class tasks was 62.68 ± 5.08%, and the highest classification accuracy was 73.66 ± 6.80%. The study showed that EEG features of O1 and O2 electrodes in the occipital region extracted by HHT were separable for these VMI tasks."
34899223,"Severely motor-disabled patients, such as those suffering from the so-called ""locked-in"" syndrome, cannot communicate naturally. They may benefit from brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) exploiting brain signals for communication and therewith circumventing the muscular system. One BCI technique that has gained attention recently is functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Typically, fNIRS-based BCIs allow for brain-based communication via voluntarily modulation of brain activity through mental task performance guided by visual or auditory instructions. While the development of fNIRS-BCIs has made great progress, the reliability of fNIRS-BCIs across time and environments has rarely been assessed. In the present fNIRS-BCI study, we tested six healthy participants across three consecutive days using a straightforward four-choice fNIRS-BCI communication paradigm that allows answer encoding based on instructions using various sensory modalities. To encode an answer, participants performed a motor imagery task (mental drawing) in one out of four time periods. Answer encoding was guided by either the visual, auditory, or tactile sensory modality. Two participants were tested outside the laboratory in a cafeteria. Answers were decoded from the time course of the most-informative fNIRS channel-by-chromophore combination. Across the three testing days, we obtained mean single- and multi-trial (joint analysis of four consecutive trials) accuracies of 62.5 and 85.19%, respectively. Obtained multi-trial accuracies were 86.11% for visual, 80.56% for auditory, and 88.89% for tactile sensory encoding. The two participants that used the fNIRS-BCI in a cafeteria obtained the best single- (72.22 and 77.78%) and multi-trial accuracies (100 and 94.44%). Communication was reliable over the three recording sessions with multi-trial accuracies of 86.11% on day 1, 86.11% on day 2, and 83.33% on day 3. To gauge the trade-off between number of optodes and decoding accuracy, averaging across two and three promising fNIRS channels was compared to the one-channel approach. Multi-trial accuracy increased from 85.19% (one-channel approach) to 91.67% (two-/three-channel approach). In sum, the presented fNIRS-BCI yielded robust decoding results using three alternative sensory encoding modalities. Further, fNIRS-BCI communication was stable over the course of three consecutive days, even in a natural (social) environment. Therewith, the developed fNIRS-BCI demonstrated high flexibility, reliability and robustness, crucial requirements for future clinical applicability."
34892627,"This study investigated the possibility of using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during right- and left-hand motor imagery tasks to select an optimum set of electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes for a brain computer interface. fNIRS has better spatial resolution allowing areas of brain activity to more readily be identified. The ReliefF algorithm was used to identify the most reliable fNIRS channels. Then, EEG electrodes adjacent to those channels were selected for classification. This study used three different classifiers of linear and quadratic discriminant analyses, and support vector machine to examine the proposed method.Clinical Relevance- Reducing the number of sensors in a BCI makes the system more usable for patients with severe disabilities."
34892589,"Despite continuous research, communication approaches based on brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are not yet an efficient and reliable means that severely disabled patients can rely on. To date, most motor imagery (MI)-based BCI systems use conventional spectral analysis methods to extract discriminative features and classify the associated electroencephalogram (EEG)-based sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) dynamics that results in relatively low performance. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) and complex network theory graph-based feature extraction methods as a novel way to improve MI-BCIs performance. Rooted in chaos theory, these features explore the nonlinear dynamics underlying the MI neural responses as a new informative dimension in classifying MI. EEG time series recorded from six healthy participants performing MI-Rest tasks were projected into multidimensional phase space trajectories in order to construct the corresponding recurrence plots (RPs). Eight nonlinear graph-based RQA features were extracted from the RPs then compared to the classical spectral features through a 5-fold nested cross-validation procedure for parameter optimization using a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Nonlinear graph-based RQA features were able to improve the average performance of MI-BCI by 5.8% as compared to the classical features. These findings suggest that RQA and complex network analysis could represent new informative dimensions for nonlinear characteristics of EEG signals in order to enhance the MI-BCI performance."
34892562,"Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems tend to suffer from performance degradation due to the presence of noise and artifacts in EEG data. This study is aimed at systematically investigating the robustness of state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning based EEG-BCI models for motor imagery classification against simulated channel-specific noise in EEG data, at various low values of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Our results illustrate higher robustness of deep learning based MI classification models compared to the traditional machine learning based model, while identifying a set of channels with large sensitivity to simulated channel-specific noise. The EEGNet is relatively more robust towards channel-specific noise than Shallow ConvNet and FBCSP. We propose a preliminary solution, based on activation function, to improve the robustness of the deep learning models. By using saturating nonlinearities, the percentage drop in classification accuracy for SNR of -18 dB had reduced from 10.99% to 6.53% for EEGNet and 14.05% to 3.57% for Shallow ConvNet. Through this study, we emphasize the need for a more precise solution for enhancing the robustness, and thereby usability of EEG-BCI systems."
34892512,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) based rehabilitation has been proven a promising method facilitating motor recovery. Recognizing motor intention is crucial for realizing BCI rehabilitation training. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) is a kind of electroencephalogram (EEG) inherent characteristics associated with motor intention. However, due to brain deficits poststroke, some patients are not able to generate ERD, which discourages them to be involved in BCI rehabilitation training. To boost ERD during motor imagery (MI), this paper investigates the effects of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on BCI classification performance. Eleven subjects participated in this study. The experiment consisted of two conditions: rTMS + MI versus sham rTMS + MI, which were arranged on different days. MI tests with 64-channel EEG recording were arranged immediately before and after rTMS and sham rTMS. Time-frequency analysis were utilized to measure ERD changes. Common spatial pattern was used to extract features and linear discriminant analysis was used to calculate offline classification accuracies. Paired-sample t-test and Wilcoxon signed rank tests with post-hoc analysis were used to compare performance before and after stimulation. Statistically stronger ERD (-13.93±12.99%) was found after real rTMS compared with ERD (-5.71±21.25%) before real rTMS (p<0.05). Classification accuracy after real rTMS (70.71±10.32%) tended to be higher than that before real rTMS (66.50±8.48%) (p<0.1). However, no statistical differences were found after sham stimulation. This research provides an effective method in improving BCI performance by utilizing neural modulation.Clinical Relevance- This study offers a promising treatment for patients who cannot be recruited in BCI rehabilitation training due to poor BCI classification performance."
34892509,"Accurate and low-power decoding of brain signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) is key to constructing brain-computer interface (BCI) based wearable devices. While deep learning approaches have progressed substantially in terms of decoding accuracy, their power consumption is relatively high for mobile applications. Neuromorphic hardware arises as a promising solution to tackle this problem since it can run massive spiking neural networks with energy consumption orders of magnitude lower than traditional hardware. Herein, we show the viability of directly mapping a continuous-valued convolutional neural network for motor imagery EEG classification to a spiking neural network. The converted network, able to run on the SpiNNaker neuromorphic chip, only shows a 1.91% decrease in accuracy after conversion. Thus, we take full advantage of the benefits of both deep learning accuracies and low-power neuro-inspired hardware, properties that are key for the development of wearable BCI devices."
34892481,"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) provide effective tools aimed at recognizing different brain activities, translate them into actions, and enable humans to directly communicate through them. In this context, the need for strong recognition performances results in increasingly sophisticated machine learning (ML) techniques, which may result in poor performance in a real application (e.g., limiting a real-time implementation). Here, we propose an ensemble approach to effectively balance between ML performance and computational costs in a BCI framework. The proposed model builds a classifier by combining different ML models (base-models) that are specialized to different classification sub-problems. More specifically, we employ this strategy with an ensemble-based architecture consisting of multi-layer perceptrons, and test its performance on a publicly available electroencephalography-based BCI dataset with four-class motor imagery tasks. Compared to previously proposed models tested on the same dataset, the proposed approach provides greater average classification performances and lower inter-subject variability."
34892456,"In the recent years, brain computer interfaces (BCI) using motor imagery have shown some limitations regarding the quality of control. In an effort to improve this promising technology, some studies intended to develop hybrid BCI with other technologies such as eye tracking which shows more reliability. However, the use of an eye tracker in the control of a robot might affect by itself the sense of agency (SoA) and the brain activity in the regions used for motor imagery (MI). Here, we explore the link between the sense of agency and the activity of the motor cortex. For this purpose, we used of a virtual arm projected on a surface which is either controlled by motion capture or controlled by gaze using an eye tracker. We found out that there is an activity in the motor cortex during the task of control by gaze and that having control over a projected robotic arm presents significant differences with the situation of observing the robot moving."
34892447,"Motor imagery-based brain computer interface (MI-BCI) is a representative active BCI paradigm which is widely employed in the rehabilitation field. In MI-BCI, a classification model is built to identify the target limb from MI-based EEG signals, but the performance of models cannot meet the demand for practical use. Lightweight neural networks in deep learning methods are used to build high performance models in MI-BCI. Small sample sizes and the lack of multi-scale information extraction in frequency domain limit the performance improvement of lightweight neural networks. To solve these problems, the Filter Bank Sinc-ShallowNet (FB-Sinc-ShallowNet) algorithm combined with the mixed noise adding method based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was proposed. The FB-Sinc-ShallowNet algorithm improves a lightweight neural network Sinc-ShallowNet with a filter bank structure corresponding to four sensory motor rhythms. The mixed noise adding method employs the EMD method to improve the quality of generated data. The proposed method was evaluated on the BCI competition IV IIa dataset and can achieve highest average accuracy of 77.2%, about 6.34% higher than state-of-the-art method Sinc-ShallowNet. This work implies the effectiveness of filter bank structure in lightweight neural networks and provides a novel option for data augmentation and classification of MI-based EEG signals, which can be applied in the rehabilitation field for decoding MI-EEG with few samples."
34891458,"Brain-Computer Interfaces are new technologies with a fast development due to their possible usages, which still require overcoming some challenges to be readily usable. The paradigm of motor imagery is among the ones in these types of systems where the pipeline is tuned to work with only one person as it fails to classify the signals of a different person. Deep Learning methods have been gaining attention for tasks involving high-dimensional unstructured data, like EEG signals, but fail to generalize when trained on small datasets. In this work, to acquire a benchmark, we evaluate the performance of several classifiers while decoding signals from a new subject using a leave-one-out approach. Then we test the classifiers on the previous experiment and a method based on transfer learning in neural networks to classify the signals of multiple persons at a time. The resulting neural network classifier achieves a classification accuracy of 73% on the evaluation sessions of four subjects at a time and 74% on three at a time on the BCI competition IV 2a dataset."
34891447,"Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is applied in the study of different cognitive processes or clinical conditions as enhancing cognitive skills, motor rehabilitation, and control. However, many approaches focus on using a robust classifier instead of providing a better feature space. This work develops a feature representation methodology through the kernel canonical correlation analysis to reveal nonlinear relations between filter-banked common spatial patterns (CSP) extracted. Our approach reveals nonlinear relations between ranked filter-banked multi-class CSP features and the labels in a finite-dimensional canonical space. We tested the performance of our methodology on the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a. The introduced feature representation using a classic linear SVM achieves accuracy rates competitive with the state-of-the-art BCI strategies. Besides, the processing pipeline allows identifying the spatial and spectral features driven by the underlying brain activity and best modeling the motor imagery intentions.Clinical relevance- This BCI strategy assesses the nonlinear relationships between time series to improve the interpretation of brain electrical activity, taking into account the spatial and spectral features driven by the underlying brain dynamic."
34891438,"Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) is a popular feature extraction algorithm used for electroencephalogram (EEG) data classification in brain-computer interfaces. One of the critical operations used in CSP is taking the average of trial covariance matrices for each class. In this regard, the arithmetic mean, which minimizes the sum of squared Euclidean distances to the data points, is conventionally used; however, this operation ignores the Riemannian geometry in the manifold of covariance matrices. To alleviate this problem, Fréchet mean determined using different Riemannian distances have been used. In this paper, we are primarily concerned with the following question: Does using the Fréchet mean with Riemannian distances instead of arithmetic mean in averaging CSP covariance matrices improve the subject-independent classification of motor imagery (MI)? To answer this question we conduct a comparative study using the largest MI dataset to date, with 54 subjects and a total of 21,600 trials of left-and right-hand MI. The results indicate a general trend of having a statistically significant better performance when the Riemannian geometry is used."
34891410,"Recently, deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have reported several promising results in the classification of Motor Imagery (MI) using Electroencephalography (EEG). With the gaining popularity of CNN-based BCI, the challenges in deploying it in a real-world mobile and embedded device with limited computational and memory resources need to be explored. Towards this objective, we investigate the impact of the magnitude-based weight pruning technique to reduce the number of parameters of the pre-trained CNN-based classifier while maintaining its performance. We evaluated the proposed method on an open-source Korea University dataset which consists of 54 healthy subjects' EEG, recorded while performing right-and left-hand MI. Experimental results demonstrate that the subject-independent model can be maximumly pruned to 90% sparsity, with a compression ratio of 4.77× while retaining classification accuracy at 84.44% with minimal loss of 0.02% when compared to the baseline model's performance. Therefore, the proposed method can be used to design more compact deep CNN- based BCIs without compromising on their performance."
34891409,"Multi-channel Electroencephalograph (EEG) signal is an important source of neural information for motor imagery (MI) limb movement intent decoding. The decoded MI movement intent often serve as potential control input for brain-computer interface (BCI) based rehabilitation robots. However, the presence of multiple dynamic artifacts in EEG signal leads to serious processing challenge that affects the BCI system in practical settings. Hence, this study propose a hybrid approach based on Low-rank spatiotemporal filtering technique for concurrent elimination of multiple EEG artifacts. Afterwards, a convolutional neural network based deep learning model (ConvNet-DL) that extracts neural information from the cleaned EEG signal for MI tasks decoding was built. The proposed method was studied in comparison with existing artifact removal methods using EEG signals of transhumeral amputees who performed five different MI tasks. Remarkably, the proposed method led to significant improvements in MI task decoding accuracy for the ConvNet-DL model in the range of 8.00~13.98%, while up to 14.38% increment was recorded in terms of the MCC: Mathew correlation coefficients at p<0.05. Also, a signal to error ratio of more than 11 dB was recorded by the proposed method.Clinical Relevance- This study showed that a combination of the proposed hybrid EEG artifact removal method and ConvNet-DL can significantly improve the decoding accuracy of MI upper limb movement tasks. Our findings may provide potential control input for BCI rehabilitation robotic systems."
34891407,"Correlation between brain and muscle signal is referred to as functional coupling. The amount of correlation between two signals greatly depends on the motor task performance. In this study, we designed the experimental paradigm with four types of motor tasks such as real hand grasping movement (RM), movement intention (Inten), motor imagery (MI) and only looking at virtual hand in three dimensional head mounted display (OL). We aimed to investigate EEG-EMG correlation with linear and nonlinear coupling methods. The results proved that high correlation could be occurred in RM and Inten tasks rather than MI and OL tasks in both linear and nonlinear methods. High coherence occurred in beta and gamma bands of RM and Inten tasks whereas no coherence was detected in MI and OL tasks. In terms of nonlinear correlation, the high mutual information was detected in RM and Inten tasks. There was slight mutual information in MI and OL tasks. The results showed that the coherence in the contralateral brain cortex was higher than in the ipsilateral motor cortex during motor tasks. Furthermore, the amount of EEG-EMG functional coupling changed according to the motor task executed."
34891328,"This study attempted to classify a small amount of electroencephalogram (EEG) data on five states: four tasks involving right index-finger flexion (kinesthetic motor imagery, visual motor imagery, motor execution, and motor observation) and resting with eyes open. We employed a convolutional neural network (CNN) as a classifier and compared the classification accuracies of two types of CNNs: 1) a ""single five-class CNN,"" which classified the aforementioned states with a single CNN and 2) ""multiple two-class CNNs,"" wherein ten CNNs that classify pairs of states were combined. In addition, the classification accuracies were compared between two scenarios: one wherein the EEGs from all 19 scalp probe electrodes (19-channel EEG) were adopted as input data for the CNN, and the other wherein the EEGs of four regions closely related to the motor execution and observation of the index finger (4-channel EEG) were adopted. The classification accuracies of the single five-class CNN with 19- and 4-channel EEGs were 48.2 ± 5.9% and 46.6 ± 6.9%, respectively, and those of the multiple two-class CNNs with 19- and 4-channel EEGs were 52.8 ± 9.7% and 47.5 ± 9.4%, respectively. These results indicate the effectiveness of multiple two-class CNNs that utilize the EEGs of all scalp electrodes as input data for classifying motor imagery, execution, and observation, even in the case of the marginal dataset."

Despite the advances in the field, BCIs are still far from the subject-independent decoding of brain activities, primarily due to substantial inter-subject variability. In this study, we examine the potential application of an ensemble CNN classifier to integrate the capabilities of CNN architectures and ensemble learning for decoding EEG signals collected in motor imagery experiments. The results prove the superiority of the proposed ensemble CNN in comparison with the average base CNN classifiers, with an improvement up to 9% in classification accuracy depending on the test subject. The results also show improvement with respect to the performance of a number of state-of-the-art methods that have been previously used for subject-independent classification in the same datasets used here (i.e., BCI Competition IV 2A and 2B datasets)."
34891260,"Multitasking motor imagery (MI) of the unilateral upper limb is potentially more valuable in stroke rehabilitation than the current conventional MI in both hands. In this paper, a novel experimental paradigm was designed to imagine two motions of unilateral upper limb, which is hand gripping and releasing, and elbow reciprocating left and right. During this experiment, the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were collected from 10 subjects. The time and frequency domains of the EEG signals were analyzed and visualized, indicating the presence of different Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) or Event-Related Synchronization (ERS) for the two tasks. Then the two tasks were classified through three different EEG decoding methods, in which the optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) based on FBCNet achieved an average accuracy of 67.8%, obtaining a good recognition result. This work not only can advance the studies of MI decoding of unilateral upper limb, but also can provide a basis for better upper limb stroke rehabilitation in MI-BCI."
34891254,"In this work, we propose to use a deep learning framework for decoding the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of human brain activities. More specifically, we learn an end-to-end model that recognizes natural images or motor imagery by the EEG data that is collected from the corresponding human neural activities. In order to capture the temporal information encoded in the long EEG sequences, we first employ an enhanced version of Transformer, i.e., gated Transformer, on EEG signals to learn the feature representation along a sequence of embeddings. Then a fully-connected Softmax layer is used to predict the classification results of the decoded representations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the gated Transformer approach, we conduct experiments on the image classification task for a human brain-visual dataset and the classification task for a motor imagery dataset. The experimental results show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance compared to multiple existing methods that are widely used for EEG classification."
34878977,"Brain-computer interface (BCI)-based stroke rehabilitation is an emerging field in which different studies have reported variable outcomes. Among the BCI paradigms, motor imagery (MI)-based closed-loop BCI is still the main pattern in rehabilitation training. It can estimate a patient' motor intention and provide corresponding feedback. However, the individual difference in the ability to generate event-related desynchronization (ERD) and the low classification accuracy of the multi-class scenario restrict the application of MI-based BCI. In the current study, a novel online action observation (AO)-based BCI was proposed. The visual stimuli of four types of hand movements were designed to simultaneously induce steady-state motion visual evoked potential (SSMVEP) in the occipital region and to activate the sensorimotor region. Task-related component analysis was performed to identify the SSMVEP. Results showed that the amplitude of the induced frequency in the SSMVEP had a negative relationship with the stimulus frequency. The classification accuracy in the four-class scenario reached 72.81 ± 13.55% within 2.5s. Importantly, the AO-based closed-loop BCI, which provided visual feedback based on the SSMVEP, could enhance ERD compared with AO-alone. The increased attentiveness might be one key factor for the enhancement of the ERD in the designed AO-based BCI. In summary, the proposed AO-based BCI provides a new insight for BCI-based rehabilitation."
34867174,"The classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is of significant importance in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Aiming to achieve intelligent classification of motor imagery EEG types with high accuracy, a classification methodology using the wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and the proposed deep residual convolutional networks (DRes-CNN) is proposed. Firstly, EEG waveforms are segmented into sub-signals. Then the EEG signal features are obtained through the WPD algorithm, and some selected wavelet coefficients are retained and reconstructed into EEG signals in their respective frequency bands. Subsequently, the reconstructed EEG signals were utilized as input of the proposed deep residual convolutional networks to classify EEG signals. Finally, EEG types of motor imagination are classified by the DRes-CNN classifier intelligently. The datasets from BCI Competition were used to test the performance of the proposed deep learning classifier. Classification experiments show that the average recognition accuracy of this method reaches 98.76%. The proposed method can be further applied to the BCI system of motor imagination control."
34858156,"Event-related desynchronization (ERD) is a relative attenuation in the spectral power of an electroencephalogram (EEG) observed over the sensorimotor area during motor execution and motor imagery. It is a well-known EEG feature and is commonly employed in brain-computer interfaces. However, its underlying neural mechanisms are not fully understood, as ERD is a single variable correlated with external events involving numerous pathways, such as motor intention, planning, and execution. In this study, we aimed to identify a dominant factor for inducing ERD. Participants were instructed to grasp their right hand with three different (10, 25, or 40%MVF: maximum voluntary force) levels under two distinct experimental conditions: a closed-loop condition involving real-time visual force feedback (VF) or an open-loop condition in a feedforward (FF) manner. In each condition, participants were instructed to repeat the grasping task a certain number of times with a timeline of Rest (10.0 s), Preparation (1.0 s), and Motor Execution (4.0 s) periods, respectively. EEG signals were recorded simultaneously with the motor task to evaluate the time-course of the event-related spectrum perturbation for each condition and dissect the modulation of EEG power. We performed statistical analysis of mu and beta-ERD under the instructed grasping force levels and the feedback conditions. In the FF condition (i.e., no force feedback), mu and beta-ERD were significantly attenuated in the contralateral motor cortex during the middle of the motor execution period, while ERD in the VF condition was maintained even during keep grasping. Only mu-ERD at the somatosensory cortex tended to be slightly stronger in high load conditions. The results suggest that the extent of ERD reflects neural activity involved in the motor planning process for changing virtual equilibrium point rather than the motor control process for recruiting motor neurons to regulate grasping force."

It is gaining increasing prominence in helping paralyzed individuals communicate with the real world. Achieving better classification accuracy is the major concern in the field of motor imagery-based BCI. To upgrade the classification performance, relevant features play a vital role. The relevant features can be selected by the extreme gradient Bayesian optimization (XGBO) method. In this paper, a combination of time-, frequency-, and spatial-related MI features are extracted to design a reliable MI-BCI system. The proposed method incorporates the XGBO algorithm for feature selection and the random forest for the classification of EEG signals. The potency of the proposed system was investigated using two public EEG datasets (BCI Competition III dataset IIIa and dataset IVa). A novel XGBO algorithm increases the accuracy and reduces the time consumption by reducing the dimensionality of features. The proposed algorithm selects the minimum number of features that increase the computational efficacy for MI-based BCI systems. The proposed method is compared with ANOVA, sequential forward selection, recursive feature elimination, and LASSO methods and the accuracy rate is increased with the lowest computation time. The proposed method achieves mean accuracies of 94.44% and 88.72% and classification errors of 5.56% and 11.28% for Datasets IIIa and IVa, respectively. It outperforms four state-of-art methods with 0.87% and 0.59% increases in the accuracy for Datasets IIIa and IVa, respectively."

We propose to discriminate the resting and motor imagery (MI) states with high accuracy using Fourier-based synchrosqueezing transform (FSST) as a feature extractor. FSST has been investigated and compared with other popular approaches in 28 healthy subjects for a total of 6657 trials. The accuracy and f-measure values were obtained as 99.8% and 0.99, respectively, when FSST was used as the feature extractor and singular value decomposition (SVD) as the feature selection method and support vector machines as the classifier. Moreover, this study investigated the use of data that contain certain amount of noise without any preprocessing in addition to the clean counterparts. Furthermore, the statistical analysis of EEG channels with the best discrimination (of resting and MI states) characteristics demonstrated that F4-Fz-C3-Cz-C4-Pz channels and several statistical features had statistical significance levels, [Formula: see text], less than 0.05. This study showed that the preparation of the movement can be detected in real-time employing FSST-SVD combination and several channels with minimal pre-processing effort."
34803647,"<b>Background:</b> Motor attempt and motor imagery (MI) are two common motor tasks used in brain-computer interface (BCI). They are widely researched for motor rehabilitation in patients with hemiplegia. The differences between the motor attempt (MA) and MI tasks of patients with hemiplegia can be used to promote BCI application. This study aimed to explore the accuracy of BCI and event-related desynchronization (ERD) between the two tasks. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> We recruited 13 patients with stroke and 3 patients with traumatic brain injury, to perform MA and MI tasks in a self-control design. The BCI accuracies from the bilateral, ipsilesional, and contralesional hemispheres were analyzed and compared between different tasks. The cortical activation patterns were evaluated with ERD and laterality index (LI). <b>Results:</b> The study showed that the BCI accuracies of MA were significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) higher than MI in the bilateral, ipsilesional, and contralesional hemispheres in the alpha-beta (8-30 Hz) frequency bands. There was no significant difference in ERD and LI between the MA and MI tasks in the 8-30 Hz frequency bands. However, in the MA task, there was a negative correlation between the ERD values in the channel CP1 and ipsilesional hemispheric BCI accuracies (<i>r</i> = -0.552, <i>p</i> = 0.041, <i>n</i> = 14) and a negative correlation between the ERD values in channel CP2 and bilateral hemispheric BCI accuracies (<i>r</i> = -0.543, <i>p</i> = 0.045, <i>n</i> = 14). While in the MI task, there were negative correlations between the ERD values in channel C4 and bilateral hemispheric BCI accuracies (<i>r</i> = -0.582, <i>p</i> = 0.029, <i>n</i> = 14) as well as the contralesional hemispheric BCI accuracies (<i>r</i> = -0.657, <i>p</i> = 0.011, <i>n</i> = 14). As for motor dysfunction, there was a significant positive correlation between the ipsilesional BCI accuracies and FMA scores of the hand part in 8-13 Hz (<i>r</i> = 0.565, <i>p</i> = 0.035, <i>n</i> = 14) in the MA task and a significant positive correlation between the ipsilesional BCI accuracies and FMA scores of the hand part in 13-30 Hz (<i>r</i> = 0.558, <i>p</i> = 0.038, <i>n</i> = 14) in the MI task. <b>Conclusion:</b> The MA task may achieve better BCI accuracy but have similar cortical activations with the MI task. Cortical activation (ERD) may influence the BCI accuracy, which should be carefully considered in the BCI motor rehabilitation of patients with hemiplegia."
34803600,"A motor imagery (MI) brain-computer interface (BCI) plays an important role in the neurological rehabilitation training for stroke patients. Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based MI BCI has high temporal resolution, which is convenient for real-time BCI control. Therefore, we focus on EEG-based MI BCI in this paper. The identification of MI EEG signals is always quite challenging. Due to high inter-session/subject variability, each subject should spend long and tedious calibration time in collecting amounts of labeled samples for a subject-specific model. To cope with this problem, we present a supervised selective cross-subject transfer learning (sSCSTL) approach which simultaneously makes use of the labeled samples from target and source subjects based on Riemannian tangent space. Since the covariance matrices representing the multi-channel EEG signals belong to the smooth Riemannian manifold, we perform the Riemannian alignment to make the covariance matrices from different subjects close to each other. Then, all aligned covariance matrices are converted into the Riemannian tangent space features to train a classifier in the Euclidean space. To investigate the role of unlabeled samples, we further propose semi-supervised and unsupervised versions which utilize the total samples and unlabeled samples from target subject, respectively. Sequential forward floating search (SFFS) method is executed for source selection. All our proposed algorithms transfer the labeled samples from most suitable source subjects into the feature space of target subject. Experimental results on two publicly available MI datasets demonstrated that our algorithms outperformed several state-of-the-art algorithms using small number of the labeled samples from target subject, especially for good target subjects."
34803582,"The motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is an intuitive interface that provides control over computer applications directly from brain activity. However, it has shown poor performance compared to other BCI systems such as P300 and SSVEP BCI. Thus, this study aimed to improve MI-BCI performance by training participants in MI with the help of sensory inputs from tangible objects (i.e., hard and rough balls), with a focus on poorly performing users. The proposed method is a hybrid of training and imagery, combining motor execution and somatosensory sensation from a ball-type stimulus. Fourteen healthy participants participated in the somatosensory-motor imagery (SMI) experiments (within-subject design) involving EEG data classification with a three-class system (signaling with left hand, right hand, or right foot). In the scenario of controlling a remote robot to move it to the target point, the participants performed MI when faced with a three-way intersection. The SMI condition had a better classification performance than did the MI condition, achieving a 68.88% classification performance averaged over all participants, which was 6.59% larger than that in the MI condition (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In poor performers, the classification performance in SMI was 10.73% larger than in the MI condition (62.18% vs. 51.45%). However, good performers showed a slight performance decrement (0.86%) in the SMI condition compared to the MI condition (80.93% vs. 81.79%). Combining the brain signals from the motor and somatosensory cortex, the proposed hybrid MI-BCI system demonstrated improved classification performance, this phenomenon was predominant in poor performers (eight out of nine subjects). Hybrid MI-BCI systems may significantly contribute to reducing the proportion of BCI-inefficiency users and closing the performance gap with other BCI systems."
34795879,"The Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) permits persons with impairments to interact with the real world without using the neuromuscular pathways. BCIs are based on artificial intelligence piloted systems. They collect brain activity patterns linked to the mental process and transform them into commands for actuators. The potential application of BCI systems is in the rehabilitation centres. In this context, a novel method is devised for automated identification of the Motor Imagery (MI) tasks. The contribution is an effective hybridization of the Multiscale Principal Component Analysis (MSPCA), Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), statistical features extraction from subbands, and ensemble learning-based classifiers for categorization of the MI tasks. The intended electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are segmented and denoised. The denoising is achieved with a Daubechies algorithm-based wavelet transform (WT) incorporated in the MSPCA. The WT with the 5th level of decomposition is used. Onward, the Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), with the 4th level of decomposition, is used for subbands formation. The statistical features are selected from each subband, namely, mean absolute value, average power, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Also, ratios of absolute mean values of adjacent subbands are computed and concatenated with other extracted features. Finally, the ensemble machine learning approach is used for the classification of MI tasks. The usefulness is evaluated by using the BCI competition III, MI dataset IVa. Results revealed that the suggested ensemble learning approach yields the highest classification accuracies of 98.69% and 94.83%, respectively, for the cases of subject-dependent and subject-independent problems."
34777531,"Recently, the brain-computer interface (BCI) has seen rapid development, which may promote the recovery of motor function in chronic stroke patients. Twelve stroke patients with severe upper limb and hand motor impairment were enrolled and randomly assigned into two groups: motor imagery (MI)-based BCI training with multimodal feedback (BCI group, <i>n</i> = 7) and classical motor imagery training (control group, <i>n</i> = 5). Motor function and electrophysiology were evaluated before and after the intervention. The Fugl-Meyer assessment-upper extremity (FMA-UE) is the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures include an increase in wrist active extension or surface electromyography (the amplitude and cocontraction of extensor carpi radialis during movement), the action research arm test (ARAT), the motor status scale (MSS), and Barthel index (BI). Time-frequency analysis and power spectral analysis were used to reflect the electroencephalogram (EEG) change before and after the intervention. Compared with the baseline, the FMA-UE score increased significantly in the BCI group (<i>p</i> = 0.006). MSS scores improved significantly in both groups, while ARAT did not improve significantly. In addition, before the intervention, all patients could not actively extend their wrists or just had muscle contractions. After the intervention, four patients regained the ability to extend their paretic wrists (two in each group). The amplitude and area under the curve of extensor carpi radialis improved to some extent, but there was no statistical significance between the groups. MI-based BCI combined with sensory and visual feedback might improve severe upper limb and hand impairment in chronic stroke patients, showing the potential for application in rehabilitation medicine."
34770553,"Motor Imagery (MI)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have been widely used as an alternative communication channel to patients with severe motor disabilities, achieving high classification accuracy through machine learning techniques. Recently, deep learning techniques have spotlighted the state-of-the-art of MI-based BCIs. These techniques still lack strategies to quantify predictive uncertainty and may produce overconfident predictions. In this work, methods to enhance the performance of existing MI-based BCIs are proposed in order to obtain a more reliable system for real application scenarios. First, the Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) method is proposed on MI deep neural models to improve classification and provide uncertainty estimation. This approach was implemented using Shallow Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN-MCD) and with an ensemble model (E-SCNN-MCD). As another contribution, to discriminate MI task predictions of high uncertainty, a threshold approach is introduced and tested for both SCNN-MCD and E-SCNN-MCD approaches. The BCI Competition IV Databases 2a and 2b were used to evaluate the proposed methods for both subject-specific and non-subject-specific strategies, obtaining encouraging results for MI recognition."
34748509,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been widely employed to identify and estimate a user's intention to trigger a robotic device by decoding motor imagery (MI) from an electroencephalogram (EEG). However, developing a BCI system driven by MI related to natural hand-grasp tasks is challenging due to its high complexity. Although numerous BCI studies have successfully decoded large body parts, such as the movement intention of both hands, arms, or legs, research on MI decoding of high-level behaviors such as hand grasping is essential to further expand the versatility of MI-based BCIs. In this study, we propose NeuroGrasp, a dual-stage deep learning framework that decodes multiple hand grasping from EEG signals under the MI paradigm. The proposed method effectively uses an EEG and electromyography (EMG)-based learning, such that EEG-based inference at test phase becomes possible. The EMG guidance during model training allows BCIs to predict hand grasp types from EEG signals accurately. Consequently, NeuroGrasp improved classification performance offline, and demonstrated a stable classification performance online. Across 12 subjects, we obtained an average offline classification accuracy of 0.68 (±0.09) in four-grasp-type classifications and 0.86 (±0.04) in two-grasp category classifications. In addition, we obtained an average online classification accuracy of 0.65 (±0.09) and 0.79 (±0.09) across six high-performance subjects. Because the proposed method has demonstrated a stable classification performance when evaluated either online or offline, in the future, we expect that the proposed method could contribute to different BCI applications, including robotic hands or neuroprosthetics for handling everyday objects."
34735347,"With the development of the brain-computer interface (BCI) community, motor imagery-based BCI system using electroencephalogram (EEG) has attracted increasing attention because of its portability and low cost. Concerning the multi-channel EEG, the frequency component is one of the most critical features. However, insufficient extraction hinders the development and application of MI-BCIs. To deeply mine the frequency information, we proposed a method called tensor-based frequency feature combination (TFFC). It combined tensor-to-vector projection (TVP), fast fourier transform (FFT), common spatial pattern (CSP) and feature fusion to construct a new feature set. With two datasets, we used different classifiers to compare TFFC with the state-of-the-art feature extraction methods. The experimental results showed that our proposed TFFC could robustly improve the classification accuracy of about 5% (p < 0.01). Moreover, visualization analysis implied that the TFFC was a generalization of CSP and Filter Bank CSP (FBCSP). Also, a complementarity between weighted narrowband features (wNBFs) and broadband features (BBFs) was observed from the averaged fusion ratio. This article certificates the importance of frequency information in the MI-BCI system and provides a new direction for designing a feature set of MI-EEG."

34720907,"Motor Imagery BCI systems have a high rate of users that are not capable of modulating their brain activity accurately enough to communicate with the system. Several studies have identified psychological, cognitive, and neurophysiological measures that might explain this MI-BCI inefficiency. Traditional research had focused on mu suppression in the sensorimotor area in order to classify imagery, but this does not reflect the true dynamics that underlie motor imagery. Functional connectivity reflects the interaction between brain regions during the MI task and resting-state network and is a promising tool in improving MI-BCI classification. In this study, 54 novice MI-BCI users were split into two groups based on their accuracy and their functional connectivity was compared in three network scales (Global, Large and Local scale) during the resting-state, left vs. right-hand motor imagery task, and the transition between the two phases. Our comparison of High and Low BCI performers showed that in the alpha band, functional connectivity in the right hemisphere was increased in High compared to Low aptitude MI-BCI users during motor imagery. These findings contribute to the existing literature that indeed connectivity might be a valuable feature in MI-BCI classification and in solving the MI-BCI inefficiency problem."
34720854,"Achieving high classification performance is challenging due to non-stationarity and low signal-to-noise ratio (low SNR) characteristics of EEG signals. Spatial filtering is commonly used to improve the SNR yet the individual differences in the underlying temporal or frequency information is often ignored. This paper investigates motor imagery signals via orthogonal wavelet decomposition, by which the raw signals are decomposed into multiple unrelated sub-band components. Furthermore, channel-wise spectral filtering via weighting the sub-band components are implemented jointly with spatial filtering to improve the discriminability of EEG signals, with an <i>l</i> <sub>2</sub>-norm regularization term embedded in the objective function to address the underlying over-fitting issue. Finally, sparse Bayesian learning with Gaussian prior is applied to the extracted power features, yielding an RVM classifier. The classification performance of SEOWADE is significantly better than those of several competing algorithms (CSP, FBCSP, CSSP, CSSSP, and shallow ConvNet). Moreover, scalp weight maps of the spatial filters optimized by SEOWADE are more neurophysiologically meaningful. In summary, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of SEOWADE in extracting relevant spatio-temporal information for single-trial EEG classification."
34714181,"<i>Background.</i> Neuropathic pain (NP) following spinal cord injury (SCI) affects the quality of life of almost 40% of the injured population. The modified brain connectivity was reported under different NP conditions. Therefore, brain connectivity was studied in the SCI population with and without NP with the aim to identify networks that are altered due to injury, pain, or both. <i>Methods.</i> The study cohort is classified into 3 groups, SCI patients with NP, SCI patients without NP, and able-bodied. EEG of each participant was recorded during motor imagery (MI) of paralyzed and painful, and nonparalyzed and nonpainful limbs. Phased locked value was calculated using Hilbert transform to study altered functional connectivity between different regions. <i>Results.</i> The posterior region connectivity with frontal, fronto-central, and temporal regions is strongly decreased mainly during MI of dominant upper limb (nonparalyzed and nonpainful limbs) in SCI no pain group. This modified connectivity is prominent in the alpha and high-frequency bands (beta and gamma). Moreover, oscillatory modified global connectivity is observed in the pain group during MI of painful and paralyzed limb which is more evident between fronto-posterior, frontocentral-posterior, and within posterior and within frontal regions in the theta and SMR frequency bands. Cluster coefficient and local efficiency values are reduced in patients with no reported pain group while increased in the PWP group. <i>Conclusion.</i> The altered theta band connectivity found in the fronto-parietal network along with a global increase in local efficiency is a consequence of pain only, while altered connectivity in the beta and gamma bands along with a decrease in cluster coefficient values observed in the sensory-motor network is dominantly a consequence of injury only. The outcomes of this study may be used as a potential diagnostic biomarker for the NP. Further, the expected insight holds great clinical relevance in the design of neurofeedback-based neurorehabilitation and connectivity-based brain-computer interfaces for SCI patients."

This study used EEG2Image based on a modified S-transform (MST) to convert EEG data into EEG-topography. This method retains the frequency-domain characteristics and spatial information of the EEG signals. Then, the CycleGAN is used to learn and generate motor-imagery EEG data of stroke patients. From the visual inspection, there is no difference between the EEG topographies of the generated and original EEG data collected from the stroke patients.

34706446,"The study examines the effectiveness of both neurofeedback and motor-imagery brain-computer interface (BCI) training, which promotes self-regulation of brain activity, using low-cost electroencephalography (EEG)-based wearable neurotechnology outside a clinical setting, as a potential treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Rwanda. Participants received training/treatment sessions along with a pre- and post- intervention clinical assessment, (N = 29; control n = 9, neurofeedback (NF, 7 sessions) n = 10, and motor-imagery (MI, 6 sessions) n = 10). Feedback was presented visually via a videogame. Participants were asked to regulate (NF) or intentionally modulate (MI) brain activity to affect/control the game. The NF group demonstrated an increase in resting-state alpha 8-12 Hz bandpower following individual training sessions, termed alpha 'rebound' (Pz channel, p = 0.025, all channels, p = 0.024), consistent with previous research findings. This alpha 'rebound', unobserved in the MI group, produced a clinically relevant reduction in symptom severity in NF group, as revealed in three of seven clinical outcome measures: PCL-5 (p = 0.005), PTSD screen (p = 0.005), and HTQ (p = 0.005). Data collection took place in environments that posed difficulties in controlling environmental factors. Nevertheless, this limitation improves ecological validity, as neurotechnology treatments must be deployable outside controlled environments, to be a feasible technological treatment. The study produced the first evidence to support a low-cost, neurotechnological solution for neurofeedback as an effective treatment of PTSD for victims of acute trauma in conflict zones in a developing country."
34675771,"Hybrid-modality brain-computer Interfaces (BCIs), which combine motor imagery (MI) bio-signals and steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs), has attracted wide attention in the research field of neural engineering. The number of channels should be as small as possible for real-life applications. However, most of recent works about channel selection only focus on either the performance of classification task or the effectiveness of device control. Few works conduct channel selection for MI and SSVEP classification tasks simultaneously. In this paper, a multitasking-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (EMMOA) was proposed to select appropriate channels for these two classification tasks at the same time. Moreover, a two-stage framework was introduced to balance the number of selected channels and the classification accuracy in the proposed algorithm. The experimental results verified the feasibility of multiobjective optimization methodology for channel selection of hybrid BCI tasks."
34674118,"To reduce the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) illiteracy phenomenon and improve the classification accuracy, this paper proposed a novel method combining paradigm selection and Riemann distance classification. Firstly, a novel sensitivity-based paradigm selection (SPS) algorithm is designed for the optimization of classification to find the best classification pattern through a sensitive indicator. Then, a generalized Riemann minimum distance mean (GRMDM) classifier is proposed by introducing a weight factor to fuse the Log-Euclidean Metric classifier and the Riemannian Stein divergence classifier. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a better performance for multi-class motor imagery tasks. The average classification accuracy on the BCI competition IV dataset2a is 80.98%, which is 11.04% higher than Stein divergence classifier on the original two-class paradigm. Furthermore, the proposed method demonstrates its capacity on reducing MI-BCI illiteracy.

34640992,"Motor imagery (MI) brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been used for a wide variety of applications due to their intuitive matching between the user's intentions and the performance of tasks. Applying dry electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes to MI BCI applications can resolve many constraints and achieve practicality. In this study, we propose a multi-domain convolutional neural networks (MD-CNN) model that learns subject-specific and electrode-dependent EEG features using a multi-domain structure to improve the classification accuracy of dry electrode MI BCIs. The proposed MD-CNN model is composed of learning layers for three domain representations (time, spatial, and phase). We first evaluated the proposed MD-CNN model using a public dataset to confirm 78.96% classification accuracy for multi-class classification (chance level accuracy: 30%). After that, 10 healthy subjects participated and performed three classes of MI tasks related to lower-limb movement (gait, sitting down, and resting) over two sessions (dry and wet electrodes). Consequently, the proposed MD-CNN model achieved the highest classification accuracy (dry: 58.44%; wet: 58.66%; chance level accuracy: 43.33%) with a three-class classifier and the lowest difference in accuracy between the two electrode types (0.22%, d = 0.0292) compared with the conventional classifiers (FBCSP, EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, and DeepConvNet) that used only a single domain. We expect that the proposed MD-CNN model could be applied for developing robust MI BCI systems with dry electrodes."
34640888,"Motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces have gained much attention in the last few years. They provide the ability to control external devices, such as prosthetic arms and wheelchairs, by using brain activities. Several researchers have reported the inter-communication of multiple brain regions during motor tasks, thus making it difficult to isolate one or two brain regions in which motor activities take place. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the brain's neural patterns is important for BCI in order to provide more useful and insightful features. Thus, brain connectivity provides a promising approach to solving the stated shortcomings by considering inter-channel/region relationships during motor imagination. This study used effective connectivity in the brain in terms of the partial directed coherence (PDC) and directed transfer function (DTF) as intensively unconventional feature sets for motor imagery (MI) classification. MANOVA-based analysis was performed to identify statistically significant connectivity pairs. Furthermore, the study sought to predict MI patterns by using four classification algorithms-an SVM, KNN, decision tree, and probabilistic neural network. The study provides a comparative analysis of all of the classification methods using two-class MI data extracted from the PhysioNet EEG database. The proposed techniques based on a probabilistic neural network (PNN) as a classifier and PDC as a feature set outperformed the other classification and feature extraction techniques with a superior classification accuracy and a lower error rate. The research findings indicate that when the PDC was used as a feature set, the PNN attained the greatest overall average accuracy of 98.65%, whereas the same classifier was used to attain the greatest accuracy of 82.81% with the DTF. This study validates the activation of multiple brain regions during a motor task by achieving better classification outcomes through brain connectivity as compared to conventional features. Since the PDC outperformed the DTF as a feature set with its superior classification accuracy and low error rate, it has great potential for application in MI-based brain-computer interfaces."
34640750,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) remains an emerging tool that seeks to improve the patient interaction with the therapeutic mechanisms and to generate neuroplasticity progressively through neuromotor abilities. Motor imagery (MI) analysis is the most used paradigm based on the motor cortex's electrical activity to detect movement intention. It has been shown that motor imagery mental practice with movement-associated stimuli may offer an effective strategy to facilitate motor recovery in brain injury patients. In this sense, this study aims to present the BCI associated with visual and haptic stimuli to facilitate MI generation and control the T-FLEX ankle exoskeleton. To achieve this, five post-stroke patients (55-63 years) were subjected to three different strategies using T-FLEX: stationary therapy (ST) without motor imagination, motor imagination with visual stimulation (MIV), and motor imagination with visual-haptic inducement (MIVH). The quantitative characterization of both BCI stimuli strategies was made through the motor imagery accuracy rate, the electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis during the MI active periods, the statistical analysis, and a subjective patient's perception. The preliminary results demonstrated the viability of the BCI-controlled ankle exoskeleton system with the beta rebound, in terms of patient's performance during MI active periods and satisfaction outcomes. Accuracy differences employing haptic stimulus were detected with an average of 68% compared with the 50.7% over only visual stimulus. However, the power spectral density (PSD) did not present changes in prominent activation of the MI band but presented significant variations in terms of laterality. In this way, visual and haptic stimuli improved the subject's MI accuracy but did not generate differential brain activity over the affected hemisphere. Hence, long-term sessions with a more extensive sample and a more robust algorithm should be carried out to evaluate the impact of the proposed system on neuronal and motor evolution after stroke."
34630055,"Motor imagery is a popular technique employed as a motor rehabilitation tool, or to control assistive devices to substitute lost motor function. In both said areas of application, artificial somatosensory input helps to mirror the sensorimotor loop by providing kinesthetic feedback or guidance in a more intuitive fashion than via visual input. In this work, we study directional and movement-related information in electroencephalographic signals acquired during a visually guided center-out motor imagery task in two conditions, i.e., with and without additional somatosensory input in the form of vibrotactile guidance. Imagined movements to the right and forward could be discriminated in low-frequency electroencephalographic amplitudes with group level peak accuracies of 70% with vibrotactile guidance, and 67% without vibrotactile guidance. The peak accuracies with and without vibrotactile guidance were not significantly different. Furthermore, the motor imagery could be classified against a resting baseline with group level accuracies between 76 and 83%, using either low-frequency amplitude features or μ and β power spectral features. On average, accuracies were higher with vibrotactile guidance, while this difference was only significant in the latter set of features. Our findings suggest that directional information in low-frequency electroencephalographic amplitudes is retained in the presence of vibrotactile guidance. Moreover, they hint at an enhancing effect on motor-related μ and β spectral features when vibrotactile guidance is provided."
34626685,"Common spatial pattern (CSP) is a prevalent method applied to feature extraction in motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) recorded by electroencephalogram (EEG). The selection of time windows and frequency bands prominently affects the performance of CSP algorithms. Concerning the joint optimization of these two parameters, several studies have utilized a unified framework based on different feature selection strategies and achieved considerable improvement. However, during the feature selection process, useful information could be discarded inevitably and the underlying internal structure of features could be neglected. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework termed time window filter bank common spatial pattern with multi-view optimization (TWFBCSP-MVO) to further boost the decoding of MI tasks. Concretely, after extracting CSP features from different time-frequency decompositions of EEG signals, a preliminary screening strategy based on variance ratio was devised to filter out the unrelated spatial patterns. We then introduced a multi-view learning strategy for the simultaneous optimization of time windows and frequency bands. A support vector machine classifier was trained to determine the output of the brain. An experimental study was conducted on two public datasets to verify the effectiveness of TWFBCSP-MVO. Results showed that the proposed TWFBCSP-MVO could help improve the performance of MI classification. In comparison to other competing methods, the proposed method performed significantly better (p<0.01). The proposed method is a promising contestant to improve the performance of practical MI-based BCIs."

Motor imagery (MI) signal detection is one of the BCI applications, where the movements of the hand and feet can be recognized via brain commands that can be further used to handle emergency situations. Design of BCI techniques encountered challenges of BCI illiteracy, poor signal to noise ratio, intersubject variability, complexity, and performance.

To deal with the challenges related to the complexity performance tradeoff, the frequency features of brain signal are utilized in this study. Feature matrix is created from the power of brain frequencies, and newly proposed relative power features are used. Analysis of the relative power of alpha sub-band to beta, gamma, and theta sub-band has been done. These proposed relative features are evaluated with the help of different classifiers. For motor imagery classification, the proposed approach resulted in a maximum accuracy of 93.51% compared to other existing approaches. To check the significance of newly added features, feature ranking approaches, namely, mutual information, chi-square, and correlation, are used. The ranking of features shows that the relative power features are significant for MI task classification. The chi-square provides the best tradeoff between accuracy and feature space. We found that the addition of relative power features improves the overall performance. The proposed models could also provide quick response having reduced complexity."
34611209,"Deep learning networks have been successfully applied to transfer functions so that the models can be adapted from the source domain to different target domains. This study uses multiple convolutional neural networks to decode the electroencephalogram (EEG) of stroke patients to design effective motor imagery (MI) brain-computer interface (BCI) system. This study has introduced 'fine-tune' to transfer model parameters and reduced training time. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated by the abilities of the models for two-class MI recognition. The results show that the best framework is the combination of the EEGNet and 'fine-tune' transferred model. The average classification accuracy of the proposed model for 11 subjects is 66.36%, and the algorithm complexity is much lower than other models.These good performance indicate that the EEGNet model has great potential for MI stroke rehabilitation based on BCI system. It also successfully demonstrated the efficiency of transfer learning for improving the performance of EEG-based stroke rehabilitation for the BCI system."
34606773,"The classification of motor imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) is a pivotal task in the biosignal classification process in the brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Currently, this bio-engineering-based technology is being employed by researchers in various fields to develop cutting-edge applications. The classification of real-time MI-EEG signals is the most challenging task in these applications. The prediction performance of the existing classification methods is still limited due to the high dimensionality and dynamic behaviors of the real-time EEG data. To enhance the classification performance of real-time BCI applications, this paper presents a new clustering-based ensemble technique called CluSem to mitigate this problem. We also develop a new brain game called CluGame using this method to evaluate the classification performance of real-time motor imagery movements. In this game, real-time EEG signal classification and prediction tabulation through animated balls are controlled via threads. By playing this game, users can control the movements of the balls via the brain signals of motor imagery movements without using any traditional input devices. Our results demonstrate that CluSem is able to improve the classification accuracy between 5% and 15% compared to the existing methods on our collected as well as the publicly available EEG datasets. The source codes used to implement CluSem and CluGame are publicly available at https://github.com/MdOchiuddinMiah/MI-BCI_ML."
34598502,"As an important way for human-computer interaction, the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) can decode personal motor intention directly by analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, a large amount of labeled data has to be collected for each new subject since EEG patterns vary between individuals. The long calibration phase severely limits the further development of MI-BCI. To tackle this problem, multi-source joint domain adaption (MJDA) and multi-source joint Riemannian adaption (MJRA) algorithms are proposed in this paper. Both methods aim to transfer knowledge from other subjects to the current subject who has only a small amount of labeled data. First, the common spatial pattern with Euclidean alignment is used to select source subjects who have similar spatial patterns to the target subject. Second, the covariance matrices of EEG trials are aligned in Riemannian space by removing subject-specific baselines. These two steps are shared by MJDA and MJRA. In the last step, MJDA attempts to minimize the feature distribution mismatch in the Riemannian tangent space, while MJRA attempts to find an adaptive Riemannian classifier. Finally, the proposed methods are validated on two datasets: BCI Competition IV 2a and online event-related desynchronization (ERD)-BCI. The experimental results demonstrate that both MJDA and MJRA outperform the state-of-the-art approaches. The MJDA provides a new idea for the offline analysis of MI-BCI, while MJRA could make a big difference to the online calibration of MI-BCI."
34582344,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) that enables people with severe motor disabilities to use their brain signals for direct control of objects have attracted increased interest in rehabilitation. To date, no study has investigated feasibility of the BCI framework incorporating both intracortical and scalp signals. <i>Methods</i>: Concurrent local field potential (LFP) from the hand-knob area and scalp EEG were recorded in a paraplegic patient undergoing a spike-based close-loop neurorehabilitation training. Based upon multimodal spatio-spectral feature extraction and Naive Bayes classification, we developed, for the first time, a novel LFP-EEG-BCI for motor intention decoding. A transfer learning (TL) approach was employed to further improve the feasibility. The performance of the proposed LFP-EEG-BCI for four-class upper-limb motor intention decoding was assessed. <i>Results</i>: Using a decision fusion strategy, we showed that the LFP-EEG-BCI significantly (p <0.05) outperformed single modal BCI (LFP-BCI and EEG-BCI) in terms of decoding accuracy with the best performance achieved using regularized common spatial pattern features. Interrogation of feature characteristics revealed discriminative spatial and spectral patterns, which may lead to new insights for better understanding of brain dynamics during different motor imagery tasks and promote development of efficient decoding algorithms. Moreover, we showed that similar classification performance could be obtained with few training trials, therefore highlighting the efficacy of TL. <i>Conclusion</i>: The present findings demonstrated the superiority of the novel LFP-EEG-BCI in motor intention decoding. <i>Significance</i>: This work introduced a novel LFP-EEG-BCI that may lead to new directions for developing practical neurorehabilitation systems with high detection accuracy and multi-paradigm feasibility in clinical applications."

This systematic review provides state-of-the-art applications of EEG-based BCIs, particularly those using motor-imagery (MI) data, to wheelchair control and movement. It presents a thorough examination of the different studies conducted since 2010, focusing on the algorithm analysis, features extraction, features selection, and classification techniques used as well as on wheelchair components and performance evaluation. The results provided in this paper could highlight the limitations of current biomedical instrumentations applied to people with severe disabilities and bring focus to innovative research topics."
34573253,"Motor imagery engages much of the same neural circuits as an overt movement. Therefore, the mental rehearsal of movements is often used to supplement physical training and might aid motor neurorehabilitation after stroke. One attempt to capture the brain's involvement in imagery involves the use, as a marker, of the depression or event-related desynchronization (ERD) of thalamocortical sensorimotor rhythms found in a human electroencephalogram (EEG). Using fast real-time processing, it is possible to make the subject aware of their own brain reactions or-even better-to turn them into actions through a technology called the brain-computer interface (BCI). However, it remains unclear whether BCI-enabled imagery facilitates a stronger or qualitatively different brain response compared to the open-loop training. Seven healthy volunteers who were experienced in both closed and open-loop motor imagery took part in six experimental sessions over a period of 4.5 months, in which they performed kinesthetic imagery of a previously known set of finger and arm movements with simultaneous 30-channel EEG acquisition. The first and the last session mostly consisted of feedback trials in which the subjects were presented with the classification results of the EEG patterns in real time; during the other sessions, no feedback was provided. Spatiotemporal and amplitude features of the ERD patterns concomitant with imagery were compared across experimental days and between feedback conditions using linear mixed-effects modeling. The main spatial sources of ERD appeared to be highly stable across the six experimental days, remaining nearly identical in five of seven subjects (Pearson's ρ > 0.94). Only in one subject did the spatial pattern of activation statistically significantly differ (<i>p</i> = 0.009) between the feedback and no-feedback conditions. Real-time visual feedback delivered through the BCI did not significantly increase the ERD strength. The results imply that the potential benefits of MI could be yielded by well-habituated subjects with a simplified open-loop setup, e.g., through at-home self-practice."
34571497,"<i>Objective.</i>Motor imagery (MI), based on the theory of mirror neurons and neuroplasticity, can promote motor cortical activation in neurorehabilitation. The strategy of MI based on brain-computer interface (BCI) has been used in rehabilitation training and daily assistance for patients with hemiplegia in recent years. However, it is difficult to maintain the consistency and timeliness of receiving external stimulation to neural activation in most subjects owing to the high variability of electroencephalogram (EEG) representation across trials/subjects. Moreover, in practical application, MI-BCI cannot highly activate the motor cortex and provide stable interaction owing to the weakness of the EEG feature and lack of an effective mode of activation.<i>Approach.</i>In this study, a novel hybrid BCI paradigm based on MI and vestibular stimulation motor imagery (VSMI) was proposed to enhance the capability of feature response for MI. Twelve subjects participated in a group of controlled experiments containing VSMI and MI. Three indicators, namely, activation degree, timeliness, and classification accuracy, were adopted to evaluate the performance of the task.<i>Main results.</i>Vestibular stimulation could significantly strengthen the suppression of<i>α</i>and<i>β</i>bands of contralateral brain regions during MI, that is, enhance the activation degree of the motor cortex (<i>p</i>< 0.01). Compared with MI, the timeliness of EEG feature-response achieved obvious improvements in VSMI experiments. Moreover, the averaged classification accuracy of VSMI and MI was 80.56% and 69.38%, respectively.<i>Significance.</i>The experimental results indicate that specific vestibular activity contributes to the oscillations of the motor cortex and has a positive effect on spontaneous imagery, which provides a novel MI paradigm and enables the preliminary exploration of sensorimotor integration of MI."
34565550,"The nonstationarity problem of EEG is very serious, especially for spontaneous signals, which leads to the poor effect of machine learning related to spontaneous signals, especially in related tasks across time, which correspondingly limits the practical use of brain-computer interface (BCI). In this paper, we proposed a new transfer learning algorithm, which can utilize the labeled motor imagery (MI) EEG data at the previous time to achieve better classification accuracies for a small number of labeled EEG signals at the current time. We introduced an adaptive layer into the full connection layer of a deep convolution neural network. The objective function of the adaptive layer was designed to minimize the Local Maximum Mean Discrepancy (LMMD) and the prediction error while minimizing the distance within each class (DWC) and maximizing the distance between classes within each domain (DBCWD). We verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on two public datasets. The classification accuracy of the proposed algorithm was higher than other comparison algorithms, and the paired t-test results also showed that the performance of the proposed algorithm was significantly different from that of other algorithms. The results of the confusion matrix and feature visualization showed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher classification accuracy than other algorithms when there was only a small amount of labeled MI EEG data at the current time. It can be promising to be applied to the field of BCI."
34543189,"Neural self-regulation is necessary for achieving control over brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). This can be an arduous learning process esspecially for motor imagery BCI. Various training methods were proposed to assist users in accomplishing BCI control and increase performance. Notably the use of biased feedback, i.e. non-realistic representation of performance. Benefits of biased feedback on performance and learning vary between users (e.g. depending on their initial level of BCI control) and remain speculative. To disentangle the speculations, we investigate what personality type, initial state and calibration performance (CP) could benefit from biased feedback. We conduct an experiment (n=30 for 2 sessions). The feedback provided to each group (n=10) is either positively, negatively or not biased. Statistical analyses suggest that interactions between bias and: 1) workload, 2) anxiety, and 3) self-control significantly affect online performance. For instance, low initial workload paired with negative bias is associated to higher peak performances (86%) than without any bias (69%). High anxiety relates negatively to performance no matter the bias (60%), while low anxiety matches best with negative bias (76%). For low CP, learning rate (LR) increases with negative bias only short term (LR=2%) as during the second session it severely drops (LR=-1%). We unveil many interactions between said human factors and bias. Additionally, we use prediction models to confirm and reveal even more interactions. This paper is a first step towards identifying optimal biased feedback for a personality type, state, and CP in order to maximize BCI performance and learning."
34539326,"Cerebral stroke is a common disease across the world, and it is a promising method to recognize the intention of stroke patients with the help of brain-computer interface (BCI). In the field of motor imagery (MI) classification, appropriate filtering is vital for feature extracting of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and consequently influences the accuracy of MI classification. In this case, a novel two-stage refine filtering method was proposed, inspired by Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which uses the gradients of any target concept flowing into the final convolutional layer to highlight the important part of training data for predicting the concept. In the first stage, MI classification was carried out and then the frequency band to be filtered was calculated according to the Grad-CAM of the MI classification results. In the second stage, EEG was filtered and classified for a higher classification accuracy. To evaluate the filtering effect, this method was applied to the multi-branch neural network proposed in our previous work. Experiment results revealed that the proposed method reached state-of-the-art classification kappa value levels and acquired at least 3% higher kappa values than other methods This study also proposed some promising application scenarios with this filtering method."
34533381,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) can be used for function replacement through the control of devices, such as prostheses, by identifying the subject's intent from brain activity. We process electroencephalography (EEG) signals related to motor imagery to improve the accuracy of intent classification. The original signals are decomposed into three layers based on db4 wavelet basis. The wavelet soft threshold denoising method is used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The sample entropy algorithm is used to extract the features of the signal after noise reduction and reconstruction. Combined with event-related synchronisation/desynchronisation (ERS/ERD) phenomenon, the sample entropy in the motor imagery time periods of C3, C4 and Cz is selected as the feature value. Feature vectors are then used as the input of three classifiers. From the evaluated classifiers, the backpropagation (BP) neural network provides the best EEG signal classification (93% accuracy). BP neural network is thus selected as the final classifier and used to design a prosthetic control system based on motor imagery. The classification results are wirelessly transmitted to control a prosthesis successfully via commands of hand opening, fist clenching, and external wrist rotation. Such functionality may allow amputees to complete simple activities of daily living. Thus, this study is valuable for subsequent developments in rehabilitation."
34513337,"The classification of electroencephalography (EEG) induced by the same joint is one of the major challenges for brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. In this paper, we propose a new framework, which includes two parts, feature extraction and classification. Based on local mean decomposition (LMD), cloud model, and common spatial pattern (CSP), a feature extraction method called LMD-CSP is proposed to extract distinguishable features. In order to improve the classification results multi-objective grey wolf optimization twin support vector machine (MOGWO-TWSVM) is applied to discriminate the extracted features. We evaluated the performance of the proposed framework on our laboratory data sets with three motor imagery (MI) tasks of the same joint (shoulder abduction, extension, and flexion), and the average classification accuracy was 91.27%. Further comparison with several widely used methods showed that the proposed method had better performance in feature extraction and pattern classification. Overall, this study can be used for developing high-performance BCI systems, enabling individuals to control external devices intuitively and naturally."
34508756,"Motor imagery based brain computer interface (MI-BCI) has the advantage of strong independence that can rely on the spontaneous brain activity of the user to operate external devices. However, MI-BCI still has the problem of poor control effect, which requires more effective feature extraction algorithms and classification methods to extract distinctly separable features from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. This paper proposes a novel framework based on Bispectrum, Entropy and common spatial pattern (BECSP). Here we use three methods of bispectrum in higher order spectra, entropy and CSP to extract MI-EEG signal features, and then select the most contributing features through tree-based feature selection algorithm. By comparing the classification results of SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, LDA, KNN, Xgboost and Adaboost, we finally decide to use the SVM algorithm based on RBF kernel function which obtained the best result among them for classification. The proposed method is applied to the BCI competition IV data set 2a and BCI competition III data set IVa. On data set 2a, the highest accuracy on the evaluation data set reaches 85%. The experiment on data set IVa can also achieve good results. Compared with other algorithms that use the same data set, the performance of our algorithm has also been improved."
34507311,"<i>Objective</i>. Decoding imagined speech from brain signals could provide a more natural, user-friendly way for developing the next generation of the brain-computer interface (BCI). With the advantages of non-invasive, portable, relatively high spatial resolution and insensitivity to motion artifacts, the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) shows great potential for developing the non-invasive speech BCI. However, there is a lack of fNIRS evidence in uncovering the neural mechanism of imagined speech. Our goal is to investigate the specific brain regions and the corresponding cortico-cortical functional connectivity features during imagined speech with fNIRS.<i>Approach</i>. fNIRS signals were recorded from 13 subjects' bilateral motor and prefrontal cortex during overtly and covertly repeating words. Cortical activation was determined through the mean oxygen-hemoglobin concentration changes, and functional connectivity was calculated by Pearson's correlation coefficient.<i>Main results</i>. (a) The bilateral dorsal motor cortex was significantly activated during the covert speech, whereas the bilateral ventral motor cortex was significantly activated during the overt speech. (b) As a subregion of the motor cortex, sensorimotor cortex (SMC) showed a dominant dorsal response to covert speech condition, whereas a dominant ventral response to overt speech condition. (c) Broca's area was deactivated during the covert speech but activated during the overt speech. (d) Compared to overt speech, dorsal SMC(dSMC)-related functional connections were enhanced during the covert speech.<i>Significance</i>. We provide fNIRS evidence for the involvement of dSMC in speech imagery. dSMC is the speech imagery network's key hub and is probably involved in the sensorimotor information processing during the covert speech. This study could inspire the BCI community to focus on the potential contribution of dSMC during speech imagery."
34483866,"One of the most significant challenges in the application of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) is the large performance variation, which often occurs over time or across users. Recent evidence suggests that the physiological states may explain this performance variation in BCI, however, the underlying neurophysiological mechanism is unclear. In this study, we conducted a seven-session motor-imagery (MI) experiment on 20 healthy subjects to investigate the neurophysiological mechanism on the performance variation. The classification accuracy was calculated offline by common spatial pattern (CSP) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms to measure the MI performance of each subject and session. Relative Power (RP) values from different rhythms and task stages were used to reflect the physiological states and their correlation with the BCI performance was investigated. Results showed that the alpha band RP from the supplementary motor area (SMA) within a few seconds before MI was positively correlated with performance. Besides, the changes of RP between task and pre-task stage from theta, alpha, and gamma band were also found to be correlated with performance both across time and subjects. These findings reveal a neurophysiological manifestation of the performance variations, and would further provide a way to improve the BCI performance."
34483816,"Dealing with subjects who are unable to attain a proper level of performance, that is, those with brain-computer interface (BCI) illiteracy or BCI inefficients, is still a major issue in human electroencephalography (EEG) BCI systems. The most suitable approach to address this issue is to analyze the EEG signals of individual subjects independently recorded before the main BCI tasks, to evaluate their performance on these tasks. This study mainly focused on non-linear analyses and deep learning techniques to investigate the significant relationship between the intrinsic characteristics of a prior idle resting state and the subsequent BCI performance. To achieve this main objective, a public EEG motor/movement imagery dataset that constituted two individual EEG signals recorded from an idle resting state and a motor imagery BCI task was used in this study. For the EEG processing in the prior resting state, spectral analysis but also non-linear analyses, such as sample entropy, permutation entropy, and recurrent quantification analyses (RQA), were performed to obtain individual groups of EEG features to represent intrinsic EEG characteristics in the subject. For the EEG signals in the BCI tasks, four individual decoding methods, as a filter-bank common spatial pattern-based classifier and three types of convolution neural network-based classifiers, quantified the subsequent BCI performance in the subject. Statistical linear regression and ANOVA with <i>post hoc</i> analyses verified the significant relationship between non-linear EEG features in the prior resting state and three types of BCI performance as low-, intermediate-, and high-performance groups that were statistically discriminated by the subsequent BCI performance. As a result, we found that the frontal theta rhythm ranging from 4 to 8 Hz during the eyes open condition was highly associated with the subsequent BCI performance. The RQA findings that higher determinism and lower mean recurrent time were mainly observed in higher-performance groups indicate that more regular and stable properties in the EEG signals over the frontal regions during the prior resting state would provide a critical clue to assess an individual BCI ability in the following motor imagery task."
34478922,"Stroke is the second foremost cause of death worldwide and is one of the most common causes of disability. Several approaches have been proposed to manage stroke patient rehabilitation such as robotic devices and virtual reality systems, and researchers have found that the brain-computer interfaces (BCI) approaches can provide better results. Therefore, the most challenging tasks with BCI applications involve identifying the best technique(s) that can reveal the neuron stimulus information from the patients' brains and extracting the most effective features from these signals as well. Accordingly, the main novelty of this paper is twofold: propose a new feature fusion method for motor imagery (MI)-based BCI and develop an automatic MI framework to detect the changes pre- and post-rehabilitation. This study investigated the electroencephalography (EEG) dataset from post-stroke patients with upper extremity hemiparesis. All patients performed 25 MI-based BCI sessions with follow up assessment visits to examine the functional changes before and after EEG neurorehabilitation. In the first stage, conventional filters and automatic independent component analysis with wavelet transform (AICA-WT) denoising technique were used. Next, attributes from time, entropy and frequency domains were computed, and the effective features were combined into time-entropy-frequency (TEF) attributes. Consequently, the AICA-WT and the TEF fusion set were utilised to develop an AICA-WT-TEF framework. Then, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbours (kNN) and random forest (RF) classification technique were tested for MI-based BCI rehabilitation. The proposed AICA-WT-TEF framework with RF classifier achieves the best results compared with other classifiers. Finally, the proposed framework and feature fusion set achieve a significant performance in terms of accuracy measures compared to the state-of-the-art. Therefore, the proposed methods could be crucial for improving the process of automatic MI rehabilitation and are recommended for implementation in real-time applications."
34473788,"Motor Imagery (MI) is a powerful tool to stimulate sensorimotor brain areas and is currently used in motor rehabilitation after a stroke. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether an illusion of movement induced by visuo-proprioceptive immersion (VPI) including tendon vibration (TV) and Virtual moving hand (VR) combined with MI tasks could be more efficient than VPI alone or MI alone on cortical excitability assessed using Electroencephalography (EEG). We recorded EEG signals in 20 healthy participants in 3 different conditions: MI tasks involving their non-dominant wrist (MI condition); VPI condition; and VPI with MI tasks (combined condition). Each condition lasted 3 minutes, and was repeated 3 times in randomized order. Our main judgment criterion was the Event-Related De-synchronization (ERD) threshold in sensori-motor areas in each condition in the brain motor area. The combined condition induced a greater change in the ERD percentage than the MI condition alone, but no significant difference was found between the combined and the VPI condition (p = 0.07) and between the VPI and MI condition (p = 0.20). This study demonstrated the interest of using a visuo-proprioceptive immersion with MI rather than MI alone in order to increase excitability in motor areas of the brain. Further studies could test this hypothesis among patients with stroke to provide new perspectives for motor rehabilitation in this population."
34458199,"Functional Magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures the small fluctuation of blood flow happening during task-fMRI in brain regions. This research investigated these active, imagery and passive movements in volunteers design to permit a comparison of their capabilities in activating the brain areas. In this applied research, the activity of the motor cortex during the right-wrist movement was evaluated in 10 normal volunteers under active, passive, and imagery conditions. T2* weighted, three-dimensional functional images were acquired using a BOLD sensitive gradient-echo EPI (echo planar imaging) sequence with echo time (TE) of 30 ms and repetition time (TR) of 2000 ms. The functional data, which included 248 volumes per subject and condition, were acquired using the blocked design paradigm. The images were analyzed by the SPM12 toolbox, MATLAB software. The findings determined a significant increase in signal intensity of the motor cortex while performing the test compared to the rest time (p< 0.05). It was also observed that the active areas in hand representation of the motor cortex are different in terms of locations and the number of voxels in different wrist directions. Moreover, the findings showed that the position of active centers in the brain is different in active, passive, and imagery conditions. Results confirm that primary motor cortex neurons play an essential role in the processing of complex information and are designed to control the direction of movement. It seems that the findings of this study can be applied for rehabilitation studies."
34450878,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) facilitate communication for people who cannot move their own body. A BCI system requires a lengthy calibration phase to produce a reasonable classifier. To reduce the duration of the calibration phase, it is natural to attempt to create a subject-independent classifier with all subject datasets that are available; however, electroencephalogram (EEG) data have notable inter-subject variability. Thus, it is very challenging to achieve subject-independent BCI performance comparable to subject-specific BCI performance. In this study, we investigate the potential for achieving better subject-independent motor imagery BCI performance by conducting comparative performance tests with several selective subject pooling strategies (i.e., choosing subjects who yield reasonable performance selectively and using them for training) rather than using all subjects available. We observed that the selective subject pooling strategy worked reasonably well with public MI BCI datasets. Finally, based upon the findings, criteria to select subjects for subject-independent BCIs are proposed here."
34440942,"<i>Background and Objectives:</i> The motor sequelae after a stroke are frequently persistent and cause a high degree of disability. Cortical ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes affecting the cortico-spinal pathways are known to cause a reduction of cortical excitability in the lesioned area not only for the local connectivity impairment but also due to a contralateral hemisphere inhibitory action. Non-invasive brain stimulation using high frequency repetitive magnetic transcranial stimulation (rTMS) over the lesioned hemisphere and contralateral cortical inhibition using low-frequency rTMS have been shown to increase the excitability of the lesioned hemisphere. Mental representation techniques, neurofeedback, and virtual reality have also been shown to increase cortical excitability and complement conventional rehabilitation. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> We aim to carry out a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial aiming to study the efficacy of immersive multimodal Brain-Computer Interfacing-Virtual Reality (BCI-VR) training after bilateral neuromodulation with rTMS on upper limb motor recovery after subacute stroke (>3 months) compared to neuromodulation combined with conventional motor imagery tasks. This study will include 42 subjects in a randomized controlled trial design. The main expected outcomes are changes in the Motricity Index of the Arm (MI), dynamometry of the upper limb, score according to Fugl-Meyer for upper limb (FMA-UE), and changes in the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS). The evaluation will be carried out before the intervention, after each intervention and 15 days after the last session. <i>Conclusions:</i> This trial will show the additive value of VR immersive motor imagery as an adjuvant therapy combined with a known effective neuromodulation approach opening new perspectives for clinical rehabilitation protocols."
34425566,"<i>Objective.</i>The evaluation of the long-term stability of ElectroCorticoGram (ECoG) signals is an important scientific question as new implantable recording devices can be used for medical purposes such as Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) or brain monitoring.<i>Approach.</i>The long-term clinical validation of wireless implantable multi-channel acquisition system for generic interface with neurons (WIMAGINE), a wireless 64-channel epidural ECoG recorder was investigated. The WIMAGINE device was implanted in two quadriplegic patients within the context of a BCI protocol. This study focused on the ECoG signal stability in two patients bilaterally implanted in June 2017 (P1) and in November 2019 (P2).<i>Methods</i>. The ECoG signal was recorded at rest prior to each BCI session resulting in a 32 month and in a 14 month follow-up for P1 and P2 respectively. State-of-the-art signal evaluation metrics such as root mean square (RMS), the band power (BP), the signal to noise ratio (SNR), the effective bandwidth (EBW) and the spectral edge frequency (SEF) were used to evaluate stability of signal over the implantation time course. The time-frequency maps obtained from task-related motor activations were also studied to investigate the long-term selectivity of the electrodes.<i>Main</i><i>results.</i>Based on temporal linear regressions, we report a limited decrease of the signal average level (RMS), spectral distribution (BP) and SNR, and a remarkable steadiness of the EBW and SEF.

The signal evaluation metrics of two quadriplegic patients during 32 months and 14 months respectively provide strong evidence that this wireless implant is well-suited for long-term ECoG recording.<i>Significance.</i>These findings are relevant for the future of implantable BCIs, and could benefit other patients with spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, neuromuscular diseases or drug-resistant epilepsy."
34424453,"A motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG) signal is often selected as the driving signal in an active brain computer interface (BCI) system, and it has been a popular field to recognize MI-EEG images via convolutional neural network (CNN), which poses a potential problem for maintaining the integrity of the time-frequency-space information in MI-EEG images and exploring the feature fusion mechanism in the CNN. However, information is excessively compressed in the present MI-EEG image, and the sequential CNN is unfavorable for the comprehensive utilization of local features. In this paper, a multidimensional MI-EEG imaging method is proposed, which is based on time-frequency analysis and the Clough-Tocher (CT) interpolation algorithm. The time-frequency matrix of each electrode is generated via continuous wavelet transform (WT), and the relevant section of frequency is extracted and divided into nine submatrices, the longitudinal sums and lengths of which are calculated along the directions of frequency and time successively to produce a 3 × 3 feature matrix for each electrode. Then, feature matrix of each electrode is interpolated to coincide with their corresponding coordinates, thereby yielding a WT-based multidimensional image, called WTMI. Meanwhile, a multilevel and multiscale feature fusion convolutional neural network (MLMSFFCNN) is designed for WTMI, which has dense information, low signal-to-noise ratio, and strong spatial distribution. Extensive experiments are conducted on the BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets, and accuracies of 92.95% and 97.03% are yielded based on 10-fold cross-validation, respectively, which exceed those of the state-of-the-art imaging methods. The kappa values and p values demonstrate that our method has lower class skew and error costs. The experimental results demonstrate that WTMI can fully represent the time-frequency-space features of MI-EEG and that MLMSFFCNN is beneficial for improving the collection of multiscale features and the fusion recognition of general and abstract features for WTMI."
34407527,"<i>Objective.</i>Most current methods of classifying different patterns for motor imagery EEG signals require complex pre-processing and feature extraction steps, which consume time and lack adaptability, ignoring individual differences in EEG signals. It is essential to improve algorithm performance with the increased classes and diversity of subjects.<i>Approach.</i>This study introduces deep learning method for end-to-end learning to complete the classification of four-class MI tasks, aiming to improve the recognition rate and balance the classification accuracy among different subjects. A new one-dimensional input data representation method is proposed. This representation method can increase the number of samples and ignore the influence of channel correlation. In addition, a cascade network of convolutional neural network and gated recurrent unit is designed to learn time-frequency information from EEG data without extracting features manually, this model can capture the hidden representations related to different MI mode of each people.<i>Main results</i>. Experiments on BCI Competition 2a dataset and actual collected dataset achieve high accuracy near 99.40% and 92.56%, and the standard deviation is 0.34 and 1.35 respectively. Results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the advanced methods and baseline models.<i>Significance.</i>Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy of multi-classification and overcomes the impact of individual differences on classification by training neural network subject-dependent, which promotes the development of actual brain-computer interface systems."
34407522,"<i>Objective</i>. Recently, transfer learning (TL) and deep learning (DL) have been introduced to solve intra- and inter-subject variability problems in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, current TL and DL algorithms are usually validated within a single dataset, assuming that data of the test subjects are acquired under the same condition as that of training (source) subjects. This assumption is generally violated in practice because of different acquisition systems and experimental settings across studies and datasets. Thus, the generalization ability of these algorithms needs further validations in a cross-dataset scenario, which is closer to the actual situation. This study compared the transfer performance of pre-trained deep-learning models with different preprocessing strategies in a cross-dataset scenario.<i>Approach</i>. This study used four publicly available motor imagery datasets, each was successively selected as a source dataset, and the others were used as target datasets. EEGNet and ShallowConvNet with four preprocessing strategies, namely channel normalization, trial normalization, Euclidean alignment, and Riemannian alignment, were trained with the source dataset. The transfer performance of pre-trained models was validated on the target datasets. This study also used adaptive batch normalization (AdaBN) for reducing interval covariate shift across datasets. This study compared the transfer performance of using the four preprocessing strategies and that of a baseline approach based on manifold embedded knowledge transfer (MEKT). This study also explored the possibility and performance of fusing MEKT and EEGNet.<i>Main results</i>. The results show that DL models with alignment strategies had significantly better transfer performance than the other two preprocessing strategies. As an unsupervised domain adaptation method, AdaBN could also significantly improve the transfer performance of DL models. The transfer performance of DL models that combined AdaBN and alignment strategies significantly outperformed MEKT. Moreover, the generalizability of EEGNet models that combined AdaBN and alignment strategies could be further improved via the domain adaptation step in MEKT, achieving the best generalization ability among multiple datasets (BNCI2014001: 0.788, PhysionetMI: 0.679, Weibo2014: 0.753, Cho2017: 0.650).<i>Significance</i>. The combination of alignment strategies and AdaBN could easily improve the generalizability of DL models without fine-tuning. This study may provide new insights into the design of transfer neural networks for BCIs by separating source and target batch normalization layers in the domain adaptation process."
34406935,"This paper tackles the cross-sessions variability of electroencephalography-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in order to avoid the lengthy recalibration step of the decoding method before every use. We develop a new approach of domain adaptation based on optimal transport to tackle brain signal variability between sessions of motor imagery BCIs. We propose a backward method where, unlike the original formulation, the data from a new session are transported to a calibration session, and thereby avoiding model retraining. Several domain adaptation approaches are evaluated and compared. We simulated two possible online scenarios: i) block-wise adaptation and ii) sample-wise adaptation. In this study, we collect a dataset of 10 subjects performing a hand motor imagery task in 2 sessions. A publicly available dataset is also used. For the first scenario, results indicate that classifier retraining can be avoided by means of our backward formulation yielding to equivalent classification performance as compared to retraining solutions. In the second scenario, classification performance rises up to 90.23% overall accuracy when the label of the indicated mental task is used to learn the transport. Adaptive time is between 10 and 80 times faster than the other methods. The proposed method is able to mitigate the cross-session variability in motor imagery BCIs. The backward formulation is an efficient retraining-free approach built to avoid lengthy calibration times. Thus, the BCI can be actively used after just a few minutes of setup. This is important for practical applications such as BCI-based motor rehabilitation."
34384910,"Neurofeedback (NF) in combination with motor imagery (MI) can be used for training individuals to volitionally modulate sensorimotor activity without producing overt movements. However, until now, NF methods were of limited utility for mentally training specific hand and finger actions. Here we employed a novel transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) based protocol to probe and detect MI-induced motor activity patterns in the primary motor cortex (M1) with the aim to reinforce selective facilitation of single finger representations. We showed that TMS-NF training but not MI training with uninformative feedback enabled participants to selectively upregulate corticomotor excitability of one finger, while simultaneously downregulating excitability of other finger representations within the same hand. Successful finger individuation during MI was accompanied by strong desynchronization of sensorimotor brain rhythms, particularly in the beta band, as measured by electroencephalography. Additionally, informative TMS-NF promoted more dissociable EEG activation patterns underlying single finger MI, when compared to MI of the control group where no such feedback was provided. Our findings suggest that selective TMS-NF is a new approach for acquiring the ability of finger individuation even if no overt movements are performed. This might offer new treatment modality for rehabilitation after stroke or spinal cord injury."
34384059,"<i>Objective.</i>Spatial and spectral features extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG) are critical for the classification of motor imagery (MI) tasks. As prevalently used methods, the common spatial pattern (CSP) and filter bank CSP (FBCSP) can effectively extract spatial-spectral features from MI-related EEG. To further improve the separability of the CSP features, we proposed a distinguishable spatial-spectral feature learning neural network (DSSFLNN) framework for MI-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in this study.<i>Approach.</i>The first step of the DSSFLNN framework was to extract FBCSP features from raw EEG signals. Then two squeeze-and-excitation modules were used to re-calibrate CSP features along the band-wise axis and the class-wise axis, respectively. Next, we used a parallel convolutional neural network module to learn distinguishable spatial-spectral features. Finally, the distinguishable spatial-spectral features were fed to a fully connected layer for classification. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we compared it with the state-of-the-art methods on BCI competition IV datasets 2a and 2b.<i>Main results.</i>The results showed that the DSSFLNN framework can achieve a mean Cohen's kappa value of 0.7 on two datasets, which outperformed the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, two additional experiments were conducted and they proved that the combination of band-wise feature learning and class-wise feature learning can achieve significantly better performance than only using either one of them.<i>Significance.</i>The proposed DSSFLNN can effectively improve the decoding performance of MI-based BCIs."
34376123,"A significant problem in brain-computer interface (BCI) research is decoding - obtaining required information from very weak noisy electroencephalograph signals and extracting considerable information from limited data. Traditional intention decoding methods, which obtain information from induced or spontaneous brain activity, have shortcomings in terms of performance, computational expense and usage burden. Here, a new methodology called prediction error decoding was used for motor imagery (MI) detection and compared with direct intention decoding. Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) was used to induce subliminal sensory feedback between the forehead and mastoids without any burden. Prediction errors were generated between the GVS-induced sensory feedback and the MI direction. The corresponding prediction error decoding of the front/back MI task was validated. A test decoding accuracy of 77.83-78.86% (median) was achieved during GVS for every 100[Formula: see text]ms interval. A nonzero weight parameter-based channel screening (WPS) method was proposed to select channels individually and commonly during GVS. When the WPS common-selected mode was compared with the WPS individual-selected mode and a classical channel selection method based on correlation coefficients (CCS), a satisfactory decoding performance of the selected channels was observed. The results indicated the positive impact of measuring common specific channels of the BCI."
34376122,"Motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interfaces help patients with movement disorders to regain the ability to control external devices. Common spatial pattern (CSP) is a popular algorithm for feature extraction in decoding MI tasks. However, due to noise and nonstationarity in electroencephalography (EEG), it is not optimal to combine the corresponding features obtained from the traditional CSP algorithm. In this paper, we designed a novel CSP feature selection framework that combines the filter method and the wrapper method. We first evaluated the importance of every CSP feature by the infinite latent feature selection method. Meanwhile, we calculated Wasserstein distance between feature distributions of the same feature under different tasks. Then, we redefined the importance of every CSP feature based on two indicators mentioned above, which eliminates half of CSP features to create a new CSP feature subspace according to the new importance indicator. At last, we designed the improved binary gravitational search algorithm (IBGSA) by rebuilding its transfer function and applied IBGSA on the new CSP feature subspace to find the optimal feature set. To validate the proposed method, we conducted experiments on three public BCI datasets and performed a numerical analysis of the proposed algorithm for MI classification. The accuracies were comparable to those reported in related studies and the presented model outperformed other methods in literature on the same underlying data."
34372338,"Motor imagery (MI) promotes motor learning and encourages brain-computer interface systems that entail electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding. However, a long period of training is required to master brain rhythms' self-regulation, resulting in users with MI inefficiency. We introduce a parameter-based approach of cross-subject transfer-learning to improve the performances of poor-performing individuals in MI-based BCI systems, pooling data from labeled EEG measurements and psychological questionnaires via kernel-embedding. To this end, a Deep and Wide neural network for MI classification is implemented to pre-train the network from the source domain. Then, the parameter layers are transferred to initialize the target network within a fine-tuning procedure to recompute the Multilayer Perceptron-based accuracy. To perform data-fusion combining categorical features with the real-valued features, we implement stepwise kernel-matching via Gaussian-embedding. Finally, the paired source-target sets are selected for evaluation purposes according to the inefficiency-based clustering by subjects to consider their influence on BCI motor skills, exploring two choosing strategies of the best-performing subjects (source space): single-subject and multiple-subjects. Validation results achieved for discriminant MI tasks demonstrate that the introduced Deep and Wide neural network presents competitive performance of accuracy even after the inclusion of questionnaire data."
34366808,"In combined with neurofeedback, Motor Imagery (MI) based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) has been an effective long-term treatment therapy for motor dysfunction caused by neurological injury in the brain (e.g., post-stroke hemiplegia). However, individual neurological differences have led to variability in the single sessions of rehabilitation training. Research on the impact of short training sessions on brain functioning patterns can help evaluate and standardize the short duration of rehabilitation training. In this paper, we use the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to explore the brain patterns' changes after a short-term rehabilitation training. Using an EEG-BCI system, we analyzed the changes in short-term (about 1-h) MI training data with and without visual feedback, respectively. We first examined the EEG signal's Mu band power's attenuation caused by Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD). Then we use the EEG's Event-Related Potentials (ERP) features to construct brain networks and evaluate the training from multiple perspectives: small-scale based on single nodes, medium-scale based on hemispheres, and large-scale based on all-brain. Results showed no significant difference in the ERD power attenuation estimation in both groups. But the neurofeedback group's ERP brain network parameters had substantial changes and trend properties compared to the group without feedback. The neurofeedback group's Mu band power's attenuation increased but not significantly (fitting line slope = 0.2, <i>t</i>-test value <i>p</i> > 0.05) after the short-term MI training, while the non-feedback group occurred an insignificant decrease (fitting line slope = -0.4, <i>t</i>-test value <i>p</i> > 0.05). In the ERP-based brain network analysis, the neurofeedback group's network parameters were attenuated in all scales significantly (<i>t</i>-test value: <i>p</i> < 0.01); while the non-feedback group's most network parameters didn't change significantly (<i>t</i>-test value: <i>p</i> > 0.05). The MI-BCI training's short-term effects does not show up in the ERD analysis significantly but can be detected by ERP-based network analysis significantly. Results inspire the efficient evaluation of short-term rehabilitation training and provide a useful reference for subsequent studies."
34352734,"<i>Objective.</i>Motor-imagery (MI) classification base on electroencephalography (EEG) has been long studied in neuroscience and more recently widely used in healthcare applications such as mobile assistive robots and neurorehabilitation. In particular, EEG-based MI classification methods that rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved relatively high classification accuracy. However, naively training CNNs to classify raw EEG data from all channels, especially for high-density EEG, is computationally demanding and requires huge training sets. It often also introduces many irrelevant input features, making it difficult for the CNN to extract the informative ones. This problem is compounded by a dearth of training data, which is particularly acute for MI tasks, because these are cognitively demanding and thus fatigue inducing.<i>Approach.</i>To address these issues, we proposed an end-to-end CNN-based neural network with attentional mechanism together with different data augmentation (DA) techniques. We tested it on two benchmark MI datasets, brain-computer interface (BCI) competition IV 2a and 2b. In addition, we collected a new dataset, recorded using high-density EEG, and containing both MI and motor execution (ME) tasks, which we share with the community.<i>Main results.</i>Our proposed neural-network architecture outperformed all state-of-the-art methods that we found in the literature, with and without DA, reaching an average classification accuracy of 93.6% and 87.83% on BCI 2a and 2b, respectively. We also directly compare decoding of MI and ME tasks. Focusing on MI classification, we find optimal channel configurations and the best DA techniques as well as investigate combining data across participants and the role of transfer learning.<i>Significance.</i>Our proposed approach improves the classification accuracy for MI in the benchmark datasets. In addition, collecting our own dataset enables us to compare MI and ME and investigate various aspects of EEG decoding critical for neuroscience and BCI."
34343094,"In this study, we address the issue of whether vibrotactile feedback can enhance the motor cortex excitability translated into the plastic changes in local cortical areas during motor imagery (MI) BCI-based training. For this purpose, we focused on two of the most notable neurophysiological effects of MI - the event-related desynchronization (ERD) level and the increase in cortical excitability assessed with navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS). For TMS navigation, we used individual high-resolution 3D brain MRIs. Ten BCI-naive and healthy adults participated in this study. The MI (rest or left/right hand imagery using Graz-BCI paradigm) tasks were performed separately in the presence and absence of feedback. To investigate how much the presence/absence of vibrotactile feedback in MI BCI-based training could contribute to the sensorimotor cortical activations, we compared the MEPs amplitude during MI after training with and without feedback. In addition, the ERD levels during MI BCI-based training were investigated. Our findings provide evidence that applying vibrotactile feedback during MI training leads to (i) an enhancement of the desynchronization level of mu-rhythm EEG patterns over the contralateral motor cortex area corresponding to the MI of the non-dominant hand; (ii) an increase in motor cortical excitability in hand muscle representation corresponding to a muscle engaged by the MI."
34335210,"Brain-computer interface-assisted motor imagery (MI-BCI) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been proven effective in post-stroke motor function enhancement, yet whether the combination of MI-BCI and tDCS may further benefit the rehabilitation of motor functions remains unknown. This study investigated brain functional activity and connectivity changes after a 2 week MI-BCI and tDCS combined intervention in 19 chronic subcortical stroke patients. Patients were randomized into MI-BCI with tDCS group and MI-BCI only group who underwent 10 sessions of 20 min real or sham tDCS followed by 1 h MI-BCI training with robotic feedback. We derived amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and functional connectivity (FC) from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data pre- and post-intervention. At baseline, stroke patients had lower ALFF in the ipsilesional somatomotor network (SMN), lower ReHo in the contralesional insula, and higher ALFF/Reho in the bilateral posterior default mode network (DMN) compared to age-matched healthy controls. After the intervention, the MI-BCI only group showed increased ALFF in contralesional SMN and decreased ALFF/Reho in the posterior DMN. In contrast, no post-intervention changes were detected in the MI-BCI + tDCS group. Furthermore, higher increases in ALFF/ReHo/FC measures were related to better motor function recovery (measured by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment scores) in the MI-BCI group while the opposite association was detected in the MI-BCI + tDCS group. Taken together, our findings suggest that brain functional re-normalization and network-specific compensation were found in the MI-BCI only group but not in the MI-BCI + tDCS group although both groups gained significant motor function improvement post-intervention with no group difference. MI-BCI and tDCS may exert differential or even opposing impact on brain functional reorganization during post-stroke motor rehabilitation; therefore, the integration of the two strategies requires further refinement to improve efficacy and effectiveness."
34325128,"Brain-computer interfaces are a new pathway for communication between human body and the external environment. High classification accuracy for motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is desirable by improving the algorithm of feature extraction and classification. A novel algorithm (VLPSO-MFDF) based on the variable length particle swarm optimization (VLPSO) and multi-feature deep fusion (MFDF) is proposed. First, each layer of the deep forest is reconstructed into two same classification modules. Then, several different features are extracted for the motor imagery EEG signal to feed separately to the classification modules. The VLPSO is used to search for the optimal weights for the probability vectors output by each classification module, which can continuously optimize the classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the VLPSO-MFDF algorithm can achieve higher classification accuracy for four classifications of motor imagery EEG signals compared with the traditional deep forest algorithm. The proposed method fused multi-domain features and corrected the prediction difference. It was of great significance for improving the performance of the classifier."
34311452,"<i>Objective.</i>The original motor imagery electroencephalography (MI-EEG) data contains not only temporal features but also a large number of spatial features related to the distribution of electrodes on the brain. However, in the process of MI-EEG decoding, most of the current convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods do not make the utmost of the spatial features related to electrode distribution.<i>Approach.</i>In this study, we adopt a concise 3D representation for the MI-EEG data to take full advantage of the spatial features and propose a two-branch 3D CNN (TB-3D CNN) for the 3D representation of MI-EEG data. First, the spatial and temporal features of the input 3D samples are extracted by the spatial and temporal feature learning branches, respectively, to avoid the mutual interference between the temporal and spatial features. Then, the central loss is introduced into the TB-3D CNN framework to further improve the MI-EEG decoding accuracy. And a 3D data augmentation method based on the cyclic translation of time dimension is proposed for the 3D representation method to alleviate the overfitting problem.<i>Main results.</i>Some experiments are conducted on the famous BCI competition IV 2a dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MI-EEG decoding method. The experimental results comparison with some state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that the average accuracy of our method is 4.42% higher than that of the best of the comparative methods.<i>Significance.</i>The proposed MI-EEG decoding method has great promise to improve the performance of motor imagery brain-computer interface system."
34310314,"Motor imagery (MI) electroencephalography (EEG) decoding plays an important role in brain-computer interface (BCI), which enables motor-disabled patients to communicate with the outside world via external devices. Recent deep learning methods, which fail to fully explore both deep-temporal characterizations in EEGs itself and multi-spectral information in different rhythms, generally ignore the temporal or spectral dependencies in MI-EEG. Also, the lack of effective feature fusion probably leads to redundant or irrelative information and thus fails to achieve the most discriminative features, resulting in the limited MI-EEG decoding performance. To address these issues, in this paper, a MI-EEG decoding framework is proposed, which uses a novel temporal-spectral-based squeeze-and-excitation feature fusion network (TS-SEFFNet). First, the deep-temporal convolution block (DT-Conv block) implements convolutions in a cascade architecture, which extracts high-dimension temporal representations from raw EEG signals. Second, the multi-spectral convolution block (MS-Conv block) is then conducted in parallel using multi-level wavelet convolutions to capture discriminative spectral features from corresponding clinical subbands. Finally, the proposed squeeze-and-excitation feature fusion block (SE-Feature-Fusion block) maps the deep-temporal and multi-spectral features into comprehensive fused feature maps, which highlights channel-wise feature responses by constructing interdependencies among different domain features. Competitive experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that our method is able to achieve promising decoding performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods."
34306590,"Brain-computer interaction based on motor imagery (MI) is an important brain-computer interface (BCI). Most methods for MI classification are based on electroencephalogram (EEG), and few studies have investigated signal processing based on MI-Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). In addition, there is a need to improve the classification accuracy for MI fNIRS methods. In this study, a deep belief network (DBN) based on a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) was used to classify fNIRS signals of flexion and extension imagery involving the left and right arms. fNIRS signals from 16 channels covering the motor cortex area were recorded for each of 10 subjects executing or imagining flexion and extension involving the left and right arms. Oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) concentration was used as a feature to train two RBMs that were subsequently stacked with an additional softmax regression output layer to construct DBN. We also explored the DBN model classification accuracy for the test dataset from one subject using training dataset from other subjects. The average DBN classification accuracy for flexion and extension movement and imagery involving the left and right arms was 84.35 ± 3.86% and 78.19 ± 3.73%, respectively. For a given DBN model, better classification results are obtained for test datasets for a given subject when the model is trained using dataset from the same subject than when the model is trained using datasets from other subjects. The results show that the DBN algorithm can effectively identify flexion and extension imagery involving the right and left arms using fNIRS. This study is expected to serve as a reference for constructing online MI-BCI systems based on DBN and fNIRS."
34305558,"Over the last few decades, neuroimaging techniques have transformed our understanding of the brain and the effect of neurological conditions on brain function. More recently, light-based modalities such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy have gained popularity as tools to study brain function at the bedside. A recent application is to assess residual awareness in patients with disorders of consciousness, as some patients retain awareness albeit lacking all behavioural response to commands. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy can play a vital role in identifying these patients by assessing command-driven brain activity. The goal of this review is to summarise the studies reported on this topic, to discuss the technical and ethical challenges of working with patients with disorders of consciousness, and to outline promising future directions in this field."
34300386,"In recent years, more and more frameworks have been applied to brain-computer interface technology, and electroencephalogram-based motor imagery (MI-EEG) is developing rapidly. However, it is still a challenge to improve the accuracy of MI-EEG classification. A deep learning framework termed IS-CBAM-convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to address the non-stationary nature, the temporal localization of excitation occurrence, and the frequency band distribution characteristics of the MI-EEG signal in this paper. First, according to the logically symmetrical relationship between the C3 and C4 channels, the result of the time-frequency image subtraction (IS) for the MI-EEG signal is used as the input of the classifier. It both reduces the redundancy and increases the feature differences of the input data. Second, the attention module is added to the classifier. A convolutional neural network is built as the base classifier, and information on the temporal location and frequency distribution of MI-EEG signal occurrences are adaptively extracted by introducing the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). This approach reduces irrelevant noise interference while increasing the robustness of the pattern. The performance of the framework was evaluated on BCI competition IV dataset 2b, where the mean accuracy reached 79.6%, and the average kappa value reached 0.592. The experimental results validate the feasibility of the framework and show the performance improvement of MI-EEG signal classification."
34276292,"Collaborative brain-computer interfaces (cBCIs) can make the BCI output more credible by jointly decoding concurrent brain signals from multiple collaborators. Current cBCI systems usually require all collaborators to execute the same mental tasks (common-work strategy). However, it is still unclear whether the system performance will be improved by assigning different tasks to collaborators (division-of-work strategy) while keeping the total tasks unchanged. Therefore, we studied a task allocation scheme of division-of-work and compared the corresponding classification accuracies with common-work strategy's. This study developed an electroencephalograph (EEG)-based cBCI which had six instructions related to six different motor imagery tasks (MI-cBCI), respectively. For the common-work strategy, all five subjects as a group had the same whole instruction set and they were required to conduct the same instruction at a time. For the division-of-work strategy, every subject's instruction set was a subset of the whole one and different from each other. However, their union set was equal to the whole set. Based on the number of instructions in a subset, we divided the division-of-work strategy into four types, called ""2 Tasks"" … ""5 Tasks."" To verify the effectiveness of these strategies, we employed EEG data collected from 19 subjects who independently performed six types of MI tasks to conduct the pseudo-online classification of MI-cBCI. Taking the number of tasks performed by one collaborator as the horizontal axis (two to six), the classification accuracy curve of MI-cBCI was mountain-like. The curve reached its peak at ""4 Tasks,"" which means each subset contained four instructions. It outperformed the common-work strategy (""6 Tasks"") in classification accuracy (<b>72.29 ± 4.43</b> vs. 58.53 ± 4.36%). The results demonstrate that our proposed task allocation strategy effectively enhanced the cBCI classification performance and reduced the individual workload."
34273721,"Accurate characterization of brain activity during a cognitive task is challenging due to the dynamically changing and the complex nature of the brain. The majority of the proposed approaches assume stationarity in brain activity and disregard the systematic timing organization among brain regions during cognitive tasks. In this study, we propose a novel cognitive activity recognition method that captures the activity-specific timing parameters from training data that elicits maximal average short-lived pairwise synchronization between electroencephalography signals. We evaluated the characterization power of the activity-specific timing parameter triplets in a motor imagery activity recognition framework. The activity-specific timing parameter triplets consist of latency of the maximally synchronized signal segments from activity onset Δt, the time lag between maximally synchronized signal segments τ, and the duration of the maximally synchronized signal segments w. We used cosine-based similarity, wavelet bi-coherence, phase-locking value, phase coherence value, linearized mutual information, and cross-correntropy to calculate the channel synchronizations at the specific timing parameters. Recognition performances as well as statistical analyses on both BCI Competition-III dataset IVa and PhysioNet Motor Movement/Imagery dataset, indicate that the inter-channel short-lived synchronization calculated using activity-specific timing parameter triplets elicit significantly distinct synchronization profiles for different motor imagery tasks and can thus reliably be used for cognitive task recognition purposes."
34257636,"Compared with the efficacy of traditional physical therapy, a new therapy utilizing motor imagery can induce brain plasticity and allows partial recovery of motor ability in patients with hemiplegia after stroke. Here, we proposed an updated paradigm utilizing motor coordination imagery involving the lower limbs (normal gait imagery and hemiplegic gait imagery after stroke) and decoded such imagery via an electroencephalogram- (EEG-) based brain network. Thirty subjects were recruited to collect EEGs during motor coordination imagery involving the lower limbs. Time-domain analysis, power spectrum analysis, time-frequency analysis, brain network analysis, and statistical analysis were used to explore the neural mechanisms of motor coordination imagery involving the lower limbs. Then, EEG-based brain network features were extracted, and a support vector machine was used for decoding. The results showed that the two employed motor coordination imageries mainly activated sensorimotor areas; the frequency band power was mainly concentrated within theta and alpha bands, and brain functional connections mainly occurred in the right forehead. The combination of the network attributes of the EEG-based brain network and the spatial features of the adjacency matrix had good separability for the two kinds of gait imagery (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and the average classification accuracy of the combination feature was 92.96% ± 7.54%. Taken together, our findings suggest that brain network features can be used to identify normal gait imagery and hemiplegic gait imagery after stroke."
34233305,"<i>Objective.</i>Motor imagery is the mental simulation of movements. It is a common paradigm to design brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that elicits the modulation of brain oscillatory activity similar to real, passive and induced movements. In this study, we used peripheral stimulation to provoke movements of one limb during the performance of motor imagery tasks. Unlike other works, in which induced movements are used to support the BCI operation, our goal was to test and improve the robustness of motor imagery based BCI systems to perturbations caused by artificially generated movements.<i>Approach.</i>We performed a BCI session with ten participants who carried out motor imagery of three limbs. In some of the trials, one of the arms was moved by neuromuscular stimulation. We analysed 2-class motor imagery classifications with and without movement perturbations. We investigated the performance decrease produced by these disturbances and designed different computational strategies to attenuate the observed classification accuracy drop.<i>Main results.</i>When the movement was induced in a limb not coincident with the motor imagery classes, extracting oscillatory sources of the movement imagination tasks resulted in BCI performance being similar to the control (undisturbed) condition; when the movement was induced in a limb also involved in the motor imagery tasks, the performance drop was significantly alleviated by spatially filtering out the neural noise caused by the stimulation. We also show that the loss of BCI accuracy was accompanied by weaker power of the sensorimotor rhythm. Importantly, this residual power could be used to predict whether a BCI user will perform with sufficient accuracy under the movement disturbances.<i>Significance.</i>We provide methods to ameliorate and even eliminate motor related afferent disturbances during the performance of motor imagery tasks. This can help improving the reliability of current motor imagery based BCI systems."
34229308,"<i>Objective.</i>Voluntary control of sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs, 8-12 Hz) can be used for brain-computer interface (BCI)-based operation of an assistive hand exoskeleton, e.g. in finger paralysis after stroke. To gain SMR control, stroke survivors are usually instructed to engage in motor imagery (MI) or to attempt moving the paralyzed fingers resulting in task- or event-related desynchronization (ERD) of SMR (SMR-ERD). However, as these tasks are cognitively demanding, especially for stroke survivors suffering from cognitive impairments, BCI control performance can deteriorate considerably over time. Therefore, it would be important to identify biomarkers that predict decline in BCI control performance within an ongoing session in order to optimize the man-machine interaction scheme.<i>Approach.</i>Here we determine the link between BCI control performance over time and heart rate variability (HRV). Specifically, we investigated whether HRV can be used as a biomarker to predict decline of SMR-ERD control across 17 healthy participants using Granger causality. SMR-ERD was visually displayed on a screen. Participants were instructed to engage in MI-based SMR-ERD control over two consecutive runs of 8.5 min each. During the 2nd run, task difficulty was gradually increased.<i>Main results.</i>While control performance (<i>p</i>= .18) and HRV (<i>p</i>= .16) remained unchanged across participants during the 1st run, during the 2nd run, both measures declined over time at high correlation (performance: -0.61%/10 s,<i>p</i>= 0; HRV: -0.007 ms/10 s,<i>p</i>< .001). We found that HRV exhibited predictive characteristics with regard to within-session BCI control performance on an individual participant level (<i>p</i>< .001).<i>Significance.</i>These results suggest that HRV can predict decline in BCI performance paving the way for adaptive BCI control paradigms, e.g. to individualize and optimize assistive BCI systems in stroke."
34229027,"Sparse representation-based classification (SRC) has more advantages in motor imagery EEG pattern recognition, and the quality of dictionary construction directly determines the performance of SRC. In this paper, we proposed a two-dimensional dictionary optimization (TDDO) method to directly improve the performance of SRC. Firstly, an initial dictionary was constructed with multi-band features extracted by filter band common spatial pattern (FBCSP). Then Lasso regression is used to select significant features in each atom synchronously in the horizontal direction, and the KNN-based method is used to clean up noise atoms in the vertical direction. Finally, an SRC method by training samples linearly representing test samples was implemented in classification. The results show the necessity and rationality of TDDO-SRC method. The highest average classification accuracy of 86.5% and 92.4% is obtained on two public datasets. The proposed method has more superior classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and existing winners' methods. The quality of dictionary construction has a great impact on the robustness of SRC. And compared with the original SRC, the classification accuracy of the optimized TDDO-SRC is greatly improved."
34202413,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), based on motor imagery, are increasingly used in neurorehabilitation. However, some people cannot control BCI, predictors of this are the features of brain activity and personality traits. It is not known whether the success of BCI control is related to interhemispheric asymmetry. The study was conducted on 44 BCI-naive subjects and included one BCI session, EEG-analysis, 16PF Cattell Questionnaire, estimation of latent left-handedness, and of subjective complexity of real and imagery movements. The success of brain states recognition during imagination of left hand (LH) movement compared to the rest is higher in reserved, practical, skeptical, and not very sociable individuals. Extraversion, liveliness, and dominance are significant for the imagination of right hand (RH) movements in ""pure"" right-handers, and sensitivity in latent left-handers. Subjective complexity of real LH and of imagery RH movements correlates with the success of brain states recognition in the imagination of movement of LH compared to RH and depends on the level of handedness. Thus, the level of handedness is the factor influencing the success of BCI control. The data are supposed to be connected with hemispheric differences in motor control, lateralization of dopamine, and may be important for rehabilitation of patients after a stroke."
34198435,"Common spatial pattern (CSP) as a spatial filtering method has been most widely applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) feature extraction to classify motor imagery (MI) in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. The effectiveness of CSP is determined by the quality of interception in a specific time window and frequency band. Although numerous algorithms have been designed to optimize CSP by splitting the EEG data with a sliding time window and dividing the frequency bands with a set of band-pass filters, simultaneously. However, they did not consider the drawbacks of the rapid increase in data volume and feature dimensions brought about by this method, which would reduce the classification accuracy and calculation efficiency of the model. Therefore, we propose an optimal channel-based sparse time-frequency blocks common spatial pattern (OCSB-CSP) feature extraction method to improve the model classification accuracy and computational efficiency. Comparative experiments on two public EEG datasets show that the proposed method can quickly select significant time-frequency blocks and improve classification performance. The average classification accuracies are higher than those of other winners' methods, providing a new idea for the improvement of BCI applications."
34180188,"Motor imagery (MI) is an important paradigm of driving brain computer interface (BCI). However, MI is not easy to control or acquire, and the performance of MI-BCI depends heavily on the performance of the subjects' MI. Therefore, the correct execution of MI mental activities, ability evaluation and improvement methods play important and even critical roles in the improvement and application of MI-BCI system's performance. However, in the research and development of MI-BCI, the existing researches mainly focus on the decoding algorithm of MI, but do not pay enough attention to the above three aspects of MI mental activities. In this paper, these problems of MI-BCI are discussed in detail, and it is pointed out that the subjects tend to use visual motor imagery as kinesthetic motor imagery. In the future, we need to develop some objective, quantitatively visualized MI ability evaluation methods, and develop some effective and less time-consumption training methods to improve MI ability. It is also necessary to solve the differences and commonness of MI problems between and within individuals and MI-BCI illiteracy to a certain extent."
34180187,"Motor imaging therapy is of great significance to the rehabilitation of patients with stroke or motor dysfunction, but there are few studies on lower limb motor imagination. When electrical stimulation is applied to the posterior tibial nerve of the ankle, the steady-state somatosensory evoked potentials (SSSEP) can be induced at the electrical stimulation frequency. In order to better realize the classification of lower extremity motor imagination, improve the classification effect, and enrich the instruction set of lower extremity motor imagination, this paper designs two experimental paradigms: Motor imaging (MI) paradigm and Hybrid paradigm. The Hybrid paradigm contains electrical stimulation assistance. Ten healthy college students were recruited to complete the unilateral movement imagination task of left and right foot in two paradigms. Through time-frequency analysis and classification accuracy analysis, it is found that compared with MI paradigm, Hybrid paradigm could get obvious SSSEP and ERD features. The average classification accuracy of subjects in the Hybrid paradigm was 78.61%, which was obviously higher than the MI paradigm. It proves that electrical stimulation has a positive role in promoting the classification training of lower limb motor imagination."
34180186,"The traditional paradigm of motor-imagery-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is abstract, which cannot effectively guide users to modulate brain activity, thus limiting the activation degree of the sensorimotor cortex. It was found that the motor imagery task of Chinese characters writing was better accepted by users and helped guide them to modulate their sensorimotor rhythms. However, different Chinese characters have different writing complexity (number of strokes), and the effect of motor imagery tasks of Chinese characters with different writing complexity on the performance of motor-imagery-based BCI is still unclear. In this paper, a total of 12 healthy subjects were recruited for studying the effects of motor imagery tasks of Chinese characters with two different writing complexity (5 and 10 strokes) on the performance of motor-imagery-based BCI. The experimental results showed that, compared with Chinese characters with 5 strokes, motor imagery task of Chinese characters writing with 10 strokes obtained stronger sensorimotor rhythm and better recognition performance ( <i>P</i> < 0.05). This study indicated that, appropriately increasing the complexity of the motor imagery task of Chinese characters writing can obtain stronger motor imagery potential and improve the recognition accuracy of motor-imagery-based BCI, which provides a reference for the design of the motor-imagery-based BCI paradigm in the future."
34180185,"As the most common active brain-computer interaction paradigm, motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) suffers from the bottleneck problems of small instruction set and low accuracy, and its information transmission rate (ITR) and practical application are severely limited. In this study, we designed 6-class imagination actions, collected electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from 19 subjects, and studied the effect of collaborative brain-computer interface (cBCI) collaboration strategy on MI-BCI classification performance, the effects of changes in different group sizes and fusion strategies on group multi-classification performance are compared. The results showed that the most suitable group size was 4 people, and the best fusion strategy was decision fusion. In this condition, the classification accuracy of the group reached 77%, which was higher than that of the feature fusion strategy under the same group size (77.31% <i>vs.</i> 56.34%), and was significantly higher than that of the average single user (77.31% <i>vs.</i> 44.90%). The research in this paper proves that the cBCI collaboration strategy can effectively improve the MI-BCI classification performance, which lays the foundation for MI-cBCI research and its future application."
34177767,"<b>Objective:</b> Upper limb (UL) motor function recovery, especially distal function, is one of the main goals of stroke rehabilitation as this function is important to perform activities of daily living (ADL). The efficacy of the motor-imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) has been demonstrated in patients with stroke. Most patients with stroke receive comprehensive rehabilitation, including MI-BCI and routine training. However, most aspects of MI-BCI training for patients with subacute stroke are based on routine training. Risk factors for inadequate distal UL functional recovery in these patients remain unclear; therefore, it is more realistic to explore the prognostic factors of this comprehensive treatment based on clinical practice. The present study aims to investigate the independent risk factors that might lead to inadequate distal UL functional recovery in patients with stroke after comprehensive rehabilitation including MI-BCI (CRIMI-BCI). <b>Methods:</b> This prospective study recruited 82 patients with stroke who underwent CRIMI-BCI. Motor-imagery brain-computer interface training was performed for 60 min per day, 5 days per week for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was improvement of the wrist and hand dimensionality of Fugl-Meyer Assessment (δFMA-WH). According to the improvement score, the patients were classified into the efficient group (EG, δFMA-WH > 2) and the inefficient group (IG, δFMA-WH ≤ 2). Binary logistic regression was used to analyze clinical and demographic data, including aphasia, spasticity of the affected hand [assessed by Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS-H)], initial UL function, age, gender, time since stroke (TSS), lesion hemisphere, and lesion location. <b>Results:</b> Seventy-three patients completed the study. After training, all patients showed significant improvement in FMA-UL (Z = 7.381, <i>p</i> = 0.000<sup>**</sup>), FMA-SE (Z = 7.336, <i>p</i> = 0.000<sup>**</sup>), and FMA-WH (Z = 6.568, <i>p</i> = 0.000<sup>**</sup>). There were 35 patients (47.9%) in the IG group and 38 patients (52.1%) in the EG group. Multivariate analysis revealed that presence of aphasia [odds ratio (OR) 4.617, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.435-14.860; <i>p</i> < 0.05], initial FMA-UL score ≤ 30 (OR 5.158, 95% CI 1.150-23.132; <i>p</i> < 0.05), and MAS-H ≥ level I+ (OR 3.810, 95% CI 1.231-11.790; <i>p</i> < 0.05) were the risk factors for inadequate distal UL functional recovery in patients with stroke after CRIMI-BCI. <b>Conclusion:</b> We concluded that CRIMI-BCI improved UL function in stroke patients with varying effectiveness. Inferior initial UL function, significant hand spasticity, and presence of aphasia were identified as independent risk factors for inadequate distal UL functional recovery in stroke patients after CRIMI-BCI."
34176450,"The common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm is one of the most frequently used and effective spatial filtering methods for extracting relevant features for use in motor imagery brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs). However, the inherent defect of the traditional CSP algorithm is that it is highly sensitive to potential outliers, which adversely affects its performance in practical applications. In this work, we propose a novel feature optimization and outlier detection method for the CSP algorithm. Specifically, we use the minimum covariance determinant (MCD) to detect and remove outliers in the dataset, then we use the Fisher score to evaluate and select features. In addition, in order to prevent the emergence of new outliers, we propose an iterative minimum covariance determinant (IMCD) algorithm. We evaluate our proposed algorithm in terms of iteration times, classification accuracy and feature distribution using two BCI competition datasets. The experimental results show that the average classification performance of our proposed method is 12% and 22.9% higher than that of the traditional CSP method in two datasets ([Formula: see text]), and our proposed method obtains better performance in comparison with other competing methods. The results show that our method improves the performance of MI-BCI systems."
34163337,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) has developed rapidly over the past two decades, mainly due to advancements in machine learning. Subjects must learn to modulate their brain activities to ensure a successful BCI. Feedback training is a practical approach to this learning process; however, the commonly used classifier-dependent approaches have inherent limitations such as the need for calibration and a lack of continuous feedback over long periods of time. This paper proposes an online data visualization feedback protocol that intuitively reflects the EEG distribution in Riemannian geometry in real time. Rather than learning a hyperplane, the Riemannian geometry formulation allows iterative learning of prototypical covariance matrices that are translated into visualized feedback through diffusion map process. Ten subjects were recruited for MI-BCI (motor imagery-BCI) training experiments. The subjects learned to modulate their sensorimotor rhythm to centralize the points within one category and to separate points belonging to different categories. The results show favorable overall training effects in terms of the class distinctiveness and EEG feature discriminancy over a 3-day training with 30% learners. A steadily increased class distinctiveness in the last three sessions suggests that the advanced training protocol is effective. The optimal frequency band was consistent during the 3-day training, and the difference between subjects with good or low MI-BCI performance could be clearly observed. We believe that the proposed feedback protocol has promising application prospect."
34162936,"Recent studies show that during a simple movement imagery task, the power of sensorimotor rhythms differs according to handedness. However, the effects of motor imagery perspectives on these differences have not been investigated yet. Our study aimed to check how handedness impacts the activity of alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) oscillations during creating a kinesthetic (KMI) or visual-motor (VMI) representation of movement. Forty subjects (20 right-handed and 20 left-handed) who participated in the experiment were tasked with imagining sequential finger movement from a visual or kinesthetic perspective. Both the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and behavioral correctness of the imagery task performance were measured. After the registration, we used independent component analysis (ICA) on EEG data to localize visual- and motor-related EEG sources of activity shared by both motor imagery conditions. Significant differences were obtained in the visual cortex (the occipital ICs cluster) and the right motor-related area (right parietal ICs cluster). In comparison to right-handers who, regardless of the task, demonstrated the same pattern in the visual area, left-handers obtained higher power in the alpha waves in the VMI task and better performance in this condition. On the other hand, only the right-handed showed different patterns in the alpha waves in the right motor cortex during the KMI condition. The results indicate that left-handers imagine movement differently than right-handers, focusing on visual experience. This provides new empirical evidence on the influence of movement preferences on imagery processes and has possible future implications for research in the area of neurorehabilitation and motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs)."
34147756,"The non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) signals enable humans to communicate with devices and have control over them, this process requires precise classification and identification of those signals. The recent revolution of deep learning has empowered both feature extraction and classification in a joint manner of different data types. However, deep learning is a data learning approach that demands a large number of training samples. Whilst, the EEG research field lacks a large amount of data which restricts the use of deep learning within this field. This paper proposes a novel augmentation method for enlarging EEG datasets. Our CutCat augmentation method generates trials from inter- and intra-subjects and trials. The method relies on cutting a specific period from an EEG trial and concatenating it with a period from another trial from the same subject or different subjects. The method has been tested on shallow and deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the classification of motor imagery (MI) EEG data. Two input formulation types images and time-series have been used as input to the neural networks. Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is used for generating training images from the time-series signals. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed augmentation method is a promising strategy for handling the classification of small-scale datasets. Classification results on two EEG datasets show advancement in comparison with the results of state-of-the-art researches."
34144268,"The Brain-Computer interface system provides a communication path among the brain and computer, and recently, it is the subject of increasing attention. One of the most common paradigms of BCI systems is motor imagery. Currently, to classify motor imagery EEG signals, Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) are extensively used. Generally, the recorded motor imagery EEG signals in BCI are noisy, non-stationary, thus significantly reducing the BCI system's performance. It is shown that the CSP algorithm has a good performance in the classification of various types of motor imagery data. However, once the number of trials is low, or the data are noisy, overfitting will probably occur, which precludes extracting an appropriate spatial filter. Another drawback of the CSP is that it only extracts spatial-based filters. Therefore, the current study attempts to decrease the probability of overfitting in the CSP algorithm by presenting an improved method called Ensemble Regularized Common Spatio-Spectral Pattern (Ensemble RCSSP). Compared with other CSP and improved versions of CSP algorithms, our proposed models indicate a better accuracy, robustness, and reliability for motor imagery EEG data. The performance of the proposed Ensemble RCSSP has been tested for BCI Competition IV, Dataset 1, and BCI Competition III, Dataset Iva. Compared with other methods, performance is improved, and on average, the accuracy for all subjects is reached to 82.64% and 86.91% for the first and second datasets, respectively."
34139268,"Different types of artifacts in the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can considerably reduce the performance of the later-stage EEG analysis algorithms for making decisions, such as those for brain-computer interfacing (BCI) classification. In this paper, we address the problem of artifact detection and removal from single-channel EEG signals. We propose a novel approach that maps the probability of an EEG epoch to be artifactual based on four different statistical measures: entropy (a measure of uncertainty), kurtosis (a measure of peakedness), skewness (a measure of asymmetry), and periodic waveform index (a measure of periodicity). Then, a stationary wavelet transform based artifact removal is proposed that employs a particular probability threshold provided by the user. We have executed our experiments with both synthetic and real EEG data. It is observed that the proposed method exhibits a superior performance for suppressing the artifact contaminated from EEG with minimum distortion. Moreover, evaluation of the algorithm using EEG dataset for BCI experiments reveals that artifact removal can considerably improve the BCI output in both event-related potential and motor-imagery based BCI applications. The proposed algorithm has been applied to both real and synthesized data testing and compared with other state-of-the-art automated artifact removal methods. Its superior performance is verified in terms of various performance metrics including computational complexity for justifying its use in BCI-like real-time applications. Our work is expected to be useful for future research EEG signal processing and eventually to develop more accurate real-time EEG-based BCI applications."
34121989,"Brain activity is composed of oscillatory and broadband arrhythmic components; however, there is more focus on oscillatory sensorimotor rhythms to study movement, but temporal dynamics of broadband arrhythmic electroencephalography (EEG) remain unexplored. We have previously demonstrated that broadband arrhythmic EEG contains both short- and long-range temporal correlations that change significantly during movement. In this study, we build upon our previous work to gain a deeper understanding of these changes in the long-range temporal correlation (LRTC) in broadband EEG and contrast them with the well-known LRTC in alpha oscillation amplitude typically found in the literature. We investigate and validate changes in LRTCs during five different types of movements and motor imagery tasks using two independent EEG datasets recorded with two different paradigms-our finger tapping dataset with single self-initiated asynchronous finger taps and publicly available EEG dataset containing cued continuous movement and motor imagery of fists and feet. We quantified instantaneous changes in broadband LRTCs by detrended fluctuation analysis on single trial 2 s EEG sliding windows. The broadband LRTC increased significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) during all motor tasks as compared to the resting state. In contrast, the alpha oscillation LRTC, which had to be computed on longer stitched EEG segments, decreased significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) consistently with the literature. This suggests the complementarity of underlying fast and slow neuronal scale-free dynamics during movement and motor imagery. The single trial broadband LRTC gave high average binary classification accuracy in the range of 70.54±10.03% to 76.07±6.40% for all motor execution and imagery tasks and hence can be used in brain-computer interface (BCI). Thus, we demonstrate generalizability, robustness, and reproducibility of novel motor neural correlate, the single trial broadband LRTC, during different motor execution and imagery tasks in single asynchronous and cued continuous motor-BCI paradigms and its contrasting behavior with LRTC in alpha oscillation amplitude."
34115589,"In the last decade, functional connectivity (FC) has been increasingly adopted based on its ability to capture statistical dependencies between multivariate brain signals. However, the role of FC in the context of brain-computer interface applications is still poorly understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we considered a group of 20 healthy subjects during an EEG-based hand motor imagery (MI) task. We studied two well-established FC estimators, i.e. spectral- and imaginary-coherence, and we investigated how they were modulated by the MI task. We characterized the resulting FC networks by extracting the strength of connectivity of each EEG sensor and we compared the discriminant power with respect to standard power spectrum features. At the group level, results showed that while spectral-coherence based network features were increasing in the sensorimotor areas, those based on imaginary-coherence were significantly decreasing. We demonstrated that this opposite, but complementary, behavior was respectively determined by the increase in amplitude and phase synchronization between the brain signals. At the individual level, we eventually assessed the potential of these network connectivity features in a simple off-line classification scenario. Taken together, our results provide fresh insights into the oscillatory mechanisms subserving brain network changes during MI and offer new perspectives to improve BCI performance."
34111849,"Non-invasive multichannel Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings provide an alternative source of neural information from which motor imagery (MI) patterns associated with limb movement intent can be decoded for use as control inputs for rehabilitation robots. The presence of multiple inherent dynamic artifacts in EEG signals, however, poses processing challenges for brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. A large proportion of the existing EEG signal preprocessing methods focus on isolating single artifact per time from an ensemble of EEG trials and require calibration and/or reference electrodes, resulting in increased complexity of their application to MI-EEG controlled rehabilitation devices in practical settings. Also, a few existing multi-artifacts removal methods though explored in other domains, they have rarely been investigated in the space of MI-EEG signals for multiple artifacts cancellation in a simultaneous manner. Building on the premise of previous works, this study propose a semi-automatic EEG preprocessing method that combines Generalized Eigenvalue Decomposition driven by low-rank approximation and a Multi-channel Wiener Filter (GEVD-MWF) that employs a learning technique for simultaneous elimination of multiple artifacts from MI-EEG signals. The proposed method is applied to remove multiple artifacts from 64-channel EEG signals recorded from transhumeral amputees while they performed distinct classes of upper limb MI tasks before decoding their movement intent using a selection of features and machine learning algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed GEVD-MWF method yields significant improvements in MI decoding accuracies, in the range of 13.23%-41.21% compared to four existing popular artifact removal algorithms. Further investigation revealed that the GEVD-MWF approach enabled accuracies in the range of 90.44% - 99.67% using ""single trial"" EEG recordings, which could eliminate the need to record and process large ensembles of EEG trials as commonly required in some existing approaches. Additionally, using a variant of the sequential forward floating selection algorithm, a subset of 9 channels was used to obtain a decoding accuracy of 93.73%±1.58%. Given its improved performance, reduced data requirements, and feasibility with few channels, the proposed GEVD-MWF could potentially spur the development of effective real-time control strategies for multi-degree of freedom EEG-based miniaturized rehabilitation robotic interfaces."
34101595,"In stroke rehabilitation, motor imagery based on a brain-computer interface is an extremely useful method to control an external device and utilize neurofeedback. Many studies have reported on the classification performance of motor imagery to decode individual fingers in stroke patients compared with healthy controls. However, classification performance for a given limb is still low because the differences between patients owing to brain reorganization after stroke are not considered. We used electroencephalography signals from eleven healthy controls and eleven stroke patients in this study. The subjects performed a finger tapping task during motor execution, and motor imagery was performed with the dominant and affected hands in the healthy controls and stroke patients, respectively. All fingers except for the thumb were classified using the proposed framework based on a voting module. The averaged four-class accuracies during motor execution and motor imagery were 53.16 ± 8.42% and 46.94 ± 5.99% for the healthy controls and 53.17 ± 14.09% and 66.00 ± 14.96% for the stroke patients, respectively. Importantly, the classification accuracies in the stroke patients were statistically higher than those in healthy controls during motor imagery. However, there was no significant difference between the accuracies of motor execution and motor imagery. These findings show the potential for high classification performance for a given limb during motor imagery in stroke patients. These results can also provide insights into controlling an external device on the basis of a brain-computer interface."
34082405,"<i>Objective</i>. Brain decoding of motor imagery (MI) not only is crucial for the control of neuroprosthesis but also provides insights into the underlying neural mechanisms. Walking consists of stance and swing phases, which are associated with different biomechanical and neural control features. However, previous knowledge on decoding the MI of gait is limited to simple information (e.g. the classification of 'walking' and 'rest').<i>Approach</i>. Here, we investigated the feasibility of electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding of the two gait phases during the MI of walking and whether the combined use of MI and action observation (AO) would improve decoding accuracy.<i>Main results</i>. We demonstrated that the stance and swing phases could be decoded from EEGs during MI or AO alone. We also demonstrated the decoding accuracy during MI was improved by concurrent AO. The decoding models indicated that the improved decoding accuracy following the combined use of MI and AO was facilitated by the additional information resulting from the concurrent cortical activations related to sensorimotor, visual, and action understanding systems associated with MI and AO.<i>Significance</i>. This study is the first to show that decoding the stance versus swing phases during MI is feasible. The current findings provide fundamental knowledge for neuroprosthetic design and gait rehabilitation, and they expand our understanding of the neural activity underlying AO, MI, and AO + MI of walking.<b>Novelty and significance</b>Brain decoding of detailed gait-related information during motor imagery (MI) is important for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for gait rehabilitation. This study is the first to show the feasibility of EEG decoding of the stance versus swing phases during MI. We also demonstrated that the combined use of MI and action observation (AO) improves decoding accuracy, which is facilitated by the concurrent and synergistic involvement of the cortical activations for MI and AO. These findings extend the current understanding of neural activity and the combined effects of AO and MI and provide a basis for effective techniques for walking rehabilitation."
34078274,"Brain wave signal recognition has gained increased attention in neuro-rehabilitation applications. This has driven the development of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Brain wave signals are acquired using electroencephalography (EEG) sensors, processed and decoded to identify the category to which the signal belongs. Once the signal category is determined, it can be used to control external devices. However, the success of such a system essentially relies on significant feature extraction and classification algorithms. One of the commonly used feature extraction technique for BCI systems is common spatial pattern (CSP). The performance of the proposed spatial-frequency-temporal feature extraction (SPECTRA) predictor is analysed using three public benchmark datasets. Our proposed predictor outperformed other competing methods achieving lowest average error rates of 8.55%, 17.90% and 20.26%, and highest average kappa coefficient values of 0.829, 0.643 and 0.595 for BCI Competition III dataset IVa, BCI Competition IV dataset I and BCI Competition IV dataset IIb, respectively. Our proposed SPECTRA predictor effectively finds features that are more separable and shows improvement in brain wave signal recognition that can be instrumental in developing improved real-time BCI systems that are computationally efficient."
34077914,"<i>Objective</i>. With the development of clinical applications of motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs), a single-channel MI-BCI system that can be easily assembled is an attractive goal. However, due to the low quality of the spectral power features in the traditional MI-BCI paradigm, the recognition performance of current single-channel systems is far lower than that of multi-channel systems, impeding their use in clinical applications.<i>Approach.</i>In this study, the subjects' right and left hands were stimulated simultaneously at different frequencies to induce steady-state somatosensory evoked potentials (SSSEP). Subjects then performed motor imagery (MI) tasks. A new electroencephalography (EEG) index, inter-stimulus phase coherence (ISPC), was built to measure phase desynchronization of SSSEP caused by MI. Then, ISPC is introduced as a feature into left-hand and right-hand MI recognition.<i>Main results.</i>ISPC analysis found that left-handed MI can cause a significant decrease in phase synchronization in contralateral sensorimotor SSSEP, while right-handed MI has little effect on it, and vice versa. Combining ISPC features with traditional spectral power features, the single-channel left-hand versus right-hand MI recognition accuracy reaches 81.0%, which is much higher than that observed with traditional MI paradigms (about 60%).<i>Significance.</i>This work shows that the hybrid MI-SSSEP paradigm can provide more sensitive EEG features to decode motor intentions, demonstrating its potential for clinical applications."
34039029,"Perinatal stroke is the leading cause of hemiparetic cerebral palsy resulting in lifelong disability for millions of people worldwide. Options for motor rehabilitation are limited, especially for the most severely affected children. Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) sample brain activity to allow users to control external devices. Functional electrical stimulation enhances motor recovery after stroke, and BCI-activated functional electrical stimulation was recently shown to improve upper extremity function in adult stroke. We aimed to determine the ability of children with perinatal stroke to operate a simple BCI. Twenty-one children with magnetic resonance imaging–confirmed perinatal stroke (57% male, mean [SD] 13.5 [2.6] years, range 9–18) were compared with 24 typically developing controls (71% male, mean age [SD] 13.7 [3.7] years, range 6–18). Participants trained on a simple EEG-based BCI over 2 sessions (10 trials each) utilizing 2 different mental imagery strategies: (1) motor imagery (imagine opening and closing of hands) and (2) goal oriented (imagine effector object moving toward target) to complete 2 tasks: (1) drive a remote controlled car to a target and (2) move a computer cursor to a target. Primary outcome was Cohen Kappa with a score >0.40 suggesting BCI competence. BCI performance was comparable between stroke and control participants. Mean scores were 0.39 (0.18) for stroke versus 0.42 (0.18) for controls (t[42]=0.478, P=0.94). No difference in performance between venous (M=0.45, SD=0.29) and arterial (M=0.34, SD=0.22) stroke (t[82]=1.89, P=0.090) was observed. No effect of task or strategy was observed in the stroke participants. Over 90% of stroke participants demonstrated competency on at least one of the 4 task-strategy combinations. Children with perinatal stroke can achieve proficiency in basic tasks using simple BCI systems. Future directions include exploration of BCI-functional electrical stimulation systems for rehabilitation for children with hemiparesis and other forms of cerebral palsy."

Prior work has suggested that EEG motor imagery based BCI can benefit from increased decoding accuracy through the application of deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).<i>Approach</i>. Here, we examine whether these improvements can generalize to practical scenarios such as continuous control tasks (as opposed to prior work reporting one classification per trial), whether valuable information remains latent outside of the motor cortex (as no prior work has compared full scalp coverage to motor only electrode montages), and the existing challenges to the practical implementation of deep-learning based continuous BCI control.<i>Main results</i>. We report that: (1) deep learning methods significantly increase offline performance compared to standard methods on an independent, large, and longitudinal online motor imagery BCI dataset with up to 4-classes and continuous 2D feedback; (2) our results suggest that a variety of neural biomarkers for BCI, including those outside the motor cortex, can be detected and used to improve performance through deep learning methods, and (3) tuning neural network output will be an important step in optimizing online BCI control, as we found the CNN models trained with full scalp EEG also significantly reduce the average trial length in a simulated online cursor control environment.<i>Significance</i>. This work demonstrates the benefits of CNNs classification during BCI control while providing evidence that electrode montage selection and the mapping of CNN output to device control will be important design choices in CNN based BCIs."
34038871,"<i>Objective.</i>Many electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems use a large amount of channels for higher performance, which is time-consuming to set up and inconvenient for practical applications. Finding an optimal subset of channels without compromising the performance is a necessary and challenging task.<i>Approach.</i>In this article, we proposed a cross-correlation based discriminant criterion (XCDC) which assesses the importance of a channel for discriminating the mental states of different motor imagery (MI) tasks. Channels are ranked and selected according to the proposed criterion. The efficacy of XCDC is evaluated on two MI EEG datasets.<i>Main results.</i>On the two datasets, the proposed method reduces the channel number from 71 and 15 to under 18 and 11 respectively without compromising the classification accuracy on unseen data. Under the same constraint of accuracy, the proposed method requires fewer channels than existing channel selection methods based on Pearson's correlation coefficient and common spatial pattern. Visualization of XCDC shows consistent results with neurophysiological principles.<i>Significance.</i>This work proposes a quantitative criterion for assessing and ranking the importance of EEG channels in MI tasks and provides a practical method for selecting the ranked channels in the calibration phase of MI BCI systems, which alleviates the computational complexity and configuration difficulty in the subsequent steps, leading to real-time and more convenient BCI systems."
34034032,"In the brain computer interface (BCI) field, using sub-band common spatial pattern (SBCSP) and filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) can improve the accuracy of classification by selection a specific frequency band. However, in the cross-subject classification, due to the individual differences between different subjects, the performance is limited. This paper introduces the idea of transfer learning and presents the sub-band target alignment common spatial pattern (SBTACSP) method and applies it to the cross-subject classification of motor imagery (MI) EEG signals. First, the EEG signals are bandpass-filtered into multiple frequency bands (sub-band filtering). Subsequently, the source domain trails are aligned into the target domain space in each frequency band. The CSP algorithm is then employed to extract features among which more representative features are selected by the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) approach from each sub-band. Then the features of all sub-bands are fused. Finally, conventional linear discriminant analysis (LDA) algorithm is used for MI classification. Our method is evaluated on Datasets Ⅱa and Ⅱb of the BCI Competition Ⅳ. Compared with six state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed SBTACSP method performed relatively the best and achieved a mean classification accuracy of 75.15% and 66.85% in cross-subject classification of Datasets Ⅱa and Ⅱb respectively. Therefore, the combination of sub-band filtering and transfer learning achieves superior classification performance compared to either one. The proposed algorithms will greatly promote the practical application of MI based BCIs."
34033571,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies are popular methods of communication between the human brain and external devices. One of the most popular approaches to BCI is motor imagery (MI). In BCI applications, the electroencephalography (EEG) is a very popular measurement for brain dynamics because of its noninvasive nature. Although there is a high interest in the BCI topic, the performance of existing systems is still far from ideal, due to the difficulty of performing pattern recognition tasks in EEG signals. This difficulty lies in the selection of the correct EEG channels, the signal-to-noise ratio of these signals, and how to discern the redundant information among them. BCI systems are composed of a wide range of components that perform signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and decision making. In this article, we define a new BCI framework, called enhanced fusion framework, where we propose three different ideas to improve the existing MI-based BCI frameworks. First, we include an additional preprocessing step of the signal: a differentiation of the EEG signal that makes it time invariant. Second, we add an additional frequency band as a feature for the system: the sensorimotor rhythm band, and we show its effect on the performance of the system. Finally, we make a profound study of how to make the final decision in the system. We propose the usage of both up to six types of different classifiers and a wide range of aggregation functions (including classical aggregations, Choquet and Sugeno integrals, and their extensions and overlap functions) to fuse the information given by the considered classifiers. We have tested this new system on a dataset of 20 volunteers performing MI-based brain-computer interface experiments. On this dataset, the new system achieved 88.80% accuracy. We also propose an optimized version of our system that is able to obtain up to 90.76%. Furthermore, we find that the pair Choquet/Sugeno integrals and overlap functions are the ones providing the best results."
34031436,"Motor Imagery is a classical method of Brain Computer Interaction, in which electroencephalogram (EEG) signal features evoked by the imaginary body movements are recognized, and relevant information is extracted. Recently, various deep learning methods are being focused on finding an easy-to-use EEG representation method that can preserve both temporal information as well as spatial information. To further utilize the spatial and temporal features of EEG signals, we proposed a 3D representation of EEG and an end-to-end EEG three-branch 3D convolutional neural network, to address the class imbalance problem (dataset show unequal distribution among their classes), we proposed a class balance cropped strategy. Experimental results indicated that there are also a problem of the different classification difficulty for different classes in motor stages classification tasks, we introduce focal loss to address problem of 'easy-hard' examples, when trained with the focal loss, the three-branch 3D-CNN network achieve good performance (relatively more balanced classification accuracy of binary classifications) on the WAY-EEG-GAL data set. Experimental results show that the proposed method is a good method, which can improve classification effect of different motor stages classification."
34028306,Motor attempt (MA)/motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is a newly developing rehabilitation technology for motor impairment. This study aims to explore the relationship between electroencephalography sensorimotor rhythm and motor impairment to provide reference for a BCI design. Twenty-eight stroke survivors with varying levels of motor dysfunction and spasticity status in the subacute or chronic stage were enrolled in the study to perform MA and MI tasks. Event-related desynchronization (ERD)/event-related synchronization (ERS) during and immediately after motor tasks were calculated. The Fugl-Meyer assessment scale (FMA) and the modified Ashworth scale (MAS) were applied to characterize upper-limb motor dysfunction and spasticity. There was a positive correlation between FMA total scores and ERS in the contralesional hemisphere in the MI task (<i>P </i>< .05) and negative correlations between FMA total scores and ERD in both hemispheres in the MA task (<i>P </i>< .05). Negative correlations were found between MAS scores of wrist flexors and ERD in the ipsilesional hemisphere (<i>P </i>< .05) in the MA task. It suggests that motor dysfunction may be more correlated to ERS in the MI task and to ERD in the MA task while spasticity may be more correlated to ERD in the MA task.
34025347,"The brain is the central nervous system that governs human activities. However, in modern society, more and more diseases threaten the health of the brain and nerves and spinal cord, making the human brain unable to conduct normal information interaction with the outside world. The rehabilitation training of the brain-computer interface can promote the nerve repair of the sensorimotor cortex in patients with brain diseases. Therefore, the research of brain-computer interface for motor imaging is of great significance for patients with brain diseases to restore motor function. Due to the characteristics of non-stationary, nonlinear, and individual differences of EEG signals, there are still many difficulties in the analysis and classification of EEG signals at this stage. In this study, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model was used to classify motor-imaging EEG signals, identify the user's intention, and control external devices. Considering that single-modal features cannot represent the core information, this study uses a fusion feature that combines temporal and spatial features as the final feature data. The fusion features are input to the trained ELM classifier, and the final classification result is obtained. Two sets of BCI competition data in the BCI competition public database are used to verify the validity of the model. The experimental results show that the ELM model has achieved a classification accuracy of 0.7832 in the classification task of Data Sets IIb, which is higher than other comparison algorithms, and shows universal applicability among different subjects. In addition, the average recognition rate of this model in the Data Sets IIIa classification task reaches 0.8347, which has obvious advantages compared with the comparative classification algorithm. The classification effect is smaller than the classification effect obtained by the champion algorithm of the same project, which has certain reference value."
33945075,"Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain computer interface (BCI) enables people to interact directly with computing devices through their brain signals. A BCI typically interprets EEG signals to reflect the user's intent or other mental activity. Motor imagery (MI) is a commonly used technique in BCIs where a user is asked to imagine moving certain part of the body such as a hand or a foot. By correctly interpreting the signal, one can perform a multitude of tasks such as controlling wheel chair, playing computer games, or even typing text. However, the use of motor-imagery-based BCIs outside the laboratory environment is limited due to the lack of their reliability. This work focuses on another kind of mental imagery, namely, the visual imagery (VI). VI is the manipulation of visual information that comes from memory. This work presents a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based system for the recognition of visual/mental imagination of English alphabets so as to enable typing directly via brain signals. The DCNN learns to extract the spatial features hidden in the EEG signal. As opposed to many deep neural networks that use raw EEG signals for classification, this work transforms the raw signals into band powers using Morlet wavelet transformation. The proposed approach is evaluated on two publicly available benchmark MI-EEG datasets and a visual imagery dataset specifically collected for this work. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed model performs better than the existing state-of-the-art methods for MI-EEG classification and yields an average accuracy of 99.45% on the two public MI-EEG datasets. The model also achieves an average recognition rate of 95.2% for the 26 English-language alphabets. Overall working of the proposed solution for imagined character recognition through EEG signals."
33927204,"Recent advancements in magnetoencephalography (MEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have shown great potential. However, the performance of current MEG-BCI systems is still inadequate and one of the main reasons for this is the unavailability of open-source MEG-BCI datasets. MEG systems are expensive and hence MEG datasets are not readily available for researchers to develop effective and efficient BCI-related signal processing algorithms. In this work, we release a 306-channel MEG-BCI data recorded at 1KHz sampling frequency during four mental imagery tasks (i.e. hand imagery, feet imagery, subtraction imagery, and word generation imagery). The dataset contains two sessions of MEG recordings performed on separate days from 17 healthy participants using a typical BCI imagery paradigm. The current dataset will be the only publicly available MEG imagery BCI dataset as per our knowledge. The dataset can be used by the scientific community towards the development of novel pattern recognition machine learning methods to detect brain activities related to motor imagery and cognitive imagery tasks using MEG signals."
33913351,"<i>Background</i>. A number of recent randomized controlled trials reported the efficacy of brain-computer interface (BCI) for upper-limb stroke rehabilitation compared with other therapies. Despite the encouraging results reported, there is a significant variance in the reported outcomes. This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of different BCI designs on poststroke upper-limb rehabilitation. <i>Methods.</i> The effect sizes of pooled and individual studies were assessed by computing Hedge's <i>g</i> values with a 95% confidence interval. Subgroup analyses were also performed to examine the impact of different BCI designs on the treatment effect. <i>Results.</i> The study included 12 clinical trials involving 298 patients. The analysis showed that the BCI yielded significant superior short-term and long-term efficacy in improving the upper-limb motor function compared to the control therapies (Hedge's <i>g</i> = 0.73 and 0.33, respectively). Based on our subgroup analyses, the BCI studies that used the intention of movement had a higher effect size compared to those used motor imagery (Hedge's <i>g</i> = 1.21 and 0.55, respectively). The BCI studies using band power features had a significantly higher effect size than those using filter bank common spatial patterns features (Hedge's <i>g</i> = 1.25 and - 0.23, respectively). Finally, the studies that used functional electrical stimulation as the BCI feedback had the highest effect size compared to other devices (Hedge's <i>g</i> = 1.2). <i>Conclusion.</i> This meta-analysis confirmed the effectiveness of BCI for upper-limb rehabilitation. Our findings support the use of band power features, the intention of movement, and the functional electrical stimulation in future BCI designs for poststroke upper-limb rehabilitation."
33909193,"Nowadays, the brain-computer interface (BCI) systems attract much more attention than before, yet they have not found their ways into our lives since their accuracy is not satisfying. Error Related Potential (ErRP) is a potential that occurs in human brain signals when an unintended event happens, against ones' will and thoughts. An example is the occurrence of an error in BCI systems. Investigation of the ErRP could enable researchers to increase the accuracy of BCI systems by detecting instances of inaccuracy in the system. In this research the effects of two parameters on the ErRP are studied: (1) The Motor Imagery Time, also known as Inter-Stimulus Interval (ISI) and (2) different types of feedback (Visual and Tactile). The statistical analysis of the ErRP characteristics showed that feedback type meaningfully affects the ErRP in a cue-paced BCI system and it will affect the time of occurrence of this potential. To validate the proposed idea, different feature extraction, and classification techniques were used for the classification of the BCI system responses. It was shown that by proper selection of the parameters and features, the accuracy of the system could be improved. Tactile feedback together with higher ISI could increase the accuracy of finding erroneous trials up to 90%. The proposed method's accuracy was significantly higher (p-value < 0.05) compared to other methods of feature extraction."
33899422,"With the advantage of providing more natural and flexible control manner, brain-computer interface systems based on motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) have been widely used in the field of human-machine interaction. However, due to the lower signal-noise ratio and poor spatial resolution of EEG signals, the decoding accuracy is relative low. To solve this problem, a novel convolutional neural network based on temporal-spatial feature learning (TSCNN) was proposed for motor imagery EEG decoding. Firstly, for the EEG signals preprocessed by band-pass filtering, a temporal-wise convolution layer and a spatial-wise convolution layer were respectively designed, and temporal-spatial features of motor imagery EEG were constructed. Then, 2-layer two-dimensional convolutional structures were adopted to learn abstract features from the raw temporal-spatial features. Finally, the softmax layer combined with the fully connected layer were used to perform decoding task from the extracted abstract features. The experimental results of the proposed method on the open dataset showed that the average decoding accuracy was 80.09%, which is approximately 13.75% and 10.99% higher than that of the state-of-the-art common spatial pattern (CSP) + support vector machine (SVM) and filter bank CSP (FBCSP) + SVM recognition methods, respectively. This demonstrates that the proposed method can significantly improve the reliability of motor imagery EEG decoding."
33889080,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are communication bridges between a human brain and external world, enabling humans to interact with their environment without muscle intervention. Their functionality, therefore, depends on both the BCI system and the cognitive capacities of the user. Motor-imagery BCIs (MI-BCI) rely on the users' mental imagination of body movements. However, not all users have the ability to sufficiently modulate their brain activity for control of a MI-BCI; a problem known as BCI illiteracy or inefficiency. The underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and the cause of such difference among users is yet not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the impact of several cognitive and psychological measures on MI-BCI performance. Fifty-five novice BCI-users participated in a left- versus right-hand motor imagery task. In addition to their BCI classification error rate and demographics, psychological measures including personality factors, affinity for technology, and motivation during the experiment, as well as cognitive measures including visuospatial memory and spatial ability and Vividness of Visual Imagery were collected. Factors that were found to have a significant impact on MI-BCI performance were Vividness of Visual Imagery, and the personality factors of orderliness and autonomy. These findings shed light on individual traits that lead to difficulty in BCI operation and hence can help with early prediction of inefficiency among users to optimize training for them."
33887382,"Corticospinal excitability in humans can be facilitated during imagination and/or observation of upper-limb motor tasks. However, it remains unclear to what extent facilitation levels may differ from those elicited during execution of the same tasks. Twelve able-bodied individuals were recruited in this study. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscles were elicited through transcranial magnetic stimulation of the primary motor cortex during: (i) rest; (ii) wrist extension; and (iii) wrist flexion. Responses were compared between: (1) motor imagery combined with virtual action observation (MI + AO; first-person virtual wrist movements shown on a computer display, while participants remained at rest and imagined these movements); and (2) motor execution (ME; participants extended or flexed their wrist). During MI + AO, ECR MEPs were facilitated during the extension phase but not the flexion phase, while FCR MEPs were facilitated during the flexion phase but not extension phase, compared to rest. During the ME condition, same, but greater, modulations were shown as those during MI + AO, while background muscle activities were similar in the rest phase as during extension and flexion phase in the MI + AO condition. Our results demonstrated that kinesthetic MI that included imagination and observation of virtual hands can elicit phase-dependent muscles-specific corticospinal facilitation of wrist muscles, consistent to those during actual hand extension and flexion. Moreover, we showed that MI + AO can contribute considerably to the overall corticospinal facilitation (∼20 % of ME) even without muscle contractions. These findings support utility of computer graphics-based motor imagery, which may have implications for rehabilitation and development of brain-computer interfaces."
33875691,"Stroke leads to both regional brain functional disruptions and network reorganization. However, how brain functional networks reconfigure as task demand increases in stroke patients and whether such reorganization at baseline would facilitate post-stroke motor recovery are largely unknown. To address this gap, brain functional connectivity (FC) were examined at rest and motor tasks in eighteen chronic subcortical stroke patients and eleven age-matched healthy controls. Stroke patients underwent a 2-week intervention using a motor imagery-assisted brain computer interface-based (MI-BCI) training with or without transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Motor recovery was determined by calculating the changes of the upper extremity component of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) score between pre- and post-intervention divided by the pre-intervention FMA score. The results suggested that as task demand increased (i.e., from resting to passive unaffected hand gripping and to active affected hand gripping), patients showed greater FC disruptions in cognitive networks including the default and dorsal attention networks. Compared to controls, patients had lower task-related spatial similarity in the somatomotor-subcortical, default-somatomotor, salience/ventral attention-subcortical and subcortical-subcortical connections, suggesting greater inefficiency in motor execution. Importantly, higher baseline network-specific FC strength (e.g., dorsal attention and somatomotor) and more efficient brain network reconfigurations (e.g., somatomotor and subcortical) from rest to active affected hand gripping at baseline were related to better future motor recovery. Our findings underscore the importance of studying functional network reorganization during task-free and task conditions for motor recovery prediction in stroke."
33867928,"With the advent of advanced machine learning methods, the performance of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) has improved unprecedentedly. However, electroencephalography (EEG), a commonly used brain imaging method for BCI, is characterized by a tedious experimental setup, frequent data loss due to artifacts, and is time consuming for bulk trial recordings to take advantage of the capabilities of deep learning classifiers. Some studies have tried to address this issue by generating artificial EEG signals. However, a few of these methods are limited in retaining the prominent features or biomarker of the signal. And, other deep learning-based generative methods require a huge number of samples for training, and a majority of these models can handle data augmentation of one category or class of data at any training session. Therefore, there exists a necessity for a generative model that can generate synthetic EEG samples with as few available trials as possible and generate multi-class while retaining the biomarker of the signal. Since EEG signal represents an accumulation of action potentials from neuronal populations beneath the scalp surface and as spiking neural network (SNN), a biologically closer artificial neural network, communicates via spiking behavior, we propose an SNN-based approach using surrogate-gradient descent learning to reconstruct and generate multi-class artificial EEG signals from just a few original samples. The network was employed for augmenting motor imagery (MI) and steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) data. These artificial data are further validated through classification and correlation metrics to assess its resemblance with original data and in-turn enhanced the MI classification performance."
33862607,"<i>Objective.</i>The electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been used in the control of robotic arms. The performance of non-invasive BCIs may not be satisfactory due to the poor quality of EEG signals, so the shared control strategies were tried as an alternative solution. However, most of the existing shared control methods set the arbitration rules manually, which highly depended on the specific tasks and developer's experience. In this study, we proposed a novel shared control model that automatically optimized the control commands in a dynamical way based on the context in real-time control. Besides, we employed the hybrid BCI to better allocate commands with multiple functions. The system allowed non-invasive BCI users to manipulate a robotic arm moving in a three-dimensional (3D) space and complete a pick-place task of multiple objects.<i>Approach.</i>Taking the scene information obtained by computer vision as a knowledge base, a machine agent was designed to infer the user's intention and generate automatic commands. Based on the inference confidence and user's characteristic, the proposed shared control model fused the machine autonomy and human intention dynamically for robotic arm motion optimization during the online control. In addition, we introduced a hybrid BCI scheme that applied steady-state visual evoked potentials and motor imagery to the divided primary and secondary BCI interfaces to better allocate the BCI resources (e.g. decoding computing power, screen occupation) and realize the multi-dimensional control of the robotic arm.<i>Main results.</i>Eleven subjects participated in the online experiments of picking and placing five objects that scattered at different positions in a 3D workspace. The results showed that most of the subjects could control the robotic arm to complete accurate and robust picking task with an average success rate of approximately 85% under the shared control strategy, while the average success rate of placing task controlled by pure BCI was 50% approximately.<i>Significance.</i>In this paper, we proposed a novel shared controller for motion automatic optimization, together with a hybrid BCI control scheme that allocated paradigms according to the importance of commands to realize multi-dimensional and effective control of a robotic arm. Our study indicated that the shared control strategy with hybrid BCI could greatly improve the performance of the brain-actuated robotic arm system."
33847221,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) is getting increasing attention where classification of motor imagery (MI) using electroencephalography (EEG) signal plays a vital role. In traditional EEG-based BCI setup, after applying pre-processing like band-pass filtering and spatial filtering, features are extracted and are fed to the classifier. However, most of the traditional features are extracted from a single time window, which is usually the full-time frame of a cue-based MI signal. Such features are usually statistical characteristics like log-variance of the whole-time signal. Thus, the information, which is localised in time and crucial for subject-specific MI classification, is not best captured. In this work, a new time-localised approach is proposed where multiple time windows are used for feature extraction. We have developed a number of feature representations using those time windows. Our experimental results corroborate that the proposed approach can achieve higher accuracy of classification when compared to methods using conventional features using the same platform."
33841120,"In a Mental Imagery Brain-Computer Interface the user has to perform a specific mental task that generates electroencephalography (EEG) components, which can be translated in commands to control a BCI system.

33836516,"<i>Objective</i>. Motor imagery electroencephalography (MI-EEG) produces one of the most commonly used biosignals in intelligent rehabilitation systems. The newly developed 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN) is gaining increasing attention for its ability to recognize MI tasks. The key to successful identification of movement intention is dependent on whether the data representation can faithfully reflect the cortical activity induced by MI. However, the present data representation, which is often generated from partial source signals with time-frequency analysis, contains incomplete information. Therefore, it would be beneficial to explore a new type of data representation using raw spatiotemporal dipole information as well as the possible development of a matching 3DCNN.<i>Approach.</i>Based on EEG source imaging and 3DCNN, a novel decoding method for identifying MI tasks is proposed, called ESICNND. MI-EEG is mapped to the cerebral cortex by the standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography algorithm, and the optimal sampling points of the dipoles are selected as the time of interest to best reveal the difference between any two MI tasks. Then, the initial subject coordinate system is converted to a magnetic resonance imaging coordinate system, followed by dipole interpolation and volume down-sampling; the resulting 3D dipole amplitude matrices are merged at the selected sampling points to obtain 4D dipole feature matrices (4DDFMs). These matrices are augmented by sliding window technology and input into a 3DCNN with a cascading architecture of three modules (3M3DCNN) to perform the extraction and classification of comprehensive features.<i>Main results.</i>Experiments are carried out on two public datasets; the average ten-fold CV classification accuracies reach 88.73% and 96.25%, respectively, and the statistical analysis demonstrates outstanding consistency and stability.<i>Significance.</i>The 4DDFMs reveals the variation of cortical activation in a 3D spatial cube with a temporal dimension and matches the 3M3DCNN well, making full use of the high-resolution spatiotemporal information from all dipoles."
33828507,"This study explored the effect of kinesthetic motor imagery training on reaching-to-grasp movement supplemented by a virtual environment in a patient with congenital bilateral transverse upper-limb deficiency. Based on a theoretical assumption, it is possible to conduct such training in this patient. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether cortical activity related to motor imagery of reaching and motor imagery of grasping of the right upper limb was changed by computer-aided imagery training (CAIT) in a patient who was born without upper limbs compared to a healthy control subject, as characterized by multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded before and 4, 8, and 12 weeks after CAIT. The main task during CAIT was to kinesthetically imagine the execution of reaching-to-grasp movements without any muscle activation, supplemented by computer visualization of movements provided by a special headset. Our experiment showed that CAIT can be conducted in the patient with higher vividness of imagery for reaching than grasping tasks. Our results confirm that CAIT can change brain activation patterns in areas related to motor planning and the execution of reaching and grasping movements, and that the effect was more pronounced in the patient than in the healthy control subject. The results show that CAIT has a different effect on the cortical activity related to the motor imagery of a reaching task than on the cortical activity related to the motor imagery of a grasping task. The change observed in the activation patterns could indicate CAIT-induced neuroplasticity, which could potentially be useful in rehabilitation or brain-computer interface purposes for such patients, especially before and after transplantation.

33823492,"<i>Objective.</i>Error-related potentials (ErrPs) are spontaneous electroencephalogram signals related to the awareness of erroneous responses within brain domain. ErrPs-based correction mechanisms can be applied to motor imagery-brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) to prevent incorrect actions and ultimately improve the performance of the hybrid BCI. Many studies on ErrPs detection are mostly conducted under offline conditions with poor classification accuracy and the error rates of ErrPs are preset in advance, which is too ideal to apply in realistic applications. In order to solve these problems, a novel method based on adaptive autoregressive (AAR) model and common spatial pattern (CSP) is proposed for ErrPs feature extraction. In addition, an adaptive threshold classification method based spectral regression discriminant analysis (SRDA) is suggested for class-unbalanced ErrPs data to reduce the false positives and false negatives.<i>Approach.</i>As for ErrPs feature extraction, the AAR coefficients in the temporal domain and CSP in the spatial domain are fused. Given that the performance of different subjects' MI tasks is different but stable, and the samples of ErrPs are class-imbalanced, an adaptive threshold based SRDA is suggested for classification. Two datasets are used in this paper. The open public clinical neuroprosthetics and brain interaction (CNBI) dataset is used to validate the performance of the proposed feature extraction algorithm and the real-time data recorded in our self-designed system is used to validate the performance of the proposed classification algorithm under class-imbalanced situations. Different from the pseudo-random paradigm, the ErrPs signals collected in our experiments are all elicited by four-class of online MI-BCI tasks, and the sample distribution is more natural and suitable for practical tests.<i>Main results.</i>The experimental results on the CNBI dataset show that the average accuracy and false positive rate for ErrPs detection are 94.1% and 8.1%, which outperforms methods using features extracted from a single domain. What's more, although the ErrPs induction rate is affected by the performance of subjects' MI-BCI tasks, experimental results on data recorded in the self-designed system prove that the ErrPs classification algorithm based on an adaptive threshold is robust under different ErrPs data distributions. Compared with two other methods, the proposed algorithm has advantages in all three measures which are accuracy, F1-score and false positive rate. Finally, ErrPs detection results were used to prevent wrong actions in a MI-BCI experiment, and it leads to a reduction of the hybrid BCI error rate from 48.9% to 24.3% in online tests.<i>Significance.</i>Both the AAR-CSP fused feature extraction and the adaptive threshold based SRDA classification methods suggested in our work are efficient in improving the ErrPs detection accuracy and reducing the false positives. In addition, by introducing ErrPs to multi-class MI-BCIs, the MI decoding results can be corrected after ErrPs are detected to avoid executing wrong instructions, thereby improving the BCI accuracy and lays the foundation for using MI-BCIs in practical applications."
33821808,"Motor imagery (MI) classification is an important task in the brain-computer interface (BCI) field. MI data exhibit highly dynamic characteristics and are difficult to obtain. Therefore, the performance of the classification model will be challenged. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been employed for MI classification and have demonstrated favorable performances. However, the traditional CNN model uses an end-to-end output method, and part of the feature information is discarded during the transmission process. Herein, we propose a novel algorithm, that is, a combined long short-term memory generative adversarial networks (LGANs) and multi-output convolutional neural network (MoCNN) for MI classification, and an attention network for improving model performance. Specifically, the proposed method comprises three steps. First, MI data are obtained, and preprocessing is performed. Second, additional data are generated for training. Here, a data augmentation method based on a LGAN is designed. Last, the MoCNN is proposed to improve the classification performance. The BCI competition IV datasets 2a and 2b are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. With multiple evaluation indicators, the proposed generative model can generate more realistic data. The expanded training set improves the performance of the classification model. The results show that the proposed method improves the classification of MI data, which facilitates motion imagination."
33819158,"The common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm is the most popular spatial filtering method applied to extract electroencephalogram (EEG) features for motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. The effectiveness of the CSP algorithm depends on optimal selection of the frequency band and time window from the EEG. Many algorithms have been designed to optimize frequency band selection for CSP, while few algorithms seek to optimize the time window. This study proposes a novel framework, termed common time-frequency-spatial patterns (CTFSP), to extract sparse CSP features from multi-band filtered EEG data in multiple time windows. Specifically, the whole MI period is first segmented into multiple subseries using a sliding time window approach. Then, sparse CSP features are extracted from multiple frequency bands in each time window. Finally, multiple support vector machine (SVM) classifiers with the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel are trained to identify the MI tasks and the voting result of these classifiers determines the final output of the BCI. This study applies the proposed CTFSP algorithm to three public EEG datasets (BCI competition III dataset IVa, BCI competition III dataset IIIa, and BCI competition IV dataset 1) to validate its effectiveness, compared against several other state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is a promising candidate for improving the performance of MI-BCI systems."
33817022,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a viable alternative communication strategy for patients of neurological disorders as it facilitates the translation of human intent into device commands. The performance of BCIs primarily depends on the efficacy of the feature extraction and feature selection techniques, as well as the classification algorithms employed. More often than not, high dimensional feature set contains redundant features that may degrade a given classifier's performance. In the present investigation, an ensemble learning-based classification algorithm, namely random subspace <i>k</i>-nearest neighbour (<i>k</i>-NN) has been proposed to classify the motor imagery (MI) data. The common spatial pattern (CSP) has been applied to extract the features from the MI response, and the effectiveness of random forest (RF)-based feature selection algorithm has also been investigated. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method, an experimental study has been implemented using four publicly available MI dataset (BCI Competition III dataset 1 (data-1), dataset IIIA (data-2), dataset IVA (data-3) and BCI Competition IV dataset II (data-4)). It was shown that the ensemble-based random subspace <i>k</i>-NN approach achieved the superior classification accuracy (CA) of 99.21%, 93.19%, 93.57% and 90.32% for data-1, data-2, data-3 and data-4, respectively against other models evaluated, namely linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, random forest, Naïve Bayes and the conventional <i>k</i>-NN. In comparison with other classification approaches reported in the recent studies, the proposed method enhanced the accuracy by 2.09% for data-1, 1.29% for data-2, 4.95% for data-3 and 5.71% for data-4, respectively. Moreover, it is worth highlighting that the RF feature selection technique employed in the present study was able to significantly reduce the feature dimension without compromising the overall CA. The outcome from the present study implies that the proposed method may significantly enhance the accuracy of MI data classification."
33815081,"While often presented as promising assistive technologies for motor-impaired users, electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) remain barely used outside laboratories due to low reliability in real-life conditions. There is thus a need to design long-term reliable BCIs that can be used outside-of-the-lab by end-users, e.g., severely motor-impaired ones. Therefore, we propose and evaluate the design of a multi-class Mental Task (MT)-based BCI for longitudinal training (20 sessions over 3 months) of a tetraplegic user for the CYBATHLON BCI series 2019. In this BCI championship, tetraplegic pilots are mentally driving a virtual car in a racing video game. We aimed at combining a progressive user MT-BCI training with a newly designed machine learning pipeline based on adaptive Riemannian classifiers shown to be promising for real-life applications. We followed a two step training process: the first 11 sessions served to train the user to control a 2-class MT-BCI by performing either two cognitive tasks (REST and MENTAL SUBTRACTION) or two motor-imagery tasks (LEFT-HAND and RIGHT-HAND). The second training step (9 remaining sessions) applied an adaptive, session-independent Riemannian classifier that combined all 4 MT classes used before. Moreover, as our Riemannian classifier was incrementally updated in an unsupervised way it would capture both within and between-session non-stationarity. Experimental evidences confirm the effectiveness of this approach. Namely, the classification accuracy improved by about 30% at the end of the training compared to initial sessions. We also studied the neural correlates of this performance improvement. Using a newly proposed BCI user learning metric, we could show our user learned to improve his BCI control by producing EEG signals matching increasingly more the BCI classifier training data distribution, rather than by improving his EEG class discrimination. However, the resulting improvement was effective only on synchronous (cue-based) BCI and it did not translate into improved CYBATHLON BCI game performances. For the sake of overcoming this in the future, we unveil possible reasons for these limited gaming performances and identify a number of promising future research directions. Importantly, we also report on the evolution of the user's neurophysiological patterns and user experience throughout the BCI training and competition."
33815080,"Due to the individual differences controlling brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), the applicability and accuracy of BCIs based on motor imagery (MI-BCIs) are limited. To improve the performance of BCIs, this article examined the effect of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) on brain activity during MI. This article designed an experimental paradigm that combines tES and MI and examined the effects of tES based on the measurements of electroencephalogram (EEG) features in MI processing, including the power spectral density (PSD) and dynamic event-related desynchronization (ERD). Finally, we investigated the effect of tES on the accuracy of MI classification using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The results showed that the ERD of the μ and β rhythms in the left-hand MI task was enhanced after electrical stimulation with a significant effect in the tDCS group. The average classification accuracy of the transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) group and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) group (88.19% and 89.93% respectively) were improved significantly compared to the pre-and pseudo stimulation groups. These findings indicated that tES can improve the performance and applicability of BCI and that tDCS was a potential approach in regulating brain activity and enhancing valid features during noninvasive MI-BCI processing."
33809317,"Recently, studies on cycling-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been standing out due to their potential for lower-limb recovery. In this scenario, the behaviors of the sensory motor rhythms and the brain connectivity present themselves as sources of information that can contribute to interpreting the cortical effect of these technologies. This study aims to analyze how sensory motor rhythms and cortical connectivity behave when volunteers command reactive motor imagery (MI) BCI that provides passive pedaling feedback. We studied 8 healthy subjects who performed pedaling MI to command an electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI with a motorized pedal to receive passive movements as feedback. The EEG data were analyzed under the following four conditions: resting, MI calibration, MI online, and receiving passive pedaling (on-line phase). Most subjects produced, over the foot area, significant event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns around Cz when performing MI and receiving passive pedaling. The sharpest decrease was found for the low beta band. The connectivity results revealed an exchange of information between the supplementary motor area (SMA) and parietal regions during MI and passive pedaling. Our findings point to the primary motor cortex activation for most participants and the connectivity between SMA and parietal regions during pedaling MI and passive pedaling."

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the electroencephalogram (EEG) based MI-BCI system. It describes the current state of the art in different stages of the MI-BCI (data acquisition, MI training, preprocessing, feature extraction, channel and feature selection, and classification) pipeline.

33801817,"Motor imaging (MI) induces recovery and neuroplasticity in neurophysical regulation. However, a non-negligible portion of users presents insufficient coordination skills of sensorimotor cortex control. Assessments of the relationship between wakefulness and tasks states are conducted to foster neurophysiological and mechanistic interpretation in MI-related applications. Thus, to understand the organization of information processing, measures of functional connectivity are used. Also, models of neural network regression prediction are becoming popular, These intend to reduce the need for extracting features manually. However, predicting MI practicing's neurophysiological inefficiency raises several problems, like enhancing network regression performance because of the overfitting risk. Here, to increase the prediction performance, we develop a deep network regression model that includes three procedures: leave-one-out cross-validation combined with Monte Carlo dropout layers, subject clustering of MI inefficiency, and transfer learning between neighboring runs. Validation is performed using functional connectivity predictors extracted from two electroencephalographic databases acquired in conditions close to real MI applications (150 users), resulting in a high prediction of pretraining desynchronization and initial training synchronization with adequate physiological interpretability."
33801070,"Motor imagery (MI) is widely used to produce input signals for brain-computer interfaces (BCI) due to the similarities between MI-BCI and the planning-execution cycle. Despite its usefulness, MI tasks can be ambiguous to users and MI produces weaker cortical signals than motor execution. Existing MI guidance systems, which have been reported to provide visual guidance for MI and enhance MI, still have limitations: insufficient immersion for MI or poor expandability to MI for another body parts. We propose a guidance system for MI enhancement that can immerse users in MI and will be easy to extend to other body parts and target motions with few physical constraints. To make easily extendable MI guidance system, the virtual hand illusion is applied to the MI guidance system with a motion tracking sensor. MI enhancement was evaluated in 11 healthy people by comparison with another guidance system and conventional motor commands for BCI. The results showed that the proposed MI guidance system produced an amplified cortical signal compared to pure MI (<i>p</i> < 0.017), and a similar cortical signal as those produced by both actual execution (<i>p</i> > 0.534) and an MI guidance system with the rubber hand illusion (<i>p</i> > 0.722) in the contralateral region. Therefore, we believe that the proposed MI guidance system with the virtual hand illusion is a viable alternative to existing MI guidance systems in various applications with MI-BCI."
33795705,"Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are valuable tools that expand the nature of communication through bypassing traditional neuromuscular pathways. The non-invasive, intuitive, and continuous nature of sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) based BCIs enables individuals to control computers, robotic arms, wheel-chairs, and even drones by decoding motor imagination from electroencephalography (EEG). Large and uniform datasets are needed to design, evaluate, and improve the BCI algorithms. In this work, we release a large and longitudinal dataset collected during a study that examined how individuals learn to control SMR-BCIs. The dataset contains over 600 hours of EEG recordings collected during online and continuous BCI control from 62 healthy adults, (mostly) right hand dominant participants, across (up to) 11 training sessions per participant. The data record consists of 598 recording sessions, and over 250,000 trials of 4 different motor-imagery-based BCI tasks. The current dataset presents one of the largest and most complex SMR-BCI datasets publicly available to date and should be useful for the development of improved algorithms for BCI control."
33788862,"Common spatial pattern (CSP) is shown to be an effective pre-processing algorithm in order to discriminate different classes of motor-based EEG signals by obtaining suitable spatial filters. The performance of these filters can be improved by regularized CSP, in which available prior information is added in terms of regularization terms into the objective function of conventional CSP. Variety of prior information can be used in this way. In this paper, we used time correlation between different classes of EEG signal as the prior information, which is clarified similarity between different classes of signal for regularizing CSP. Furthermore, the proposed objective function can be easily extended to more than two-class problems. We used three different standard datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Correlation-based CSP (CCSP) outperformed original CSP as well as the existing regularized CSP, Principle Component Cnalysis (PCA) and Fisher Discriminate Analysis (FDA) in both two-class and multi-class scenarios. The simulation results showed that the proposed method outperformed conventional CSP by 6.9% in 2-class and 2.23% in multi-class problem in term of mean classification accuracy."
33786390,"This paper presents an illusory visual motion stimulus-based brain-computer interface (BCI). We aim to use the proposed system to enhance the motor imagery (MI) modality. Since motor imagery requires a long time for training, a stimulation method with external stimuli through the sensory system is an alternative method for increasing efficiency. The research is divided into two parts. First, we observed the visual motion illusion pattern based on brain topographic maps for the novel BCI modality. Second, we implemented the illusory visual motion stimulus-based BCI system. Arrow and moving-arrow patterns were used to modulate alpha rhythms at the visual and motor cortex. The arrow pattern had an average classification accuracy of approximately 78.5%. Additionally, illusory visual motion stimulus-based BCI systems are proposed using the proposed feature extraction and decision-making algorithm. This proposed BCI system can control the cursor moving in the left or right direction with the designed algorithm to create five commands for assistive communication. Ten volunteers participated in the experiment, and a brain-computer interface system with motor imagery and an illusory visual motion stimulus were used to compare efficiencies. The results showed that the proposed method achieved approximately 4% higher accuracy than motor imagery. The accuracy of the proposed illusory visual motion stimulus and algorithm was approximately 80.3%. Therefore, an illusory visual motion stimulus hybrid BCI system can be incorporated into the MI-based BCI system for beginner motor imagery. Based on the results, the proposed assistive communication system can be used to enhance communication in people with severe disabilities."
33786162,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) target specific brain activity for neuropsychological rehabilitation, and also allow patients with motor disabilities to control mobility and communication devices. Motor imagery of single-handed actions is used in BCIs but many users cannot control the BCIs effectively, limiting applications in the health systems. Crosstalk is unintended brain activations that interfere with bimanual actions and could also occur during motor imagery. To test if crosstalk impaired BCI user performance, we recorded EEG in 46 participants while they imagined movements in four experimental conditions using motor imagery: left hand (L), right hand (R), tongue (T) and feet (F). Pairwise classification accuracies of the tasks were compared (LR, LF, LT, RF, RT, FT), using common spatio-spectral filters and linear discriminant analysis. We hypothesized that LR classification accuracy would be lower than every other combination that included a hand imagery due to crosstalk. As predicted, classification accuracy for LR (58%) was reliably the lowest. Interestingly, participants who showed poor LR classification also demonstrated at least one good TR, TL, FR or FL classification; and good LR classification was detected in 16% of the participants. For the first time, we showed that crosstalk occurred in motor imagery, and affected BCI performance negatively. Such effects are effector-sensitive regardless of the BCI methods used; and likely not apparent to the user or the BCI developer. This means that tasks choice is crucial when designing BCI. Critically, the effects of crosstalk appear mitigatable. We conclude that understanding crosstalk mitigation is important for improving BCI applicability.

33786085,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) system based on motor imagery (MI) usually adopts multichannel Electroencephalograph (EEG) signal recording method. However, EEG signals recorded in multi-channel mode usually contain many redundant and artifact information. Therefore, selecting a few effective channels from whole channels may be a means to improve the performance of MI-based BCI systems. We proposed a channel evaluation parameter called position priori weight-permutation entropy (PPWPE), which include amplitude information and position information of a channel. According to the order of PPWPE values, we initially selected half of the channels with large PPWPE value from all sampling electrode channels. Then, the binary gravitational search algorithm (BGSA) was used in searching a channel combination that will be used in determining an optimal channel combination. The features were extracted by common spatial pattern (CSP) method from the final selected channels, and the classifier was trained by support vector machine. The PPWPE + BGSA + CSP channel selection method is validated on two data sets. Results showed that the PPWPE + BGSA + CSP method obtained better mean classification accuracy (88.0% vs. 57.5% for Data set 1 and 91.1% vs. 79.4% for Data set 2) than All-C + CSP method. The PPWPE + BGSA + CSP method can achieve higher classification in fewer channels selected. This method has great potential to improve the performance of MI-based BCI systems."
33776673,"The quality and quantity of training data are crucial to the performance of a deep-learning-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system. However, it is not practical to record EEG data over several long calibration sessions. A promising time- and cost-efficient solution is artificial data generation or data augmentation (DA). Here, we proposed a DA method for the motor imagery (MI) EEG signal called brain-area-recombination (BAR). For the BAR, each sample was first separated into two ones (named half-sample) by left/right brain channels, and the artificial samples were generated by recombining the half-samples. We then designed two schemas (intra- and adaptive-subject schema) corresponding to the single- and multi-subject scenarios. Extensive experiments using the classifier of EEGnet were conducted on two public datasets under various training set sizes. In both schemas, the BAR method can make the EEGnet have a better performance of classification (<i>p</i> < 0.01). To make a comparative investigation, we selected two common DA methods (noise-added and flipping), and the BAR method beat them (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Further, using the proposed BAR for augmentation, EEGnet achieved up to 8.3% improvement than a typical decoding algorithm CSP-SVM (<i>p</i> < 0.01), note that both the models were trained on the augmented dataset. This study shows that BAR usage can significantly improve the classification ability of deep learning to MI-EEG signals. To a certain extent, it may promote the development of deep learning technology in the field of BCI."
33776653,"<b>Objective:</b> Brain-computer interface (BCI) training is becoming increasingly popular in neurorehabilitation. However, around one third subjects have difficulties in controlling BCI devices effectively, which limits the application of BCI training. Furthermore, the effectiveness of BCI training is not satisfactory in stroke rehabilitation. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a powerful neural modulatory approach with strong facilitatory effects. Here, we investigated whether iTBS would improve BCI accuracy and boost the neuroplastic changes induced by BCI training. <b>Methods:</b> Eight right-handed healthy subjects (four males, age: 20-24) participated in this two-session study (BCI-only session and iTBS+BCI session in random order). Neuroplastic changes were measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In BCI-only session, fNIRS was measured at baseline and immediately after BCI training. In iTBS+BCI session, BCI training was followed by iTBS delivered on the right primary motor cortex (M1). Single-pulse TMS was measured at baseline and immediately after iTBS. fNIRS was measured at baseline, immediately after iTBS, and immediately after BCI training. Paired-sample <i>t</i>-tests were used to compare amplitudes of motor-evoked potentials, cortical silent period duration, oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) concentration and functional connectivity across time points, and BCI accuracy between sessions. <b>Results:</b> No significant difference in BCI accuracy was detected between sessions (<i>p</i> > 0.05). In BCI-only session, functional connectivity matrices between motor cortex and prefrontal cortex were significantly increased after BCI training (<i>p</i>'s < 0.05). In iTBS+BCI session, amplitudes of motor-evoked potentials were significantly increased after iTBS (<i>p</i>'s < 0.05), but no change in HbO2 concentration or functional connectivity was observed throughout the whole session (<i>p</i>'s > 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> To our knowledge, this is the first study that investigated how iTBS targeted on M1 influences BCI accuracy and the acute neuroplastic changes after BCI training. Our results revealed that iTBS targeted on M1 did not influence BCI accuracy or facilitate the neuroplastic changes after BCI training. Therefore, M1 might not be an effective stimulation target of iTBS for the purpose of improving BCI accuracy or facilitate its effectiveness; other brain regions (i.e., prefrontal cortex) are needed to be further investigated as potentially effective stimulation targets."
33761480,"<i>Objective</i>. Development of a brain-computer interface (BCI) requires classification of brain neural activities to different states. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can measure the brain activities and has great potential for BCI. In recent years, a large number of classification algorithms have been proposed, in which deep learning methods, especially convolutional neural network (CNN) methods are successful. fNIRS signal has typical time series properties, we combined fNIRS data and kinds of CNN-based time series classification (TSC) methods to classify BCI task.<i>Approach</i>. In this study, participants were recruited for a left and right hand motor imagery experiment and the cerebral neural activities were recorded by fNIRS equipment (FOIRE-3000). TSC methods are used to distinguish the brain activities when imagining the left or right hand. We have tested the overall person, single person and overall person with single-channel classification results, and these methods achieved excellent classification results. We also compared the CNN-based TSC methods with traditional classification methods such as support vector machine.<i>Main results</i>. Experiments showed that the CNN-based methods have significant advantages in classification accuracy: the CNN-based methods have achieved remarkable results in the classification of left-handed and right-handed imagination tasks, reaching 98.6% accuracy on overall person, 100% accuracy on single person, and in the single-channel classification an accuracy of 80.1% has been achieved with the best-performing channel.<i>Significance</i>. These results suggest that using the CNN-based TSC methods can significantly improve the BCI performance and also lay the foundation for the miniaturization and portability of training rehabilitation equipment."
33752186,"Growing evidence suggests that EEG electrode (sensor) potential time series (PTS) of slow cortical potentials (SCPs) hold motor neural correlates that can be used for motion trajectory prediction (MTP), commonly by multiple linear regression (mLR). It is not yet known whether arm-joint trajectories can be reliably decoded from current sources, computed from sensor data, from which brain areas they can be decoded and using which neural features. In this study, the PTS of 44 sensors were fed into sLORETA source localization software to compute current source activity in 30 regions of interest (ROIs) found in a recent meta-analysis to be engaged in action execution, motor imagery and motor preparation. The current sources PTS and band-power time series (BTS) in several frequency bands and time lags were used to predict actual and imagined trajectories in 3D space of the three velocity components of the hand, elbow and shoulder of nine subjects using an mLR model. For all arm joints and movement types, current source SCPs PTS contributed most to trajectory reconstruction with time lags 150ms, 116ms and 84ms providing the highest contribution, and current source BTS in any of the tested frequency bands was not informative. Person's correlation coefficient (r) averaged across movement types, arm joints and velocity components using source data was slightly lower than using sensor data (r=0.25 and r=0.28, respectively). For each ROI, the three current source dipoles had different contribution to the reconstruction of each of the three velocity components. Overall, our results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting of actual and imagined 3D trajectories of all arm joints from current sources, computed from scalp EEG. These findings may be used by developers of a future BCI as a validated set of contributing ROIs."
33738147,"Most of effectiveness assessments of the widely-used Massage therapy were based on subjective routine clinical assessment tools, such as Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score. However, few studies demonstrated the impact of massage on the Electroencephalograph (EEG) rhythm decoding of Motor imagery (MI) and motion execution (ME) with trunk left/right bending in patients with skeletal muscle pain. We used the sample entropy (SampEn), permutation entropy (PermuEn), common spatial pattern (CSP) features, support vector machine (SVM) and logic regression (LR) classifiers. We also used the convolutional neural network (CNN) and attention-based bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) for classification. The averaged SampEn and PermuEn values of alpha rhythm decreased in almost fourteen channels for five statuses (quiet, MI with left/right bending, ME with left/right bending). It indicated that massage alleviates the pain for the patients of skeletal pain. Furthermore, compared with the SVM and LR classifiers, the BiLSTM method achieved a better area under curve (AUC) of 0.89 for the classification of MI with trunk left/right bending before massage. The AUC became smaller after massage than that before massage for the classification of MI with trunk left/right bending using CNN and BiLSTM methods. The Permutation direct indicator (PDI) score showed the significant difference for patients in different statuses (before vs after massage, and MI vs ME). Massage not only affects the quiet status, but also affects the MI and ME. Clinical Impact: Massage therapy may affect a bit on the accuracy of MI with trunk left/right bending and it change the topography of MI and ME with trunk left/right bending for the patients with skeletal muscle pain."
33729961,"In recent years, the brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) has been considered as a potential post-stroke rehabilitation technology. However, the recognition of MI relies on the event-related desynchronization (ERD) feature, which has poor task specificity. Further, there is the problem of false triggering (irrelevant mental activities recognized as the MI of the target limb). In this paper, we discuss the feasibility of reducing the false triggering rate using a novel paradigm, in which the steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (SSSEP) is combined with the MI (MI-SSSEP). Data from the target (right hand MI) and nontarget task (rest) were used to establish the recognition model, and three kinds of interference tasks were used to test the false triggering performance. In the MI-SSSEP paradigm, ERD and SSSEP features modulated by MI could be used for recognition, while in the MI paradigm, only ERD features could be used. The results showed that the false triggering rate of interference tasks with SSSEP features was reduced to 29.3%, which was far lower than the 55.5% seen under the MI paradigm with ERD features. Moreover, in the MI-SSSEP paradigm, the recognition rate of the target and nontarget task was also significantly improved. Further analysis showed that the specificity of SSSEP was significantly higher than that of ERD (p < 0.05), but the sensitivity was not significantly different. These results indicated that SSSEP modulated by MI could more specifically decode the target task MI, and thereby may have potential in achieving more accurate rehabilitation training."
33711832,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been used to control the gait of a virtual self-avatar with a proposed application in the field of gait rehabilitation. Some limitations of existing systems are: (a) some systems use mental imagery (MI) of movements other than gait; (b) most systems allow the user to take single steps or to walk but do not allow both; (c) most function in a single BCI mode (cue-paced or self-paced).<i>Objective</i>. The objective of this study was to develop a high performance multi-modal BCI to control single steps and forward walking of an immersive virtual reality avatar.<i>Approach</i>. This system used MI of these actions, in cue-paced and self-paced modes. Twenty healthy participants participated in this study, which was comprised of four sessions across four different days. They were cued to imagine a single step forward with their right or left foot, or to imagine walking forward. They were instructed to reach a target by using the MI of multiple steps (self-paced switch-control mode) or by maintaining MI of forward walking (continuous-control mode). The movement of the avatar was controlled by two calibrated regularized linear discriminate analysis classifiers that used the<i>µ</i>power spectral density over the foot area of the motor cortex as a feature. The classifiers were retrained after every session. For a subset of the trials, positive modified feedback (MDF) was presented to half of the participants, where the avatar moved correctly regardless of the classification of the participants' MI. The performance of the BCI was computed on each day, using different control modes.<i>Main results</i>. All participants were able to operate the BCI. Their average offline performance, after retraining the classifiers was 86.0 ± 6.1%, showing that the recalibration of the classifiers enhanced the offline performance of the BCI (<i>p</i>< 0.01). The average online performance was 85.9 ± 8.4% showing that MDF enhanced BCI performance (<i>p</i>= 0.001). The average performance was 83% at self-paced switch control and 92% at continuous control mode.<i>Significance</i>. This study reports on a first BCI to use motor imagery of the lower limbs in order to control the gait of an avatar with different control modes and different control commands (single steps or forward walking). BCI performance is increased in a novel way by combining three different performance enhancement techniques, resulting in a single high performance and multi-modal BCI system. This study also showed that the improvements due to the effects of MDF lasted for more than one session."

This paper proposes a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for accurate and robust EEG-based MI classification that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.<i>Approach.</i>The proposed CNN model, namely EEG-inception, is built on the backbone of the inception-time network, which has showed to be highly efficient and accurate for time-series classification. Also, the proposed network is an end-to-end classification, as it takes the raw EEG signals as the input and does not require complex EEG signal-preprocessing. Furthermore, this paper proposes a novel data augmentation method for EEG signals to enhance the accuracy, at least by 3%, and reduce overfitting with limited BCI datasets.<i>Main results.</i>The proposed model outperforms all state-of-the-art methods by achieving the average accuracy of 88.4% and 88.6% on the 2008 BCI Competition IV 2a (four-classes) and 2b datasets (binary-classes), respectively. Furthermore, it takes less than 0.025 s to test a sample suitable for real-time processing. Moreover, the classification standard deviation for nine different subjects achieves the lowest value of 5.5 for the 2b dataset and 7.1 for the 2a dataset, which validates that the proposed method is highly robust.<i>Significance.</i>From the experiment results, it can be inferred that the EEG-inception network exhibits a strong potential as a subject-independent classifier for EEG-based MI tasks."
33687833,"This article shows the interest in deep learning techniques to detect motor imagery (MI) from raw electroencephalographic (EEG) signals when a functional electrical stimulation is added or not. Impacts of electrode montages and bandwidth are also reported. The perspective of this work is to improve the detection of intraoperative awareness during general anesthesia. Various architectures of EEGNet were investigated to optimize MI detection. They have been compared to the state-of-the-art classifiers in Brain-Computer Interfaces (based on Riemannian geometry, linear discriminant analysis), and other deep learning architectures (deep convolution network, shallow convolutional network). EEG data were measured from 22 participants performing motor imagery with and without median nerve stimulation. The proposed architecture of EEGNet reaches the best classification accuracy (83.2%) and false-positive rate (FPR 19.0%) for a setup with only six electrodes over the motor cortex and frontal lobe and for an extended 4-38 Hz EEG frequency range while the subject is being stimulated via a median nerve. Configurations with a larger number of electrodes result in higher accuracy (94.5%) and FPR (6.1%) for 128 electrodes (and respectively 88.0% and 12.9% for 13 electrodes). The present work demonstrates that using an extended EEG frequency band and a modified EEGNet deep neural network increases the accuracy of MI detection when used with as few as 6 electrodes which include frontal channels. The proposed method contributes to the development of Brain-Computer Interface systems based on MI detection from EEG."
33679965,"In the research of motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI), traditional electroencephalogram (EEG) signal recognition algorithms appear to be inefficient in extracting EEG signal features and improving classification accuracy. In this paper, we discuss a solution to this problem based on a novel step-by-step method of feature extraction and pattern classification for multiclass MI-EEG signals. First, the training data from all subjects is merged and enlarged through autoencoder to meet the need for massive amounts of data while reducing the bad effect on signal recognition because of randomness, instability, and individual variability of EEG data. Second, an end-to-end sharing structure with attention-based time-incremental shallow convolution neural network is proposed. Shallow convolution neural network (SCNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network are used to extract frequency-spatial domain features and time-series features of EEG signals, respectively. Then, the attention model is introduced into the feature fusion layer to dynamically weight these extracted temporal-frequency-spatial domain features, which greatly contributes to the reduction of feature redundancy and the improvement of classification accuracy. At last, validation tests using BCI Competition IV 2a data sets show that classification accuracy and kappa coefficient have reached 82.7 ± 5.57% and 0.78 ± 0.074, which can strongly prove its advantages in improving classification accuracy and reducing individual difference among different subjects from the same network."
33628220,"Feature extraction is essential for classifying different motor imagery (MI) tasks in a brain-computer interface. To improve classification accuracy, we propose a novel feature extraction method in which the connectivity increment rate (CIR) of the brain function network (BFN) is extracted. First, the BFN is constructed on the basis of the threshold matrix of the Pearson correlation coefficient of the mu rhythm among the channels. In addition, a weighted BFN is constructed and expressed by the sum of the existing edge weights to characterize the cerebral cortex activation degree in different movement patterns. Then, on the basis of the topological structures of seven mental tasks, three regional networks centered on the C3, C4, and Cz channels are constructed, which are consistent with correspondence between limb movement patterns and cerebral cortex in neurophysiology. Furthermore, the CIR of each regional functional network is calculated to form three-dimensional vectors. Finally, we use the support vector machine to learn a classifier for multiclass MI tasks. Experimental results show a significant improvement and demonstrate the success of the extracted feature CIR in dealing with MI classification. Specifically, the average classification performance reaches 88.67% which is higher than other competing methods, indicating that the extracted CIR is effective for MI classification."
33587702,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been widely used in brain computer interface (BCI) due to its convenience and reliability. The EEG-based BCI applications are majorly limited by the time-consuming calibration procedure for discriminative feature representation and classification. Existing EEG classification methods either heavily depend on the handcrafted features or require adequate annotated samples at each session for calibration. To address these issues, we propose a novel dynamic joint domain adaptation network based on adversarial learning strategy to learn domain-invariant feature representation, and thus improve EEG classification performance in the target domain by leveraging useful information from the source session. Specifically, we explore the global discriminator to align the marginal distribution across domains, and the local discriminator to reduce the conditional distribution discrepancy between sub-domains via conditioning on deep representation as well as the predicted labels from the classifier. In addition, we further investigate a dynamic adversarial factor to adaptively estimate the relative importance of alignment between the marginal and conditional distributions. To evaluate the efficacy of our method, extensive experiments are conducted on two public EEG datasets, namely, Datasets IIa and IIb of BCI Competition IV. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods."
33586668,"One of the recent developments in the field of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) is the reinforcement learning (RL) based BCI paradigm, which uses neural error responses as the reward feedback on the agent's action. While having several advantages over motor imagery based BCI, the reliability of RL-BCI is critically dependent on the decoding accuracy of noisy neural error signals. A principled method is needed to optimally handle this inherent noise under general conditions. By determining a trade-off between the expected value and the informational cost of policies, the info-RL (IRL) algorithm provides optimal low-complexity policies, which are robust under noisy reward conditions and achieve the maximal obtainable value. In this work we utilize the IRL algorithm to characterize the maximal obtainable value under different noise levels, which in turn is used to extract the optimal robust policy for each noise level. Our simulation results of a setting with Gaussian noise show that the complexity level of the optimal policy is dependent on the reward magnitude but not on the reward variance, whereas the variance determines whether a lower complexity solution is favorable or not. We show how this analysis can be utilized to select optimal robust policies for an RL-BCI and demonstrate its use on EEG data. We propose here a principled method to determine the optimal policy complexity of an RL problem with a noisy reward, which we argue is particularly useful for RL-based BCI paradigms. This framework may be used to minimize initial training time and allow for a more dynamic and robust shared control between the agent and the operator under different conditions."
33568973,"The motor imagery (MI) paradigm has been wildly used in brain-computer interface (BCI), but the difficulties in performing imagery tasks limit its application. Mechanical vibration stimulus has been increasingly used to enhance the MI performance, but its improvement consistence is still under debate. To develop more effective vibration stimulus methods for consistently enhancing MI, this study proposes an EEG phase-dependent closed-loop mechanical vibration stimulation method. The subject's index finger of the non-dominant hand was given 4 different vibration stimulation conditions (i.e., continuous open-loop vibration stimulus, two different phase-dependent closed-loop vibration stimuli and no stimulus) when performing two tasks of imagining movement and rest of the index finger from his/her dominant hand. We compared MI performance and brain oscillatory patterns under different conditions to verify the effectiveness of this method. The subjects performed 80 trials of each type in a random order, and the average phase-lock value of closed-loop stimulus conditions was 0.71. It was found that the closed-loop vibration stimulus applied in the falling phase helped the subjects to produce stronger event-related desynchronization (ERD) and sustain longer. Moreover, the classification accuracy was improved by about 9% compared with MI without any vibration stimulation (<i>p</i> = 0.012, paired <i>t</i>-test). This method helps to modulate the mu rhythm and make subjects more concentrated on the imagery and without negative enhancement during rest tasks, ultimately improves MI-based BCI performance. Participants reported that the tactile fatigue under closed-loop stimulation conditions was significantly less than continuous stimulation. This novel method is an improvement to the traditional vibration stimulation enhancement research and helps to make stimulation more precise and efficient."
33561080,"Pain is an under-reported but prevalent symptom in Parkinson's Disease (PD), impacting patients' quality of life. Both pain and PD conditions cause cortical excitability reduction and non-invasive brain stimulation. Mental representation techniques are thought to be able to counteract it, also resulting effectively in chronic pain conditions. We aim to conduct two independent studies in order to evaluate the efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and mental representation protocol in the management of pain in PD patients during the ON state: (1) tDCS over the Primary Motor Cortex (M1); and (2) Action Observation (AO) and Motor Imagery (MI) training through a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) using Virtual Reality (AO + MI-BCI). Both studies will include 32 subjects in a longitudinal prospective parallel randomized controlled trial design under different blinding conditions. The main outcomes will be score changes in King's Parkinson's Disease Pain Scale, Brief Pain Inventory, Temporal Summation, Conditioned Pain Modulation, and Pain Pressure Threshold. Assessment will be performed pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 15 days post-intervention, in both ON and OFF states."
33551719,"Sensorimotor rhythm (SMR)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide an alternative pathway for users to perform motor control using motor imagery. Despite the non-invasiveness, ease of use, and low cost, this kind of BCI has limitations due to long training times and BCI inefficiency-that is, the SMR BCI control paradigm may not work well on a subpopulation of users. Meditation is a mental training method to improve mindfulness and awareness and is reported to have positive effects on one's mental state. Here, we investigated the behavioral and electrophysiological differences between experienced meditators and meditation naïve subjects in one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) cursor control tasks. We found numerical evidence that meditators outperformed control subjects in both tasks (1D and 2D), and there were fewer BCI inefficient subjects in the meditator group. Finally, we also explored the neurophysiological difference between the two groups and showed that the meditators had a higher resting SMR predictor, more stable resting mu rhythm, and a larger control signal contrast than controls during the task."
33545691,"<i>Objective</i>. Motor imagery electroencephalography (EEG) decoding is a vital technology for the brain-computer interface (BCI) systems and has been widely studied in recent years. However, the original EEG signals usually contain a lot of class-independent information, and the existing motor imagery EEG decoding methods are easily interfered by this irrelevant information, which greatly limits the decoding accuracy of these methods.<i>Approach</i>. To overcome the interference of the class-independent information, a motor imagery EEG decoding method based on feature separation is proposed in this paper. Furthermore, a feature separation network based on adversarial learning (FSNAL) is designed for the feature separation of the original EEG samples. First, the class-related features and class-independent features are separated by the proposed FSNAL framework, and then motor imagery EEG decoding is performed only according to the class-related features to avoid the adverse effects of class-independent features.<i>Main results</i>. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed motor imagery EEG decoding method, we conduct some experiments on two public EEG datasets (the BCI competition IV 2a and 2b datasets). The experimental results comparison between our method and some state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that our motor imagery EEG decoding method outperforms all the compared methods on the two experimental datasets.<i>Significance</i>. Our motor imagery EEG decoding method can alleviate the interference of class-independent features, and it has great application potential for improving the performance of motor imagery BCI systems in the near future."
33540387,"<i>Objective.</i>Motor imagery (MI) EEG signals vary greatly among subjects, so scholarly research on motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) has mainly focused on single-subject systems or subject-dependent systems. However, the single-subject model is applicable only to the target subject, and the small sample number greatly limits the performance of the model. This paper aims to study a convolutional neural network to achieve an adaptable MI-BCI that is applicable to multiple subjects.<i>Approach.</i>In this paper, a twin cascaded softmax convolutional neural network (TCSCNN) is proposed for multisubject MI-BCIs. The proposed TCSCNN is independent and can be applied to any single-subject MI classification convolutional neural network (CNN) model. First, to reduce the influence of individual differences, subject recognition and MI recognition are accomplished simultaneously. A cascaded softmax structure consisting of two softmax layers, related to subject recognition and MI recognition, is subsequently applied. Second, to improve the MI classification precision, a twin network structure is proposed on the basis of ensemble learning. TCSCNN is built by combining a cascaded softmax structure and twin network structure.<i>Main results.</i>Experiments were conducted on three popular CNN models (EEGNet and Shallow ConvNet and Deep ConvNet from EEGDecoding) and three public datasets (BCI Competition IV datasets 2a and 2b and the high-gamma dataset) to verify the performance of the proposed TCSCNN. The results show that compared with the state-of-the-art CNN model, the proposed TCSCNN obviously improves the precision and convergence of multisubject MI recognition.<i>Significance.</i>This study provides a promising scheme for multisubject MI-BCI, reflecting the progress made in the development and application of MI-BCIs."
33524962,"<i>Objective.</i>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) decode information from neural activity and send it to external devices. The use of Deep Learning approaches for decoding allows for automatic feature engineering within the specific decoding task. Physiologically plausible interpretation of the network parameters ensures the robustness of the learned decision rules and opens the exciting opportunity for automatic knowledge discovery.<i>Approach.</i>We describe a compact convolutional network-based architecture for adaptive decoding of electrocorticographic (ECoG) data into finger kinematics. We also propose a novel theoretically justified approach to interpreting the spatial and temporal weights in the architectures that combine adaptation in both space and time. The obtained spatial and frequency patterns characterizing the neuronal populations pivotal to the specific decoding task can then be interpreted by fitting appropriate spatial and dynamical models.<i>Main results.</i>We first tested our solution using realistic Monte-Carlo simulations. Then, when applied to the ECoG data from Berlin BCI competition IV dataset, our architecture performed comparably to the competition winners without requiring explicit feature engineering. Using the proposed approach to the network weights interpretation we could unravel the spatial and the spectral patterns of the neuronal processes underlying the successful decoding of finger kinematics from an ECoG dataset. Finally we have also applied the entire pipeline to the analysis of a 32-channel EEG motor-imagery dataset and observed physiologically plausible patterns specific to the task.<i>Significance.</i>We described a compact and interpretable CNN architecture derived from the basic principles and encompassing the knowledge in the field of neural electrophysiology. For the first time in the context of such multibranch architectures with factorized spatial and temporal processing we presented theoretically justified weights interpretation rules.

33524961,"<i>Objective</i>. Motor imagery (MI) is a mental representation of motor behavior and a widely used pattern in electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. EEG is known for its non-stationary, non-linear features and sensitivity to artifacts from various sources. This study aimed to design a powerful classifier with a strong generalization capability for MI based BCIs.<i>Approach</i>. In this study, we proposed a cluster decomposing based ensemble learning framework (CDECL) for EEG classification of MI based BCIs. The EEG data was decomposed into sub-data sets with different distributions by clustering decomposition. Then a set of heterogeneous classifiers was trained on each sub-data set for generating a diversified classifier search space. To obtain the optimal classifier combination, the ensemble learning was formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem and a stochastic fractal based binary multi-objective fruit fly optimization algorithm was proposed for solving the ensemble learning problem.<i>Main results.</i>The proposed method was validated on two public EEG datasets (BCI Competition IV datasets IIb and BCI Competition IV dataset IIa) and compared with several other competing classification methods. Experimental results showed that the proposed CDECL based methods can effectively construct a diversity ensemble classifier and exhibits superior classification performance in comparison with several competing methods.<i>Significance</i>. The proposed method is promising for improving the performance of MI-based BCIs."
33505456,"Motor imagery (MI) is an important part of brain-computer interface (BCI) research, which could decode the subject's intention and help remodel the neural system of stroke patients. Therefore, accurate decoding of electroencephalography- (EEG-) based motion imagination has received a lot of attention, especially in the research of rehabilitation training. We propose a novel multifrequency brain network-based deep learning framework for motor imagery decoding. Firstly, a multifrequency brain network is constructed from the multichannel MI-related EEG signals, and each layer corresponds to a specific brain frequency band. The structure of the multifrequency brain network matches the activity profile of the brain properly, which combines the information of channel and multifrequency. The filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) algorithm filters the MI-based EEG signals in the spatial domain to extract features. Further, a multilayer convolutional network model is designed to distinguish different MI tasks accurately, which allows extracting and exploiting the topology in the multifrequency brain network. We use the public BCI competition IV dataset 2a and the public BCI competition III dataset IIIa to evaluate our framework and get state-of-the-art results in the first dataset, i.e., the average accuracy is 83.83% and the value of kappa is 0.784 for the BCI competition IV dataset 2a, and the accuracy is 89.45% and the value of kappa is 0.859 for the BCI competition III dataset IIIa. All these results demonstrate that our framework can classify different MI tasks from multichannel EEG signals effectively and show great potential in the study of remodelling the neural system of stroke patients."
33501255,"In this study, the sources of EEG activity in motor imagery brain-computer interface (BCI) control experiments were investigated. Sixteen linear decomposition methods for EEG source separation were compared according to different criteria. The criteria were mutual information reduction between the source activities and physiological plausibility. The latter was tested by estimating the dipolarity of the source topographic maps, i.e., the accuracy of approximating the map by potential distribution from a single current dipole, as well as by the specificity of the source activity for different motor imagery tasks. The decomposition methods were also compared according to the number of shared components found. The results indicate that most of the dipolar components are found by the Independent Component Analysis Methods AMICA and PWCICA, which also provided the highest information reduction. These two methods also found the most task-specific EEG patterns of the blind source separation algorithms used. They are outperformed only by non-blind Common Spatial Pattern methods in terms of pattern specificity. The components found by all of the methods were clustered using the Attractor Neural Network with Increasing Activity. The results of the cluster analysis revealed the most frequent patterns of electrical activity occurring in the experiments. The patterns reflect blinking, eye movements, sensorimotor rhythm suppression during the motor imagery, and activations in the precuneus, supplementary motor area, and premotor areas of both hemispheres. Overall, multi-method decomposition with subsequent clustering and task-specificity estimation is a viable and informative procedure for processing the recordings of electrophysiological experiments."
33485365,"Hand rehabilitation is core to helping stroke survivors regain activities of daily living. Recent studies have suggested that the use of electroencephalography-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) can promote this process. Here, we report the first systematic examination of the literature on the use of BCI-robot systems for the rehabilitation of fine motor skills associated with hand movement and profile these systems from a technical and clinical perspective. A search for January 2010-October 2019 articles using Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PEDro, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore and Cochrane Library databases was performed. The selection criteria included BCI-hand robotic systems for rehabilitation at different stages of development involving tests on healthy participants or people who have had a stroke. Data fields include those related to study design, participant characteristics, technical specifications of the system, and clinical outcome measures. 30 studies were identified as eligible for qualitative review and among these, 11 studies involved testing a BCI-hand robot on chronic and subacute stroke patients. Statistically significant improvements in motor assessment scores relative to controls were observed for three BCI-hand robot interventions. The degree of robot control for the majority of studies was limited to triggering the device to perform grasping or pinching movements using motor imagery. Most employed a combination of kinaesthetic and visual response via the robotic device and display screen, respectively, to match feedback to motor imagery. 19 out of 30 studies on BCI-robotic systems for hand rehabilitation report systems at prototype or pre-clinical stages of development. We identified large heterogeneity in reporting and emphasise the need to develop a standard protocol for assessing technical and clinical outcomes so that the necessary evidence base on efficiency and efficacy can be developed."
33460382,"With the rapid development of deep learning, more and more deep learning-based motor imagery electroencephalograph (EEG) decoding methods have emerged in recent years. However, the existing deep learning-based methods usually only adopt the constraint of classification loss, which hardly obtains the features with high discrimination and limits the improvement of EEG decoding accuracy. In this paper, a discriminative feature learning strategy is proposed to improve the discrimination of features, which includes the central distance loss (CD-loss), the central vector shift strategy, and the central vector update process. First, the CD-loss is proposed to make the same class of samples converge to the corresponding central vector. Then, the central vector shift strategy extends the distance between different classes of samples in the feature space. Finally, the central vector update process is adopted to avoid the non-convergence of CD-loss and weaken the influence of the initial value of central vectors on the final results. In addition, overfitting is another severe challenge for deep learning-based EEG decoding methods. To deal with this problem, a data augmentation method based on circular translation strategy is proposed to expand the experimental datasets without introducing any extra noise or losing any information of the original data. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct some experiments on two public motor imagery EEG datasets (BCI competition IV 2a and 2b dataset), respectively. The comparison with current state-of-the-art methods indicates that our method achieves the highest average accuracy and good stability on the two experimental datasets."
33449886,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently been applied to electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). EEG is a noninvasive neuroimaging technique, which can be used to decode user intentions. Because the feature space of EEG data is highly dimensional and signal patterns are specific to the subject, appropriate methods for feature representation are required to enhance the decoding accuracy of the CNN model. Furthermore, neural changes exhibit high variability between sessions, subjects within a single session, and trials within a single subject, resulting in major issues during the modeling stage. In addition, there are many subject-dependent factors, such as frequency ranges, time intervals, and spatial locations at which the signal occurs, which prevent the derivation of a robust model that can achieve the parameterization of these factors for a wide range of subjects. However, previous studies did not attempt to preserve the multivariate structure and dependencies of the feature space. In this study, we propose a method to generate a spatiospectral feature representation that can preserve the multivariate information of EEG data. Specifically, 3-D feature maps were constructed by combining subject-optimized and subject-independent spectral filters and by stacking the filtered data into tensors. In addition, a layer-wise decomposition model was implemented using our 3-D-CNN framework to secure reliable classification results on a single-trial basis. The average accuracies of the proposed model were 87.15% (±7.31), 75.85% (±12.80), and 70.37% (±17.09) for the BCI competition data sets IV_2a, IV_2b, and OpenBMI data, respectively. These results are better than those obtained by state-of-the-art techniques, and the decomposition model obtained the relevance scores for neurophysiologically plausible electrode channels and frequency domains, confirming the validity of the proposed approach."
33444236,"In this paper, we utilized functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) technology to examine the hemodynamic responses in the motor cortex for two conditions, namely standing and sitting tasks. Nine subjects performed five trials of standing and sitting (SAS) tasks with both real movements and imagery thinking of SAS. A group level of statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis during these tasks showed bilateral activation of oxy-hemoglobin for both real movements and imagery experiments. Interestingly, the SPM analysis clearly revealed that the sitting tasks induced a higher oxy-hemoglobin level activation compared to the standing task. Remarkably, this finding is persistent across the 22 measured channels at the individual and group levels for both experiments. Furthermore, six features were extracted from pre-processed HbO signals and the performance of four different classifiers was examined in order to test the viability of using SAS tasks in future fNIRS-brain-computer interface (fNIRS-BCI) systems. In particular, two features-combination tests revealed that the signal slope with signal variance represents one of the three best two-combined features for its consistency in providing high accuracy results for both real and imagery experiments. This study shows the potential of implementing such tasks into the fNIRS-BCI system. In the future, the results of this work could pave the way towards the application of fNIRS-BCI in lower limb rehabilitation."
33438675,"Motor imagery (MI) constitutes a recurrent strategy for signals generation in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) - systems that aim to control external devices by directly associating brain responses to distinct commands. Although great improvement has been achieved in MI-BCIs performance over recent years, they still suffer from inter- and intra-subject variability issues. As an attempt to cope with this, some studies have suggested that MI training should aid users to appropriately modulate their response for BCI usage: generally, this training is performed based on the sensorimotor rhythms' modulation over the primary sensorimotor cortex (PMC), with the signal being feedbacked to the user. Nonetheless, recent studies have revisited the actual involvement of the PMC into MI, and little to no attention has been devoted to understanding the participation of other cortical areas into training protocols. Therefore, in this work, our aim was to analyze the response induced by hands MI of 10 healthy subjects in the form of event-related desynchronizations (ERDs) and to assess whether features from beyond the PMC might be useful for hands MI classification. We investigated how this response occurs for distinct frequency intervals between 7-30 Hz, and ex0plored changes in their evocation pattern across 12 MI training sessions without feedback. Overall, we found that ERD patterns occur differently for the frequencies encompassed by the μ and β bands, with its evocation being favored for the first band. Over time, the no-feedback approach was inefficient to aid in enhancing ERD evocation (EO). Moreover, to some extent, EO tends to decrease over blocks within a given run, and runs within an MI session, but remains stable within an MI block. We also found that the C3/C4 pair is not necessarily optimal for data classification, and both spectral and spatial subjects' specificities should be considered when designing training protocols."
33438628,"One of the main limitations for the practical use of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) is the calibration phase. Several methods have been suggested for the truncating of this undesirable time, including various variants of the popular CSP method. In this study, we cope with the problem, using local activities estimation (LAE). LAE is a spatial filtering technique that uses the EEG data of all electrodes along with their position information to emphasize the local activities. After spatial filtering by LAE, a few electrodes are selected based on physiological information. Then the features are extracted from the signal using FFT and classified by the support vector machine. In this study, the LAE is compared with CSP, RCSP, FBCSP and FBRCSP in two different electrode configurations of 118 and 64-channel. The LAE outperforms CSP-based methods in all experiments using the different number of training samples. The LAE method also obtains an average classification accuracy of 84% even with a calibration time of fewer than 2 min Significance: Unlike CSP-based methods, the LAE does not use the covariance matrix, and also uses a priori physiological information. Therefore, LAE can significantly reduce the calibration time while maintaining proper accuracy. It works well even with a few training samples."
33417560,"Graph signal processing (GSP) provides signal analytic tools for data defined in irregular domains, as is the case of non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG). In this work, the recently introduced technique of Graph Slepian functions is exploited for the robust decoding of motor imagery (MI) brain activity. The particular technique builds over the concept of graph Fourier transform (GFT) and provides additional flexibility in the subsequent data analysis by incorporating domain knowledge. Based on contrastive learning, we introduce an algorithmic pipeline that attains a data driven and subject specific design of Graph Slepian functions. These functions, by incorporating both the topology of the sensor array and the empirical evidence about the differential functional covariation, act as spatial filters that enhance the information conveyed by the multichannel signal and specifically relates to the participant's intention. The proposed technique for crafting Graph Slepians is incorporated in a MI-decoding scheme, in which the informed projections are fed to a support vector machine (SVM) that casts a prediction regarding the type of intended movement. The employed MI-decoder is evaluated based on two publicly available datasets and its superiority against popular alternatives in the field is established. Computational efficiency is listed among its main advantages, since it involves only simple matrix operations, allowing to consider its use in real-time implementations."
33414824,"Stroke is the leading cause of serious and long-term disability worldwide. Survivors may recover some motor functions after rehabilitation therapy. However, many stroke patients missed the best time period for recovery and entered into the sequela stage of chronic stroke. Studies have shown that motor imagery- (MI-) based brain-computer interface (BCI) has a positive effect on poststroke rehabilitation. This study used both virtual limbs and functional electrical stimulation (FES) as feedback to provide patients with a closed-loop sensorimotor integration for motor rehabilitation. An MI-based BCI system acquired, analyzed, and classified motor attempts from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The FES system would be activated if the BCI detected that the user was imagining wrist dorsiflexion on the instructed side of the body. Sixteen stroke patients in the sequela stage were randomly assigned to a BCI group and a control group. All of them participated in rehabilitation training for four weeks and were assessed by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) of motor function. The average improvement score of the BCI group was 3.5, which was higher than that of the control group (0.9). The active EEG patterns of the four patients in the BCI group whose FMA scores increased gradually became centralized and shifted to sensorimotor areas and premotor areas throughout the study. Study results showed evidence that patients in the BCI group achieved larger functional improvements than those in the control group and that the BCI-FES system is effective in restoring motor function to upper extremities in stroke patients. This study provides a more autonomous approach than traditional treatments used in stroke rehabilitation."
33411838,"Brain-machine interfaces (BMI) allows individuals to control an external device by controlling their own brain activity, without requiring bodily or muscle movements. Performing voluntary movements is associated with the experience of agency (""sense of agency"") over those movements and their outcomes. When people voluntarily control a BMI, they should likewise experience a sense of agency. However, using a BMI to act presents several differences compared to normal movements. In particular, BMIs lack sensorimotor feedback, afford lower controllability and are associated with increased cognitive fatigue. Here, we explored how these different factors influence the sense of agency across two studies in which participants learned to control a robotic hand through motor imagery decoded online through electroencephalography. We observed that the lack of sensorimotor information when using a BMI did not appear to influence the sense of agency. We further observed that experiencing lower control over the BMI reduced the sense of agency. Finally, we observed that the better participants controlled the BMI, the greater was the appropriation of the robotic hand, as measured by body-ownership and agency scores. Results are discussed based on existing theories on the sense of agency in light of the importance of BMI technology for patients using prosthetic limbs."
33401114,"In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for developing Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems. However, for deep learning models trained entirely on the data from a specific individual, the performance increase has only been marginal owing to the limited availability of subject-specific data. To overcome this, many transfer-based approaches have been proposed, in which deep networks are trained using pre-existing data from other subjects and evaluated on new target subjects. This mode of transfer learning however faces the challenge of substantial inter-subject variability in brain data. Addressing this, in this paper, we propose 5 schemes for adaptation of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based electroencephalography (EEG)-BCI system for decoding hand motor imagery (MI). Each scheme fine-tunes an extensively trained, pre-trained model and adapt it to enhance the evaluation performance on a target subject. We report the highest subject-independent performance with an average (N=54) accuracy of 84.19% (±9.98%) for two-class motor imagery, while the best accuracy on this dataset is 74.15% (±15.83%) in the literature. Further, we obtain a statistically significant improvement (p=0.005) in classification using the proposed adaptation schemes compared to the baseline subject-independent model."
33395961,"Upper limb weakness following a stroke affects 80% of survivors and is a key factor in preventing their return to independence. State-of-the art approaches to rehabilitation often require that the patient can generate some activity in the paretic limb, which is not possible for many patients in the early period following stroke. Approaches that enable more patients to engage with upper limb therapy earlier are urgently needed. Motor imagery has shown promise as a potential means to maintain activity in the brain's motor network, when the patient is incapable of generating functional movement. However, as imagery is a hidden mental process, it is impossible for individuals to gauge what impact this is having upon their neural activity. Here we used a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) approach allowing patients to gain an insight into the effect of motor imagery on their brain-muscle pathways, in real-time. Seven patients 2-26 weeks post stroke were provided with neurofeedback (NF) of their corticospinal excitability measured by the size of motor evoked potentials (MEP) in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The aim was to train patients to use motor imagery to increase the size of MEPs, using the BCI with a computer game displaying neurofeedback. Patients training finger muscles learned to elevate MEP amplitudes above their resting baseline values for the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles. By day 3 for ADM and day 4 for FDI, MEP amplitudes were sustained above baseline in all three NF blocks. Here we have described the first clinical implementation of TMS NF in a population of sub-acute stroke patients. The results show that in the context of severe upper limb paralysis, patients are capable of using neurofeedback to elevate corticospinal excitability in the affected muscles. This may provide a new training modality for early intervention following stroke."
33395676,"<i>Objective</i>. Motor imagery (MI) electroencephalography (EEG) classification is regarded as a promising technology for brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, which help people to communicate with the outside world using neural activities. However, decoding human intent accurately is a challenging task because of its small signal-to-noise ratio and non-stationary characteristics. Methods that directly extract features from raw EEG signals ignores key frequency domain information. One of the challenges in MI classification tasks is finding a way to supplement the frequency domain information ignored by the raw EEG signal.<i>Approach</i>. In this study, we fuse different models using their complementary characteristics to develop a multiscale space-time-frequency feature-guided multitask learning convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The proposed method consists of four modules: the space-time feature-based representation module, time-frequency feature-based representation module, multimodal fused feature-guided generation module, and classification module. The proposed framework is based on multitask learning. The four modules are trained using three tasks simultaneously and jointly optimized.<i>Results</i>. The proposed method is evaluated using three public challenge datasets. Through quantitative analysis, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms most state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning techniques for EEG classification, thereby demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our method. Moreover, the proposed method is employed to realize control of robot based on EEG signal, verifying its feasibility in real-time applications.<i>Significance</i>. To the best of our knowledge, a deep CNN architecture that fuses different input cases, which have complementary characteristics, has not been applied to BCI tasks. Because of the interaction of the three tasks in the multitask learning architecture, our method can improve the generalization and accuracy of subject-dependent and subject-independent methods with limited annotated data."
33390877,"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are systems that allow users to control devices using brain activity alone. However, the ability of participants to command BCIs varies from subject to subject. About 20% of potential users of sensorimotor BCIs do not gain reliable control of the system. The inefficiency to decode user's intentions requires the identification of neurophysiological factors determining ""good"" and ""poor"" BCI performers. One of the important neurophysiological aspects in BCI research is that the neuronal oscillations, used to control these systems, show a rich repertoire of spatial sensorimotor interactions. Considering this, we hypothesized that neuronal connectivity in sensorimotor areas would define BCI performance. Analyses for this study were performed on a large dataset of 80 inexperienced participants. They took part in a calibration and an online feedback session recorded on the same day. Undirected functional connectivity was computed over sensorimotor areas by means of the imaginary part of coherency. The results show that post- as well as pre-stimulus connectivity in the calibration recording is significantly correlated to online feedback performance in μ and feedback frequency bands. Importantly, the significance of the correlation between connectivity and BCI feedback accuracy was not due to the signal-to-noise ratio of the oscillations in the corresponding post and pre-stimulus intervals. Thus, this study demonstrates that BCI performance is not only dependent on the amplitude of sensorimotor oscillations as shown previously, but that it also relates to sensorimotor connectivity measured during the preceding training session. The presence of such connectivity between motor and somatosensory systems is likely to facilitate motor imagery, which in turn is associated with the generation of a more pronounced modulation of sensorimotor oscillations (manifested in ERD/ERS) required for the adequate BCI performance. We also discuss strategies for the up-regulation of such connectivity in order to enhance BCI performance."
33382658,"Existing studies have demonstrated that eye tracking can be a complementary approach to Electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interaction (BCI), especially in improving BCI performance in visual perception and cognition. In this paper, we proposed a method to fuse EEG and eye movement data extracted from motor imagery (MI) tasks. The results of the tests showed that on the feature layer, the average MI classification accuracy from the fusion of EEG and eye movement data was higher than that of pure EEG data or pure eye movement data, respectively. Besides, we also found that the average classification accuracy from the fusion on the decision layer was higher than that from the feature layer. Additionally, when EEG data were not available for the shifting of parts of electrodes, we combined EEG data collected from the rest of the electrodes (only 50% of the original) with the eye movement data, and the average MI classification accuracy was only 1.07% lower than that from all available electrodes. This result indicated that eye movement data was feasible to compensate for the loss of the EEG data in the MI scenario. Overall our approach was proved valuable and useful for augmenting MI based BCI applications."
33381220,"The motor-imagery brain-computer interface system (MI-BCI) has a board prospect for development. However, long calibration time and lack of enough MI commands limit its use in practice. In order to enlarge the command set, we add the combinations of traditional MI commands as new commands into the command set. We also design an algorithm based on transfer learning so as to decrease the calibration time for collecting EEG signal and training model. We create feature extractor based on data from traditional commands and transfer patterns through the data from new commands. Through the comparison of the average accuracy between our algorithm and traditional algorithms and the visualization of spatial patterns in our algorithm, we find that the accuracy of our algorithm is much higher than traditional algorithms, especially as for the low-quality datasets. Besides, the visualization of spatial patterns is meaningful. The algorithm based on transfer learning takes the advantage of the information from source data. We enlarge the command set while shortening the calibration time, which is of significant importance to the MI-BCI application."
33362458,"Motor imagery (MI) electroencephalography (EEG) classification is an important part of the brain-computer interface (BCI), allowing people with mobility problems to communicate with the outside world via assistive devices. However, EEG decoding is a challenging task because of its complexity, dynamic nature, and low signal-to-noise ratio. Designing an end-to-end framework that fully extracts the high-level features of EEG signals remains a challenge. In this study, we present a parallel spatial-temporal self-attention-based convolutional neural network for four-class MI EEG signal classification. This study is the first to define a new spatial-temporal representation of raw EEG signals that uses the self-attention mechanism to extract distinguishable spatial-temporal features. Specifically, we use the spatial self-attention module to capture the spatial dependencies between the channels of MI EEG signals. This module updates each channel by aggregating features over all channels with a weighted summation, thus improving the classification accuracy and eliminating the artifacts caused by manual channel selection. Furthermore, the temporal self-attention module encodes the global temporal information into features for each sampling time step, so that the high-level temporal features of the MI EEG signals can be extracted in the time domain. Quantitative analysis shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for intra-subject and inter-subject classification, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. In terms of qualitative analysis, we perform a visual inspection of the new spatial-temporal representation estimated from the learned architecture. Finally, the proposed method is employed to realize control of drones based on EEG signal, verifying its feasibility in real-time applications."
33353529,"A method for selecting electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCI) is proposed for enhancing the online interoperability and portability of BCI systems, as well as user comfort. The attempt is also to reduce variability and noise of MI-BCI, which could be affected by a large number of EEG channels. The relation between selected channels and MI-BCI performance is therefore analyzed. The proposed method is able to select acquisition channels common to all subjects, while achieving a performance compatible with the use of all the channels. Results are reported with reference to a standard benchmark dataset, the BCI competition IV dataset 2a. They prove that a performance compatible with the best state-of-the-art approaches can be achieved, while adopting a significantly smaller number of channels, both in two and in four tasks classification. In particular, classification accuracy is about 77-83% in binary classification with down to 6 EEG channels, and above 60% for the four-classes case when 10 channels are employed. This gives a contribution in optimizing the EEG measurement while developing non-invasive and wearable MI-based brain-computer interfaces."
33352714,"This study aimed to develop an intuitive gait-related motor imagery (MI)-based hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) controller for a lower-limb exoskeleton and investigate the feasibility of the controller under a practical scenario including stand-up, gait-forward, and sit-down. A filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) and mutual information-based best individual feature (MIBIF) selection were used in the study to decode MI electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and extract a feature matrix as an input to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. A successive eye-blink switch was sequentially combined with the EEG decoder in operating the lower-limb exoskeleton. Ten subjects demonstrated more than 80% accuracy in both offline (training) and online. All subjects successfully completed a gait task by wearing the lower-limb exoskeleton through the developed real-time BCI controller. The BCI controller achieved a time ratio of 1.45 compared with a manual smartwatch controller. The developed system can potentially be benefit people with neurological disorders who may have difficulties operating manual control."
33339011,"<i>Objective</i>. The common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm is an effective method to extract discriminatory features from electroencephalography (EEG) to be used by a brain-computer interface (BCI). However, informed selection of CSP filters typically requires oversight from a BCI expert to accept or reject filters based on the neurophysiological plausibility of their activation patterns. Our goal was to identify, analyze and automatically classify prototypical CSP patterns to enhance the prediction of motor imagery states in a BCI.<i>Approach</i>. A data-driven approach that used four publicly available EEG datasets was adopted. Cluster analysis revealed recurring, visually similar CSP patterns and a convolutional neural network was developed to distinguish between established CSP pattern classes. Furthermore, adaptive spatial filtering schemes that utilize the categorization of CSP patterns were proposed and evaluated.<i>Main results</i>. Classes of common neurophysiologically probable and improbable CSP patterns were established. Analysis of the relationship between these categories of CSP patterns and classification performance revealed discarding neurophysiologically improbable filters can decrease decoder performance. Further analysis revealed that the spatial orientation of EEG modulations can evolve over time, and that the features extracted from the original CSP filters can become inseparable. Importantly, it was shown through a novel adaptive CSP technique that adaptation in response to these emerging patterns can restore feature separability.<i>Significance</i>. These findings highlight the importance of considering and reporting on spatial filter activation patterns in both online and offline studies. They also emphasize to researchers in the field the importance of spatial filter adaptation in BCI decoder design, particularly for online studies with a focus on training users to develop stable and suitable brain patterns."
33338542,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) permits humans to interact with machines by decoding brainwaves to command for a variety of purposes. Convolutional neural networks (ConvNet) have improved the state-of-the-art of motor imagery decoding in an end-to-end approach. However, shallow ConvNets usually perform better than their deep counterparts. Thus, we aim to design a novel ConvNet that is deeper than the existing models, with an increase in terms of performances, and with optimal complexity. We develop a ConvNet based on Inception and Xception architectures that uses convolutional layers to extract temporal and spatial features. We adopt separable convolutions and depthwise convolutions to enable faster and efficient ConvNet. Then, we introduce a new block that is inspired by Inception to learn more rich features to improve the classification performances. The obtained results are comparable with other state-of-the-art techniques. Also, the weights of the convolutional layers give us some insights onto the learned features and reveal the most relevant ones. We show that our model significantly outperforms Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP), Riemannian Geometry (RG) approaches, and ShallowConvNet (p < 0.05). The obtained results prove that motor imagery decoding is possible without handcrafted features."
33328874,"In recent years, emerging matrix learning methods have shown promising performance in motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Nonetheless, the electroencephalography (EEG) pattern variations among different subjects necessitates collecting a large amount of labeled individual data for model training, which prolongs the calibration session. From the perspective of transfer learning, the model knowledge inherent in reference subjects incorporating few target EEG data have the potential to solve the above issue. Thus, a novel knowledge-leverage-based support matrix machine (KL-SMM) was developed to improve the classification performance when only a few labeled EEG data in the target domain (target subject) were available. The proposed KL-SMM possesses the powerful capability of a matrix learning machine, which allows it to directly learn the structural information from matrix-form EEG data. In addition, the KL-SMM can not only fully leverage few labeled EEG data from the target domain during the learning procedure but can also leverage the existing model knowledge from the source domain (source subject). Therefore, the KL-SMM can enhance the generalization performance of the target classifier while guaranteeing privacy protection to a certain extent. Finally, the objective function of the KL-SMM can be easily optimized using the alternating direction method of multipliers method. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the KL-SMM on publicly available MI-based EEG datasets. Experimental results demonstrated that the KL-SMM outperformed the comparable methods when the EEG data were insufficient."
33328845,"Motor imagery (MI) allows the design of self-paced brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which can potentially afford an intuitive and continuous interaction. However, the implementation of non-invasive MI-based BCIs with more than three commands is still a difficult task. First, the number of MIs for decoding different actions is limited by the constraint of maintaining an adequate spacing among the corresponding sources, since the electroencephalography (EEG) activity from near regions may add up. Second, EEG generates a rather noisy image of brain activity, which results in a poor classification performance. Here, we propose a solution to address the limitation of identifiable motor activities by using combined MIs (i.e., MIs involving 2 or more body parts at the same time). And we propose two new multilabel uses of the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio, namely MC2CMI and MC2SMI approaches. We recorded EEG signals from seven healthy subjects during an 8-class EEG experiment including the rest condition and all possible combinations using the left hand, right hand, and feet. The proposed multilabel approaches convert the original 8-class problem into a set of three binary problems to facilitate the use of the CSP algorithm. In the case of the MC2CMI method, each binary problem groups together in one class all the MIs engaging one of the three selected body parts, while the rest of MIs that do not engage the same body part are grouped together in the second class. In this way, for each binary problem, the CSP algorithm produces features to determine if the specific body part is engaged in the task or not. Finally, three sets of features are merged together to predict the user intention by applying an 8-class linear discriminant analysis. The MC2SMI method is quite similar, the only difference is that any of the combined MIs is considered during the training phase, which drastically accelerates the calibration time. For all subjects, both the MC2CMI and the MC2SMI approaches reached a higher accuracy than the classic pair-wise (PW) and one-vs.-all (OVA) methods. Our results show that, when brain activity is properly modulated, multilabel approaches represent a very interesting solution to increase the number of commands, and thus to provide a better interaction."
33297516,"A state-of-the-art brain-computer interface (BCI) system includes brain signal acquisition, noise removal, channel selection, feature extraction, classification, and an application interface. In functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based BCI (fNIRS-BCI) channel selection may enhance classification performance by identifying suitable brain regions that contain brain activity. In this study, the z-score method for channel selection is proposed to improve fNIRS-BCI performance. The proposed method uses cross-correlation to match the similarity between desired and recorded brain activity signals, followed by forming a vector of each channel's correlation coefficients' maximum values. After that, the z-score is calculated for each value of that vector. A channel is selected based on a positive z-score value. The proposed method is applied to an open-access dataset containing mental arithmetic (MA) and motor imagery (MI) tasks for twenty-nine subjects. The proposed method is compared with the conventional <i>t</i>-value method and with no channel selected, i.e., using all channels. The z-score method yielded significantly improved (<i>p</i> < 0.0167) classification accuracies of 87.2 ± 7.0%, 88.4 ± 6.2%, and 88.1 ± 6.9% for left motor imagery (LMI) vs. rest, right motor imagery (RMI) vs. rest, and mental arithmetic (MA) vs. rest, respectively. The proposed method is also validated on an open-access database of 17 subjects, containing right-hand finger tapping (RFT), left-hand finger tapping (LFT), and dominant side foot tapping (FT) tasks.The study shows an enhanced performance of the z-score method over the <i>t-</i>value method as an advancement in efforts to improve state-of-the-art fNIRS-BCI systems' performance."
33285871,"Decoding motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task because of the severe non-stationarity of perceptual decision processes. Recently, deep learning techniques have had great success in EEG decoding because of their prominent ability to learn features from raw EEG signals automatically. However, the challenge that the deep learning method faces is that the shortage of labeled EEG signals and EEGs sampled from other subjects cannot be used directly to train a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for a target subject. To solve this problem, in this paper, we present a novel conditional domain adaptation neural network (CDAN) framework for MI EEG signal decoding. Specifically, in the CDAN, a densely connected ConvNet is firstly applied to obtain high-level discriminative features from raw EEG time series. Then, a novel conditional domain discriminator is introduced to work as an adversarial with the label classifier to learn commonly shared intra-subjects EEG features. As a result, the CDAN model trained with sufficient EEG signals from other subjects can be used to classify the signals from the target subject efficiently. Competitive experimental results on a public EEG dataset (High Gamma Dataset) against the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework in recognizing MI EEG signals, indicating its effectiveness in automatic perceptual decision decoding."
33282474,"The present work shows the spatial reliability of the diffuse optical tomography (DOT) system in a group of healthy subjects during a motor imagery task. Prior to imagery task performance, the subjects executed a motor task based on the finger to thumb opposition for motor training, and to corroborate the DOT spatial localization during the motor execution. DOT technology and data treatment allows us to distinguish oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin at the cerebral gyri level unlike the cerebral activations provided by fMRI series that were processed using different approaches. Here we show the DOT reliability showing functional activations at the cerebral gyri level during motor execution and motor imagery, which provide subtler cerebral activations than the motor execution. These results will allow the use of the DOT system as a monitoring device in a brain computer interface."
33255578,"Electroencephalography (EEG) signals to detect motor imagery have been used to help patients with low mobility. However, the regular brain computer interfaces (BCI) capturing the EEG signals usually require intrusive devices and cables linked to machines. Recently, some commercial low-intrusive BCI headbands have appeared, but with less electrodes than the regular BCIs. Some works have proved the ability of the headbands to detect basic motor imagery. However, all of these works have focused on the accuracy of the detection, using session sizes larger than 10 s, in order to improve the accuracy. These session sizes prevent actuators using the headbands to interact with the user within an adequate response time. In this work, we explore the reduction of time-response in a low-intrusive device with only 4 electrodes using deep learning to detect right/left hand motion imagery. The obtained model is able to lower the detection time while maintaining an acceptable accuracy in the detection. Our findings report an accuracy above 83.8% for response time of 2 s overcoming the related works with both low- and high-intrusive devices. Hence, our low-intrusive and low-cost solution could be used in an interactive system with a reduced response time of 2 s."
33246319,"Classification of electroencephalography (EEG) signals with high accuracy using short recording intervals has been a challenging problem in developing brain computer interfaces (BCIs). This paper presents a novel feature extraction method for EEG recordings to tackle this problem. The proposed approach is based on the concept that the brain functions in a dynamic manner, and utilizes dynamic functional connectivity graphs. The EEG data is first segmented into intervals during which functional networks sustain their connectivity. Functional connectivity networks for each identified segment are then localized, and graphs are constructed, which will be used as features. To take advantage of the dynamic nature of the generated graphs, a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) classifier is employed for classification. Features extracted from various durations of post-stimulus EEG data associated with motor execution and imagery tasks are used to test the performance of the classifier. Results show an average accuracy of 85.32% using features extracted from only 500 ms of the post-stimulus data. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that using the proposed feature extraction method, it is possible to classify motor tasks from EEG recordings using a short interval of the data in the order of hundreds of milliseconds (e.g. 500 ms). This duration is considerably shorter than what has been reported before. These results will have significant implications for improving the effectiveness and the speed of BCIs, particularly for those used in assistive technologies."
33245696,"Effectively extracting common space pattern (CSP) features from motor imagery (MI) EEG signals is often highly dependent on the filter band selection. At the same time, optimizing the EEG channel combinations is another key issue that substantially affects the SMR feature representations. Although numerous algorithms have been developed to find channels that record important characteristics of MI, most of them select channels in a cumbersome way with low computational efficiency, thereby limiting the practicality of MI-based BCI systems. In this study, we propose the multi-scale optimization (MSO) of spatial patterns, optimizing filter bands over multiple channel sets within CSPs to further improve the performance of MI-based BCI. Specifically, several channel subsets are first heuristically predefined, and then raw EEG data specific to each of these subsets bandpass-filtered at the overlap between a set of filter bands. Further, instead of solving learning problems for each channel subset independently, we propose a multi-view learning based sparse optimization to jointly extract robust CSP features with L<sub>2,1</sub> -norm regularization, aiming to capture the shared salient information across multiple related spatial patterns for enhanced classification performance. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is then trained on these optimized EEG features for accurate recognition of MI tasks. Experimental results on three public EEG datasets validate the effectiveness of MSO compared to several other competing methods and their variants. These superior experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MSO method has promising potential in MI-based BCIs."

33220643,"Motor imagery (MI) brain-computer interface (BCI) and neurofeedback (NF) with electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are commonly used for motor function improvement in healthy subjects and to restore neurological functions in stroke patients. Generally, in order to decrease noisy and redundant information in unrelated EEG channels, channel selection methods are used which provide feasible BCI and NF implementations with better performances. Our assumption is that there are causal interactions between the channels of EEG signal in MI tasks that are repeated in different trials of a BCI and NF experiment. Therefore, a novel method for EEG channel selection is proposed which is based on Granger causality (GC) analysis. Additionally, the machine-learning approach is used to cluster independent component analysis (ICA) components of the EEG signal into artifact and normal EEG clusters. After channel selection, using the common spatial pattern (CSP) and regularized CSP (RCSP), features are extracted and with the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers, MI tasks are classified into left and right hand MI. The goal of this study is to achieve a method resulting in lower EEG channels with higher classification performance in MI-based BCI and NF by causal constraint. The proposed method based on GC, with only eight selected channels, results in 93.03% accuracy, 92.93% sensitivity, and 93.12% specificity, with RCSP feature extractor and best classifier for each subject, after being applied on Physionet MI dataset, which is increased by 3.95%, 3.73%, and 4.13%, in comparison with correlation-based channel selection method."

Such people suffer from a debility in daily functioning, which may lead to decreased and incoherence in daily routines and deteriorate their quality of life (QoL). Thus, there is an essential need for assistive systems to help those people achieve their daily actions and enhance their overall QoL. This study proposes a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) system for assisting people with limb motor disabilities in performing their daily life activities by using their brain signals to control assistive devices. The extraction of useful features is vital for an efficient BCI system. Therefore, the proposed system consists of a hybrid feature set that feeds into three machine-learning (ML) classifiers to classify motor Imagery (MI) tasks. This hybrid feature selection (FS) system is practical, real-time, and an efficient BCI with low computation cost. We investigate different combinations of channels to select the combination that has the highest impact on performance. The results indicate that the highest achieved accuracies using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier are 93.46% and 86.0% for the BCI competition III-IVa dataset and the autocalibration and recurrent adaptation dataset, respectively. These datasets are used to test the performance of the proposed BCI. Also, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed BCI by comparing its performance with recent studies. We show that the proposed system is accurate and efficient.

33211662,"Motor Imagery (MI)-based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system is a potential technology for active neurorehabilitation of stroke patients by complementing the conventional passive rehabilitation methods. Research to date mainly focused on classifying left vs. right hand/foot MI of stroke patients. Though a very few studies have reported decoding imagined hand movement directions using electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI, the experiments were conducted on healthy subjects. Our work analyzes MI-based brain cortical activity from EEG signals and decodes the imagined hand movement directions in stroke patients. The decoded direction (left vs. right) of hand movement imagination is used to provide control commands to a motorized arm support on which patient's affected (paralyzed) arm is placed. This enables the patient to move his/her stroke-affected hand towards the intended (imagined) direction that aids neuroplasticity in the brain. The synchronization measure called Phase Locking Value (PLV), extracted from EEG, is the neuronal signature used to decode the directional movement of the MI task. Event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) analysis on Mu and Beta frequency bands of EEG is done to select the time bin corresponding to the MI task. The dissimilarities between the two directions of MI tasks are identified by selecting the most significant channel pairs that provided maximum difference in PLV features. The training protocol has an initial calibration session followed by a feedback session with 50 trials of MI task in each session. The feedback session extracts PLV features corresponding to most significant channel pairs which are identified in the calibration session and is used to predict the direction of MI task in left/right direction. An average MI direction classification accuracy of 74.44% is obtained in performing the training protocol and 68.63% from the prediction protocol during feedback session on 16 stroke patients."
33206606,"Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has recently gained momentum in research on motor-imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, strikingly, most of the research effort is primarily devoted to enhancing fNIRS-based BCIs for healthy individuals. The ability of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), among the main BCI end-users to utilize fNIRS-based hemodynamic responses to efficiently control an MI-based BCI, has not yet been explored. This study aims to quantify subject-specific spatio-temporal characteristics of ALS patients' hemodynamic responses to MI tasks, and to investigate the feasibility of using these responses as a means of communication to control a binary BCI. Hemodynamic responses were recorded using fNIRS from eight patients with ALS while performing MI-Rest tasks. The generalized linear model (GLM) analysis was conducted to statistically estimate and evaluate individualized spatial activation. Selected channel sets were statistically optimized for classification. Subject-specific discriminative features, including a proposed data-driven estimated coefficient obtained from GLM, and optimized classification parameters were identified and used to further evaluate the performance using a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Inter-subject variations were observed in spatio-temporal characteristics of patients' hemodynamic responses. Using optimized classification parameters and feature sets, all subjects could successfully use their MI hemodynamic responses to control a BCI with an average classification accuracy of 85.4% ± 9.8%. Our results indicate a promising application of fNIRS-based MI hemodynamic responses to control a binary BCI by ALS patients. These findings highlight the importance of subject-specific data-driven approaches for identifying discriminative spatio-temporal characteristics for an optimized BCI performance."

However, a portion of individuals was unable to operate BCI with high efficacy. This research aimed to study the brain-wide functional connectivity differences that contributed to BCI performance, and investigate the relationship between task-related connectivity strength and BCI performance. Functional connectivity was estimated using pairwise Pearson's correlation from the EEG of 48 subjects performing left or right hand motor imagery (MI) tasks. The classification accuracy of linear support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish both tasks were used to represent MI-BCI performance. The significant differences in connectivity strengths were examined using Welch's T-test. The association between accuracy and connection strength was studied using correlation model. Three intralobular and fourteen interlobular connections from the parietal lobe showed a correlation of 0.31 and -0.34 respectively. Results indicate that alpha wave connectivity from 8 Hz to 13 Hz was more related to classification performance compared to high-frequency waves. Subject-independent trial-based analysis shows that MI trials executed with stronger intralobular and interlobular parietal connections performed significantly better than trials with weaker connections. Further investigation from an independent MI dataset reveals several similar connections that were correlated with MI-BCI performance. The functional connectivity of the parietal lobe could potentially allow prediction of MI-BCI performance and enable implementation of neurofeedback training for users to improve the usability of MI-BCI."

BCI combined with other techniques such as Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) and Virtual Reality (VR) allows to the user restore the neurological function by inducing the neural plasticity through improved real-time detection of motor imagery (MI) as patients perform therapy tasks. Fifty-one stroke patients with upper extremity hemiparesis were recruited for this study. All participants performed 25 sessions with the MI BCI and assessment visits to track the functional changes before and after the therapy. The results of this study demonstrated a significant increase in the motor function of the paretic arm assessed by Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-UE), ΔFMA-UE = 4.68 points, <i>P</i> < 0.001, reduction of the spasticity in the wrist and fingers assessed by Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), ΔMAS-wrist = -0.72 points (<i>SD</i> = 0.83), <i>P</i> < 0.001, ΔMAS-fingers = -0.63 points (<i>SD</i> = 0.82), <i>P</i> < 0.001. Other significant improvements in the grasp ability were detected in the healthy hand. All these functional improvements achieved during the BCI therapy persisted 6 months after the therapy ended. Results also showed that patients with Motor Imagery accuracy (MI) above 80% increase 3.16 points more in the FMA than patients below this threshold (95% CI; [1.47-6.62], <i>P</i> = 0.003). The functional improvement was not related with the stroke severity or with the stroke stage. The BCI treatment used here was effective in promoting long lasting functional improvements in the upper extremity in stroke survivors with severe, moderate and mild impairment.

How to optimally select channels and extract associated features remains a big challenge. This study aims to propose and validate a deep learning-based approach to automatically recognize two different MI states by selecting the relevant EEG channels.<i>Approach.</i>In this work, we make use of a sparse squeeze-and-excitation module to extract the weights of EEG channels based on their contribution to MI classification, by which an automatic channel selection (ACS) strategy is developed. Further, we propose a convolutional neural network to fully exploit the time-frequency features, thus outperforming traditional classification methods both in terms of accuracy and robustness.<i>Main results.</i>We execute the experiments using EEG signals recorded at MI where 25 healthy subjects performed MI movements of the right hand and feet to generate motor commands. An average accuracy of87.2±5.0% (mean±std)is obtained, providing a 37.3% improvement with respect to a state-of-the-art channel selection approach.<i>Significance.</i>The proposed ACS method has been found to be significantly advantageous compared to the typical approach of using a fixed channel configuration. This work shows that fewer EEG channels not only reduces computational complexity but also improves the MI classification performance. The proposed method selects EEG channels related to hand and feet movement, which paves the way to real-time and more natural interfaces between the patient and the robotic device."
33175681,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding helps motor-disabled patients to communicate with external devices directly, which can achieve the purpose of human-computer interaction and assisted living. MI EEG decoding has a core problem which is extracting as many multiple types of features as possible from the multi-channel time series of EEG to understand brain activity accurately. Recently, deep learning technology has been widely used in EEG decoding. However, the variability of the simple network framework is insufficient to satisfy the complex task of EEG decoding. A multi-scale fusion convolutional neural network based on the attention mechanism (MS-AMF) is proposed in this paper. The network extracts spatio temporal multi-scale features from multi-brain regions representation signals and is supplemented by a dense fusion strategy to retain the maximum information flow. The attention mechanism we added to the network has improved the sensitivity of the network. The experimental results show that the network has a better classification effect compared with the baseline method in the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset. We conducted visualization analysis in multiple parts of the network, and the results show that the attention mechanism is also convenient for analyzing the underlying information flow of EEG decoding, which verifies the effectiveness of the MS-AMF method."
33157470,"The input data distributions of EEG-based BCI systems can change during intra-session transitions due to nonstationarity caused by features covariate shifts, thus compromising BCI performance. We aimed to identify the most robust spatial filtering approach, among most used methods, testing them on calibration dataset, and test dataset recorded 30 min afterwards. In addition, we also investigated if their performance improved after application of Stationary Subspace Analysis (SSA). We have recorded, in 17 healthy subjects, the calibration set at the beginning of the upper limb motor imagery BCI experiment and testing set separately 30 min afterwards. Both the calibration and test data were pre-processed and the BCI models were produced by using several spatial filtering approaches on the calibration set. Those models were subsequently evaluated on a test set. The differences between the accuracy estimated by cross-validation on the calibration dataset and the accuracy on the test dataset were investigated. The same procedure was performed with, and without SSA pre-processing step. A significant reduction in accuracy on the test dataset was observed for CSP, SPoC and SpecRCSP approaches. For SLap and SpecCSP only a slight decreasing trend was observed, while FBCSP and FBCSPT largely maintained moderately high median accuracy >70%. In the case of application of SSA pre-processing, the differences between accuracy observed on calibration and test dataset were reduced. In addition, accuracy values both on calibration and test set were slightly higher in case of SSA pre-processing and also in this case FBCSP and FBCSPT presented slightly better performance compared to other methods. The intrinsic signal nonstationarity characteristics, caused by covariance shifts of power features, reduced the accuracy of BCI model, therefore, suggesting that this evaluation framework should be considered for testing and simulating real life performance. FBCSP and FBSCPT approaches showed to be more robust to feature covariance shift. SSA can improve the models performance and reduce accuracy decline from calibration to test set."
33126130,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) are commonly used for control applications. However, these applications require strong and discriminant neural patterns for which extensive experience in MI may be necessary. Inspired by the field of rehabilitation where embodiment is a key element for improving cortical activity, our study proposes a novel control scheme in which virtually embodiable feedback is provided during control to enhance performance. Subjects underwent two immersive virtual reality control scenarios in which they controlled the two-dimensional movement of a device using electroencephalography (EEG). The two scenarios only differ on whether embodiable feedback, which mirrors the movement of the classified intention, is provided. After undergoing each scenario, subjects also answered a questionnaire in which they rated how immersive the scenario and embodiable the feedback were. Subjects exhibited higher control performance, greater discriminability in brain activity patterns, and enhanced cortical activation when using our control scheme compared to the standard control scheme in which embodiable feedback is absent. Moreover, the self-rated embodiment and presence scores showed significantly positive linear relationships with performance. The findings in our study provide evidence that providing embodiable feedback as guidance on how intention is classified may be effective for control applications by inducing enhanced neural activity and patterns with greater discriminability. By applying embodiable feedback to immersive virtual reality, our study also serves as another instance in which virtual reality is shown to be a promising tool for improving MI."
33100985,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can provide independent information exchange and control channels for the brain and the outside world. However, EEG signals come from multiple electrodes, the data of which can generate multiple features. How to select electrodes and features to improve classification performance has become an urgent problem to be solved. This paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) structure with separated temporal and spatial filters, which selects the raw EEG signals of the electrode pairs over the motor cortex region as hybrid samples without any preprocessing or artificial feature extraction operations. In the proposed structure, a 5-layer CNN has been applied to learn EEG features, a 4-layer max pooling has been used to reduce dimensionality, and a fully-connected (FC) layer has been utilized for classification. Dropout and batch normalization are also employed to reduce the risk of overfitting. In the experiment, the 4 s EEG data of 10, 20, 60, and 100 subjects from the Physionet database are used as the data source, and the motor imaginations (MI) tasks are divided into four types: left fist, right fist, both fists, and both feet. The results indicate that the global averaged accuracy on group-level classification can reach 97.28%, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve stands out at 0.997, and the electrode pair with the highest accuracy on 10 subjects dataset is FC3-FC4, with 98.61%. The research results also show that this CNN classification method with minimal (2) electrode can obtain high accuracy, which is an advantage over other methods on the same database. This proposed approach provides a new idea for simplifying the design of BCI systems, and accelerates the process of clinical application."
33100953,"Inter-subject transfer learning is a long-standing problem in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and has not yet been fully realized due to high inter-subject variability in the brain signals related to motor imagery (MI). The recent success of deep learning-based algorithms in classifying different brain signals warrants further exploration to determine whether it is feasible for the inter-subject continuous decoding of MI signals to provide contingent neurofeedback which is important for neurorehabilitative BCI designs. In this paper, we have shown how a convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning framework can be used for inter-subject continuous decoding of MI related electroencephalographic (EEG) signals using the novel concept of Mega Blocks for adapting the network against inter-subject variabilities. These Mega Blocks have the capacity to repeat a specific architectural block several times such as one or more convolutional layers in a single Mega Block. The parameters of such Mega Blocks can be optimized using Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. The results, obtained on the publicly available BCI competition IV-2b dataset, yields an average inter-subject continuous decoding accuracy of 71.49% (κ = 0.42) and 70.84% (κ = 0.42) for two different training methods such as adaptive moment estimation (Adam) and stochastic gradient descent (SGDM), respectively, in 7 out of 9 subjects. Our results show for the first time that it is feasible to use CNN based architectures for inter-subject continuous decoding with a sufficient level of accuracy for developing calibration-free MI-BCIs for practical purposes."
33092554,"Training with brain-computer interface (BCI) technology in the rehabilitation of patients after a stroke is rapidly developing. Numerous RCT investigated the effects of BCI training (BCIT) on recovery of motor and brain function in patients after stroke. A systematic literature search was performed in Medline, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Cochrane library, and Embase in July 2018 and was repeated in March 2019. RCT or controlled clinical trials that included BCIT for improving motor and brain recovery in patients after a stroke were identified. Data were meta-analysed using the random-effects model. Standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence (95%CI) and 95% prediction interval (95%PI) were calculated. A meta-regression was performed to evaluate the effects of covariates on the pooled effect-size. In total, 14 studies, including 362 patients after ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (cortical, subcortical, 121 females; mean age 53.0+/- 5.8; mean time since stroke onset 15.7+/- 18.2 months) were included. Main motor recovery outcome measure used was the Fugl-Meyer Assessment. Quantitative analysis showed that a BCI training compared to conventional therapy alone in patients after stroke was effective with an SMD of 0.39 (95%CI: 0.17 to 0.62; 95%PI of 0.13 to 0.66) for motor function recovery of the upper extremity. An SMD of 0.41 (95%CI: - 0.29 to 1.12) for motor function recovery of the lower extremity was found. BCI training enhanced brain function recovery with an SMD of 1.11 (95%CI: 0.64 to 1.59; 95%PI ranging from 0.33 to 1.89). Covariates such as training duration, impairment level of the upper extremity, and the combination of both did not show significant effects on the overall pooled estimate. This meta-analysis showed evidence that BCI training added to conventional therapy may enhance motor functioning of the upper extremity and brain function recovery in patients after a stroke. We recommend a standardised evaluation of motor imagery ability of included patients and the assessment of brain function recovery should consider neuropsychological aspects (attention, concentration). Further influencing factors on motor recovery due to BCI technology might consider factors such as age, lesion type and location, quality of performance of motor imagery, or neuropsychological aspects.

33049729,"<i>Objective.</i>The goal of this work is to identify the spatio-temporal facets of state-of-the-art electroencephalography (EEG)-based continuous neurorobotics that need to be addressed, prior to deployment in practical applications at home and in the clinic.<i>Approach.</i>Nine healthy human subjects participated in five sessions of one-dimensional (1D) horizontal (LR), 1D vertical (UD) and two-dimensional (2D) neural tracking from EEG. Users controlled a robotic arm and virtual cursor to continuously track a Gaussian random motion target using EEG sensorimotor rhythm modulation via motor imagery (MI) commands. Continuous control quality was analyzed in the temporal and spatial domains separately.<i>Main results.</i>Axis-specific errors during 2D tasks were significantly larger than during 1D counterparts. Fatigue rates were larger for control tasks with higher cognitive demand (LR, left- and right-hand MI) compared to those with lower cognitive demand (UD, both hands MI and rest). Additionally robotic arm and virtual cursor control exhibited equal tracking error during all tasks. However, further spatial error analysis of 2D control revealed a significant reduction in tracking quality that was dependent on the visual interference of the physical device. In fact, robotic arm performance was significantly greater than that of virtual cursor control when the users' sightlines were not obstructed.<i>Significance.</i>This work emphasizes the need for practical interfaces to be designed around real-world tasks of increased complexity. Here, the dependence of control quality on cognitive task demand emphasizes the need for decoders that facilitate the translation of 1D task mastery to 2D control. When device footprint was accounted for, the introduction of a physical robotic arm improved control quality, likely due to increased user engagement. In general, this work demonstrates the need to consider both the physical footprint of devices, the complexity of training tasks, and the synergy of control strategies during the development of neurorobotic control."
33045685,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology based on motor imagery (MI) control has become a research hotspot but continues to encounter numerous challenges. BCI can assist in the recovery of stroke patients and serve as a key technology in robot control. Current research on MI almost exclusively focuses on the hands, feet, and tongue. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to establish a four-class MI BCI system, in which the four types are the four articulations within the right upper limbs, involving the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand. Ten subjects were chosen to perform nine upper-limb analytic movements, after which the differences were compared in P300, movement-related potentials(MRPS), and event-related desynchronization/event-related synchronization under voluntary MI (V-MI) and involuntary MI (INV-MI). Next, the cross-frequency coupling (CFC) coefficient based on mutual information was extracted from the electrodes and frequency bands with interest. Combined with the image Fourier transform and twin bounded support vector machine classifier, four kinds of electroencephalography data were classified, and the classifier's parameters were optimized using a genetic algorithm. The results were shown to be encouraging, with an average accuracy of 93.2% and 92.2% for V-MI and INV-MI, respectively, and over 95% for any three classes and any two classes. In most cases, the accuracy of feature extraction using the proximal articulations as the basis was found to be relatively high and had better performance. This paper discussed four types of MI according to three aspects under two modes and classed them by combining graph Fourier transform and CFC. Accordingly, the theoretical discussion and classification methods may provide a fundamental theoretical basis for BCI interface applications."
33034634,"Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been developed for realizing natural bi-directional interaction between users and external robotic systems. However, the communication between users and BCI systems through artificial matching is a critical issue. Recently, BCIs have been developed to adopt intuitive decoding, which is the key to solving several problems such as a small number of classes and manually matching BCI commands with device control. Unfortunately, the advances in this area have been slow owing to the lack of large and uniform datasets. This study provides a large intuitive dataset for 11 different upper extremity movement tasks obtained during multiple recording sessions. The dataset includes 60-channel electroencephalography, 7-channel electromyography, and 4-channel electro-oculography of 25 healthy participants collected over 3-day sessions for a total of 82,500 trials across all the participants. We validated our dataset via neurophysiological analysis. We observed clear sensorimotor de-/activation and spatial distribution related to real-movement and motor imagery, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated the consistency of the dataset by evaluating the classification performance of each session using a baseline machine learning method. The dataset includes the data of multiple recording sessions, various classes within the single upper extremity, and multimodal signals. This work can be used to (i) compare the brain activities associated with real movement and imagination, (ii) improve the decoding performance, and (iii) analyze the differences among recording sessions. Hence, this study, as a Data Note, has focused on collecting data required for further advances in the BCI technology."
33020435,"Motor Imagery (MI) promotes motor learning in activities, like developing professional motor skills, sports gestures, and patient rehabilitation. However, up to 30% of users may not develop enough coordination skills after training sessions because of inter and intra-subject variability. Here, we develop a data-driven estimator, termed Deep Regression Network (DRN), which jointly extracts and performs the regression analysis in order to assess the efficiency of the individual brain networks in practicing MI tasks. The proposed double-stage estimator initially learns a pool of deep patterns, extracted from the input data, in order to feed a neural regression model, allowing for infering the distinctiveness between subject assemblies having similar variability. The results, which were obtained on real-world MI data, prove that the DRN estimator fosters pre-training neural desynchronization and initial training synchronization to predict the bi-class accuracy response, thus providing a better understanding of the Brain-Computer Interface inefficiency of subjects."

33018888,"The purpose of this study was to discriminate between left- and right-hand motor imagery tasks. We recorded the brain signals from two participants using a fNIRS system and compared different feature extraction (mean, peak, minimum, skewness and kurtosis) and classification techniques (linear (LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression, K-nearest-neighbor (KNN), and neural networks with Levenberg-Marquardt (LMA), Bayesian Regularization (BRANN) and Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCGA) training algorithms). The results showed poor classification accuracies (<; 58%) when skewness and kurtosis were used. When mean, peak, and minimum were used as features, QDA, SVM and KNN produced higher classification accuracies relative to LDA and logistic regression. Overall, BRANN led to the highest accuracies (>98%) when mean, peak and minimum were used as features."
33018651,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable communication by interpreting the user intent based on measured brain electrical activity. Such interpretation is usually performed by supervised classifiers constructed in training sessions. However, changes in cognitive states of the user, such as alertness and vigilance, during test sessions lead to variations in EEG patterns, causing classification performance decline in BCI systems. This research focuses on effects of alertness on the performance of motor imagery (MI) BCI as a common mental control paradigm. It proposes a new protocol to predict MI performance decline by alertness-related pre-trial spatio-spectral EEG features. The proposed protocol can be used for adapting the classifier or restoring alertness based on the cognitive state of the user during BCI applications."
33018650,"The study reports the performance of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients to operate Motor-Imagery based Brain-Computer Interface (MI-BCI) and compares three selected pre-processing and classification approaches. The experiment was conducted on 7 PD patients who performed a total of 14 MI-BCI sessions targeting lower extremities. EEG was recorded during the initial calibration phase of each session, and the specific BCI models were produced by using Spectrally weighted Common Spatial Patterns (SpecCSP), Source Power Comodulation (SPoC) and Filter-Bank Common Spatial Patterns (FBCSP) methods. The results showed that FBCSP outperformed SPoC in terms of accuracy, and both SPoC and SpecCSP in terms of the false-positive ratio. The study also demonstrates that PD patients were capable of operating MI-BCI, although with lower accuracy."
33018646,"The success of deep learning (DL) methods in the Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) field for classification of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings has been restricted by the lack of large datasets. Privacy concerns associated with EEG signals limit the possibility of constructing a large EEG-BCI dataset by the conglomeration of multiple small ones for jointly training machine learning models. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving DL architecture named federated transfer learning (FTL) for EEG classification that is based on the federated learning framework. Working with the single-trial covariance matrix, the proposed architecture extracts common discriminative information from multi-subject EEG data with the help of domain adaptation techniques. We evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture on the PhysioNet dataset for 2-class motor imagery classification. While avoiding the actual data sharing, our FTL approach achieves 2% higher classification accuracy in a subject-adaptive analysis. Also, in the absence of multi-subject data, our architecture provides 6% better accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art DL architectures."
33018640,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) based braincomputer interface (BCI) systems are useful tools for clinical purposes like neural prostheses. In this study, we collected EEG signals related to grasp motions. Five healthy subjects participated in this experiment. They executed and imagined five sustained-grasp actions. We proposed a novel data augmentation method that increases the amount of training data using labels obtained from electromyogram (EMG) signals analysis. For implementation, we recorded EEG and EMG simultaneously. The data augmentation over the original EEG data concluded higher classification accuracy than other competitors. As a result, we obtained the average classification accuracy of 52.49(±8.74)% for motor execution (ME) and 40.36(±3.39)% for motor imagery (MI). These are 9.30% and 6.19% higher, respectively than the result of the comparable methods. Moreover, the proposed method could minimize the need for the calibration session, which reduces the practicality of most BCIs. This result is encouraging, and the proposed method could potentially be used in future applications such as a BCI-driven robot control for handling various daily use objects."
33018634,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) data during motor imagery tasks regarding small-scale physical dynamics such as finger motions have low discriminability because capturing the spatial difference of the motions is difficult. We assumed that more discriminative features can be captured if spatial filters maximize the independence of each class data. This study constructed spatial filters named multiclass common spatial pattern (CSP), which maximize an approximation of mutual in-formation of extracted components and class labels, and applied them to a five-class motor-imagery dataset containing finger motion tasks. By applying multiclass CSP, the classification accuracies were improved (Mean SD: 40.6 ± 10.1%) compared with classical CSP (21.8 ± 2.5%) and no spatial filtering case (38.7±10.0%). In addition, we visualized learned spatial filters to assess the trend of discriminative features of finger motions. For these results, it was clear that multiclass CSP captured task-specific spatial maps for each finger motion and outperformed multiclass motor-imagery classification performance about 2% even when the tasks are small-scale physical dynamics."
33018631,"A large amount of calibration data is typically needed to train an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) due to the non-stationary nature of EEG data. This paper proposes a novel weighted transfer learning algorithm using a dynamic time warping (DTW) based alignment method to alleviate this need by using data from other subjects. DTW-based alignment is first applied to reduce the temporal variations between a specific subject data and the transfer learning data from other subjects. Next, similarity is measured using Kullback Leibler divergence (KL) between the DTW aligned data and the specific subject data. The other subjects' data are then weighted based on their KL similarity to each trials of the specific subject data. This weighted data from other subjects are then used to train the BCI model of the specific subject. An experiment was performed on publicly available BCI Competition IV dataset 2a. The proposed algorithm yielded an average improvement of 9% compared to a subject-specific BCI model trained with 4 trials, and the results yielded an average improvement of 10% compared to naive transfer learning. Overall, the proposed DTW-aligned KL weighted transfer learning algorithm show promise to alleviate the need of large amount of calibration data by using only a short calibration data."
33018625,"Accurate and robust classification of Motor Imagery (MI) from Electroencephalography (EEG) signals is among the most challenging tasks in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) field. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel, neuro-physiologically inspired convolutional neural network (CNN) named Filter-Bank Convolutional Network (FBCNet) for MI classification. Capturing neurophysiological signatures of MI, FBCNet first creates a multi-view representation of the data by bandpass-filtering the EEG into multiple frequency bands. Next, spatially discriminative patterns for each view are learned using a CNN layer. Finally, the temporal information is aggregated using a new variance layer and a fully connected layer classifies the resultant features into MI classes. We evaluate the performance of FBCNet on a publicly available dataset from Korea University for classification of left vs right hand MI in a subject-specific 10-fold cross-validation setting. Results show that FBCNet achieves more than 6.7% higher accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning architectures while requiring less than 1% of the learning parameters. We explain the higher classification accuracy achieved by FBCNet using feature visualization where we show the superiority of FBCNet in learning interpretable and highly generalizable discriminative features.

33018605,"The goal of this paper is to investigate whether motor imagery tasks, performed under pain-free versus pain conditions, can be discriminated from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Four motor imagery classes of right hand, left hand, foot, and tongue are considered. A functional connectivity-based feature extraction approach along with a long short-term memory (LSTM) classifier are employed for classifying pain-free versus under-pain classes. Moreover, classification is performed in different frequency bands to study the significance of each band in differentiating motor imagery data associated with pain-free and under-pain states. When considering all frequency bands, the average classification accuracy is in the range of 77:86-80:04%. Our frequency-specific analysis shows that the gamma band results in a notably higher accuracy than other bands, indicating the importance of this band in discriminating pain/no-pain conditions during the execution of motor imagery tasks. In contrast, functional connectivity graphs extracted from delta and theta bands do not seem to provide discriminatory information between pain-free and under-pain conditions. This is the first study demonstrating that motor imagery tasks executed under pain and without pain conditions can be discriminated from EEG recordings. Our findings can provide new insights for developing effective brain computer interface-based assistive technologies for patients who are in real need of them."
33018041,"Recently, there is an increasing recognition that sensory feedback is critical for proper motor control. With the help of BCI, people with motor disabilities can communicate with their environments or control things around them by using signals extracted directly from the brain. The widely used non-invasive EEG based BCI system require that the brain signals are first preprocessed, and then translated into significant features that could be converted into commands for external control. To determine the appropriate information from the acquired brain signals is a major challenge for a reliable classification accuracy due to high data dimensions. The feature selection approach is a feasible technique to solving this problem, however, an effective selection method for determining the best set of features that would yield a significant classification performance has not yet been established for motor imagery (MI) based BCI. This paper explored the effectiveness of bio-inspired algorithms (BIA) such as Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA), and Modified Particle Swarm Optimization (M-PSO) on EEG and ECoG data. The performance of SVM classifier showed that M-PSO is highly efficacious with the least selected feature (SF), and converges at an acceptable speed in low iterations."

33018023,"Motivated by the inconceivable capability of human brain in simultaneously processing multi-modal signals and its real-time feedback to the outer world events, there has been a surge of interest in establishing a communication bridge between the human brain and a computer, which are referred to as Brain-computer Interfaces (BCI). To this aim, monitoring the electrical activity of brain through Electroencephalogram (EEG) has emerged as the prime choice for BCI systems. To discover the underlying and specific features of brain signals for different mental tasks, a considerable number of research works are developed based on statistical and data-driven techniques. However, a major bottleneck in development of practical and commercial BCI systems is their limited performance when the number of mental tasks for classification is increased. In this work, we propose a new EEG processing and feature extraction paradigm based on Siamese neural networks, which can be conveniently merged and scaled up for multi-class problems. The idea of Siamese networks is to train a double-input neural network based on a contrastive loss-function, which provides the capability of verifying if two input EEG trials are from the same class or not. In this work, a Siamese architecture, which is developed based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and provides a binary output on the similarity of two inputs, is combined with One vs. Rest (OVR) and One vs. One (OVO) techniques to scale up for multi-class problems. The efficacy of this architecture is evaluated on a 4-class Motor Imagery (MI) dataset from BCI Competition IV<sub>2a</sub> and the results suggest a promising performance compared to its counterparts."
33017963,"We have uncovered serious flaws in handling EEG signals with a decreased rank in implementations of the common spatial patterns (CSP). The CSP algorithm assumes covariance matrices of the signal to have full rank. However, preprocessing techniques, such as artifact removal using independent component analysis, may decrease the rank of the signal, leading to potential errors in the CSP decomposition. We inspect what could go wrong when CSP implementations do not take this into consideration on a binary motor imagery classification task. We review CSP implementations in open-source toolboxes for EEG signal analysis (FieldTrip, BBCI Toolbox, BioSig, EEGLAB, BCILAB, and MNE). We show that unprotected implementations decreased mean classification accuracy by up to 32%, with spatial filters resulting in complex numbers, for which corresponding spatial patterns do not have a clear interpretation. We encourage researchers to check their implementations and analysis pipelines."
33017962,"The brain-computer interface (BCI) based on electroencephalography (EEG) converts the subject's intentions into control signals. For the BCI, the study of motor imagery has been widely used. In recent years, a classification method based on a convolutional neural network (CNNs) has been proposed. However, most of the existing methods use a single convolution scale on CNN, and another problem that affects the results is limited training data. To solve these problems, we propose a mixed-scale CNN architecture, and a data augmentation method is used to classify the EEG of motor imagery. After classifying the BCI competition IV dataset 2b, the average classification accuracy is 81.52%. Compared with the existing methods, our method has a better classification result. This method effectively solves the problems existing in the existing CNN-based motor imagery classification methods, and it improves the classification accuracy."
33017946,"In this paper the classification of motor imagery brain signals is addressed. The innovative idea is to use both temporal and spatial knowledge of the input data to increase the performance. Definitely, the electrode locations on the scalp is as important as the acquired temporal signals from every individual electrode. In order to incorporate this knowledge, a deep neural network is employed in this work. Both motor-imagery EEG and bi-modal EEG-fNIRS datasets were used for this purpose. The results are compared for different scenarios and using different methods. The achieved results are promising and imply that combining both temporal and spatial information of the brain signals could be really effective and increases the performance."
33014987,"Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) can improve the control of assistance mobility devices making its use more intuitive and natural. In the case of an exoskeleton, they can also help rehabilitation therapies due to the reinforcement of neuro-plasticity through repetitive motor actions and cognitive engagement of the subject. Therefore, the cognitive implication of the user is a key aspect in BMI applications, and it is important to assure that the mental task correlates with the actual motor action. However, the process of walking is usually an autonomous mental task that requires a minimal conscious effort. Consequently, a brain-machine interface focused on the attention to gait could facilitate sensory integration in individuals with neurological impairment through the analysis of voluntary gait will and its repetitive use. This way the combined use of BMI+exoskeleton turns from assistance to restoration. This paper presents a new brain-machine interface based on the decoding of gamma band activity and attention level during motor imagery mental tasks. This work also shows a case study tested in able-bodied subjects prior to a future clinical study, demonstrating that a BMI based on gamma band and attention-level paradigm allows real-time closed-loop control of a Rex exoskeleton."
32998113,"Magnetoencephalography (MEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) involves a large number of sensors allowing better spatiotemporal resolution for assessing brain activity patterns. There have been many efforts to develop BCI using MEG with high accuracy, though an increase in the number of channels (NoC) means an increase in computational complexity. However, not all sensors necessarily contribute significantly to an increase in classification accuracy (CA) and specifically in the case of MEG-based BCI no channel selection methodology has been performed. Therefore, this study investigates the effect of channel selection on the performance of MEG-based BCI. MEG data were recorded for two sessions from 15 healthy participants performing motor imagery, cognitive imagery and a mixed imagery task pair using a unique paradigm. Performance of four state-of-the-art channel selection methods (i.e. Class-Correlation, ReliefF, Random Forest, and Infinite Latent Feature Selection were applied across six binary tasks in three different frequency bands) were evaluated in this study on two state-of-the-art features, i.e. bandpower and common spatial pattern (CSP). All four methods provided a statistically significant increase in CA compared to a baseline method using all gradiometer sensors, i.e. 204 channels with band-power features from alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), or broadband (α + β) (8-30 Hz). It is also observed that the alpha frequency band performed better than the beta and broadband frequency bands. The performance of the beta band gave the lowest CA compared with the other two bands. Channel selection improved accuracy irrespective of feature types. Moreover, all the methods reduced the NoC significantly, from 204 to a range of 1-25, using bandpower as a feature and from 15 to 105 for CSP. The optimal channel number also varied not only in each session but also for each participant. Reducing the NoC will help to decrease the computational cost and maintain numerical stability in cases of low trial numbers. The study showed significant improvement in performance of MEG-BCI with channel selection irrespective of feature type and hence can be successfully applied for BCI applications."
32986556,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) translates human intentions into computer commands by recognizing the electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns of different imagination tasks. However, due to the scarcity of MI commands and the long calibration time, using the MI-based BCI system in practice is still challenging. Zero-shot learning (ZSL), which can recognize objects whose instances may not have been seen during training, has the potential to substantially reduce the calibration time. Thus, in this context, we first try to use a new type of motor imagery task, which is a combination of traditional tasks and propose a novel zero-shot learning model that can recognize both known and unknown categories of EEG signals. This is achieved by first learning a non-linear projection from EEG features to the target space and then applying a novelty detection method to differentiate unknown classes from known classes. Applications to a dataset collected from nine subjects confirm the possibility of identifying a new type of motor imagery only using already obtained motor imagery data. Results indicate that the classification accuracy of our zero-shot based method accounts for 91.81% of the traditional method which uses all categories of data."
32973672,"<b>Introduction:</b> Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to modulate cortical plasticity, enhance motor learning and post-stroke upper extremity motor recovery. It has also been demonstrated to facilitate activation of brain-computer interface (BCI) in stroke patients. We had previously demonstrated that BCI-assisted motor imagery (MI-BCI) can improve upper extremity impairment in chronic stroke participants. This study was carried out to investigate the effects of priming with tDCS prior to MI-BCI training in chronic stroke patients with moderate to severe upper extremity paresis and to investigate the cortical activity changes associated with training. <b>Methods:</b> This is a double-blinded randomized clinical trial. Participants were randomized to receive 10 sessions of 20-min 1 mA tDCS or sham-tDCS before MI-BCI, with the anode applied to the ipsilesional, and the cathode to the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1). Upper extremity sub-scale of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (UE-FM) and corticospinal excitability measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were assessed before, after and 4 weeks after intervention. <b>Results:</b> Ten participants received real tDCS and nine received sham tDCS. UE-FM improved significantly in both groups after intervention. Of those with unrecordable motor evoked potential (MEP-) to the ipsilesional M1, significant improvement in UE-FM was found in the real-tDCS group, but not in the sham group. Resting motor threshold (RMT) of ipsilesional M1 decreased significantly after intervention in the real-tDCS group. Short intra-cortical inhibition (SICI) in the contralesional M1 was reduced significantly following intervention in the sham group. Correlation was found between baseline UE-FM score and changes in the contralesional SICI for all, as well as between changes in UE-FM and changes in contralesional RMT in the MEP- group. <b>Conclusion:</b> MI-BCI improved the motor function of the stroke-affected arm in chronic stroke patients with moderate to severe impairment. tDCS did not confer overall additional benefit although there was a trend toward greater benefit. Cortical activity changes in the contralesional M1 associated with functional improvement suggests a possible role for the contralesional M1 in stroke recovery in more severely affected patients. This has important implications in designing neuromodulatory interventions for future studies and tailoring treatment. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> The study was registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01897025)."
32973481,"The use of brain-machine interfaces in combination with robotic exoskeletons is usually based on the analysis of the changes in power that some brain rhythms experience during a motion event. However, this variation in power is frequently obtained through frequency filtering and power estimation using the Fourier analysis.

32956061,"Motor imagery (MI) decoding is an important part of brain-computer interface (BCI) research, which translates the subject's intentions into commands that external devices can execute. The traditional methods for discriminative feature extraction, such as common spatial pattern (CSP) and filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP), have only focused on the energy features of the electroencephalography (EEG) and thus ignored the further exploration of temporal information. However, the temporal information of spatially filtered EEG may be critical to the performance improvement of MI decoding. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning approach termed filter-bank spatial filtering and temporal-spatial convolutional neural network (FBSF-TSCNN) for MI decoding, where the FBSF block transforms the raw EEG signals into an appropriate intermediate EEG presentation, and then the TSCNN block decodes the intermediate EEG signals. Moreover, a novel stage-wise training strategy is proposed to mitigate the difficult optimization problem of the TSCNN block in the case of insufficient training samples. Firstly, the feature extraction layers are trained by optimization of the triplet loss. Then, the classification layers are trained by optimization of the cross-entropy loss. Finally, the entire network (TSCNN) is fine-tuned by the back-propagation (BP) algorithm. Experimental evaluations on the BCI IV 2a and SMR-BCI datasets reveal that the proposed stage-wise training strategy yields significant performance improvement compared with the conventional end-to-end training strategy, and the proposed approach is comparable with the state-of-the-art method."
32947766,"The development of fast and robust brain-computer interface (BCI) systems requires non-complex and efficient computational tools. The modern procedures adopted for this purpose are complex which limits their use in practical applications. In this study, for the first time, and to the best of our knowledge, a successive decomposition index (SDI)-based feature extraction approach is utilized for the classification of motor and mental imagery electroencephalography (EEG) tasks. First of all, the public datasets IVa, IVb, and V from BCI competition III were denoised using multiscale principal analysis (MSPCA), and then a SDI feature was calculated corresponding to each trial of the data. Finally, six benchmark machine learning and neural network classifiers were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. All the experiments were performed for motor and mental imagery datasets in binary and multiclass applications using a 10-fold cross-validation method. Furthermore, computerized automatic detection of motor and mental imagery using SDI (CADMMI-SDI) is developed to describe the proposed approach practically. The experimental results suggest that the highest classification accuracy of 97.46% (Dataset IVa), 99.52% (Dataset IVb), and 99.33% (Dataset V) was obtained using feedforward neural network classifier. Moreover, a series of experiments, namely, statistical analysis, channels variation, classifier parameters variation, processed and unprocessed data, and computational complexity, were performed and it was concluded that SDI is robust for noise, and a non-complex and efficient biomarker for the development of fast and accurate motor and mental imagery BCI systems."
32923476,"A hybrid brain computer interface (BCI) system considered here is a combination of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). EEG-fNIRS signals are simultaneously recorded to achieve high motor imagery task classification. This integration helps to achieve better system performance, but at the cost of an increase in system complexity and computational time. In hybrid BCI studies, channel selection is recognized as the key element that directly affects the system's performance. In this paper, we propose a novel channel selection approach using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, where only highly correlated channels are selected from each hemisphere. Then, four different statistical features are extracted, and their different combinations are used for the classification through KNN and Tree classifiers. As far as we know, there is no report available that explored the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient for hybrid EEG-fNIRS BCI channel selection. The results demonstrate that our hybrid system significantly reduces computational burden while achieving a classification accuracy with high reliability comparable to the existing literature."
32916675,"Most deep neural networks (DNNs) used as brain computer interfaces (BCI) classifiers are rarely viable for more than one person and are relatively shallow compared to the state-of-the-art in the wider machine learning literature. The goal of this work is to frame these as a unified challenge and reconsider how transfer learning is used to overcome these difficulties. We present two variations of a holistic approach to transfer learning with DNNs for BCI that rely on a deeper network called TIDNet. Our approaches use multiple subjects for training in the interest of creating a more universal classifier that is applicable for new (unseen) subjects. The first approach is purely subject-invariant and the second targets specific subjects, without loss of generality. We use five publicly accessible datasets covering a range of tasks and compare our approaches to state-of-the-art alternatives in detail. We observe that TIDNet in conjunction with our training augmentations is more consistent when compared to shallower baselines, and in some cases exhibits large and significant improvements, for instance motor imagery classification improvements of over 8%. Furthermore, we show that our suggested multi-domain learning (MDL) strategy strongly outperforms simply fine-tuned general models when targeting specific subjects, while remaining more generalizable to still unseen subjects. TIDNet in combination with a data alignment-based training augmentation proves to be a consistent classification approach of single raw trials and can be trained even with the inclusion of corrupted trials. Our MDL strategy calls into question the intuition to fine-tune trained classifiers to new subjects, as it proves simpler and more accurate while remaining general. Furthermore, we show evidence that augmented TIDNet training makes better use of additional subjects, showing continued and greater performance improvement over shallower alternatives, indicating promise for a new subject-invariant paradigm rather than a subject-specific one."
32908576,"In the process of brain-computer interface (BCI), variations across sessions/subjects result in differences in the properties of potential of the brain. This issue may lead to variations in feature distribution of electroencephalogram (EEG) across subjects, which greatly reduces the generalization ability of a classifier. Although subject-dependent (SD) strategy provides a promising way to solve the problem of personalized classification, it cannot achieve expected performance due to the limitation of the amount of data especially for a deep neural network (DNN) classification model. Herein, we propose an instance transfer subject-independent (ITSD) framework combined with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to improve the classification accuracy of the model during motor imagery (MI) task. The proposed framework consists of the following steps. Firstly, an instance transfer learning based on the perceptive Hash algorithm is proposed to measure similarity of spectrogram EEG signals between different subjects. Then, we develop a CNN to decode these signals after instance transfer learning. Next, the performance of classifications by different training strategies (subject-independent- (SI-) CNN, SD-CNN, and ITSD-CNN) are compared. To verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, we evaluate it on the dataset of BCI competition IV-2b. Experiments show that the instance transfer learning can achieve positive instance transfer using a CNN classification model. Among the three different training strategies, the average classification accuracy of ITSD-CNN can achieve 94.7 ± 2.6 and obtain obvious improvement compared with a contrast model (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Compared with other methods proposed in previous research, the framework of ITSD-CNN outperforms the state-of-the-art classification methods with a mean kappa value of 0.664."
32903663,"Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) send commands to a computer using the brain activity registered when a subject imagines-but does not perform-a given movement. However, inconsistent MI-BCI performance occurs in variations of brain signals across subjects and experiments; this is considered to be a significant problem in practical BCI. Moreover, some subjects exhibit a phenomenon referred to as ""BCI-inefficiency,"" in which they are unable to generate brain signals for BCI control. These subjects have significant difficulties in using BCI. The primary goal of this study is to identify the connections of the resting-state network that affect MI performance and predict MI performance using these connections. We used a public database of MI, which includes the results of psychological questionnaires and pre-experimental resting-state taken over two sessions on different days. A dynamic causal model was used to calculate the coupling strengths between brain regions with directionality. Specifically, we investigated the motor network in resting-state, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which performs motor planning. As a result, we observed a significant difference in the connectivity strength from the supplementary motor area to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex between the low- and high-MI performance groups. This coupling, measured in the resting-state, is significantly stronger in the high-MI performance group than the low-MI performance group. The connection strength is positively correlated with MI-BCI performance (Session 1: <i>r</i> = 0.54; Session 2: <i>r</i> = 0.42). We also predicted MI performance using linear regression based on this connection (<i>r-squared</i> = 0.31). The proposed predictors, based on dynamic causal modeling, can develop new strategies for improving BCI performance. These findings can further our understanding of BCI-inefficiency and help BCI users to lower costs and save time."
32870796,"The performance of motor imagery (MI) based Brain-computer interfacing (BCI) is easily affected by noise and redundant information that exists in the multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG). To solve this problem, many temporal and spatial feature based channel selection methods have been proposed. However, temporal and spatial features do not accurately reflect changes in the power of the oscillatory EEG. Thus, spectral features of MI-related EEG signals may be useful for channel selection. Bispectrum analysis is a technique developed for extracting non-linear and non-Gaussian information from non-linear and non-Gaussian signals. The features extracted from bispectrum analysis can provide frequency domain information about the EEG. Therefore, in this study, we propose a bispectrum-based channel selection (BCS) method for MI-based BCI. The proposed method uses the sum of logarithmic amplitudes (SLA) and the first order spectral moment (FOSM) features extracted from bispectrum analysis to select EEG channels without redundant information. Three public BCI competition datasets (BCI competition IV dataset 1, BCI competition III dataset IVa and BCI competition III dataset IIIa) were used to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The results indicate that our BCS method outperforms use of all channels (83.8% vs 69.4%, 86.3% vs 82.9% and 77.8% vs 68.2%, respectively). Furthermore, compared to the other state-of-the-art methods, our BCS method also can achieve significantly better classification accuracies for MI-based BCI (Wilcoxon signed test, p < 0.05)."
32862028,"Mind machine interface (MMI) enables communication with milieu by measuring brain activities. The reliability of MMI systems is highly dependent on the identification of various motor imagery (MI) tasks. Perfect discrimination of brain activities is required to avoid miscommunication. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a scrupulous solution for the development of MMI. Analysis of multi-channel EEG signals increases the burden of computation drastically. The extraction of hidden information from raw EEG signals is difficult due to its complex nature. A signal is needed to be decomposed and classified for the extraction of hidden information from it. But selecting the uniform decomposition and hyperparameters for decomposition and classification of the signal can lead to information loss and misclassification. This paper presents a novel method for identifying right-hand and right-foot MI tasks. The method employs a single-channel adaptive decomposition and EEG signal classification. The multi-cluster unsupervised learning method is employed for the selection of significant channel. Further, flexible variational mode decomposition (F-VMD) is used for the adaptive decomposition of signals. The values of decomposition parameters are selected adaptively following the nature of EEG signals. The value of decomposition parameters is used to decompose the signals into narrow-band modes. Hjorth, entropy and quartile based features are elicited from the modes of F-VMD. These features are classified by using a flexible extreme learning machine (F-ELM). F-ELM selects the hyperparameters and kernel adaptively by reducing the classification error. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by measuring five performance parameters namely accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), Mathew's correlation coefficient (MCC), and F-1 score. An ACC, SEN, SPE, MCC and F-1 score is obtained as 100%, 100%, 100%, 100%, and 1. The performance parameters obtained by the proposed method prove the superiority over other methodologies using the same data-set. The proposed method proved to be promising and efficient with a single channel and two features. This framework can be utilized for the development of a real-time mind-machine interface like robotic arm, wheel chairs, etc."
32842635,"The common spatial pattern (CSP) is a very effective feature extraction method in motor imagery based brain computer interface (BCI), but its performance depends on the selection of the optimal frequency band. Although a lot of research works have been proposed to improve CSP, most of these works have the problems of large computation costs and long feature extraction time. To this end, three new feature extraction methods based on CSP and a new feature selection method based on non-convex log regularization are proposed in this paper. Firstly, EEG signals are spatially filtered by CSP, and then three new feature extraction methods are proposed. We called them CSP-wavelet, CSP-WPD and CSP-FB, respectively. For CSP-Wavelet and CSP-WPD, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) or wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) is used to decompose the spatially filtered signals, and then the energy and standard deviation of the wavelet coefficients are extracted as features. For CSP-FB, the spatially filtered signals are filtered into multiple bands by a filter bank (FB), and then the logarithm of variances of each band are extracted as features. Secondly, a sparse optimization method regularized with a non-convex log function is proposed for the feature selection, which we called LOG, and an optimization algorithm for LOG is given. Finally, ensemble learning is used for secondary feature selection and classification model construction. Combing feature extraction and feature selection methods, a total of three new EEG decoding methods are obtained, namely CSP-Wavelet+LOG, CSP-WPD+LOG, and CSP-FB+LOG. Four public motor imagery datasets are used to verify the performance of the proposed methods. Compared to existing methods, the proposed methods achieved the highest average classification accuracy of 88.86, 83.40, 81.53, and 80.83 in datasets 1-4, respectively. The feature extraction time of CSP-FB is the shortest. The experimental results show that the proposed methods can effectively improve the classification accuracy and reduce the feature extraction time. With comprehensive consideration of classification accuracy and feature extraction time, CSP-FB+LOG has the best performance and can be used for the real-time BCI system."
32841127,"The performance of a classifier in a brain-computer interface (BCI) system is highly dependent on the quality and quantity of training data. Typically, the training data are collected in a laboratory where the users perform tasks in a controlled environment. However, users' attention may be diverted in real-life BCI applications and this may decrease the performance of the classifier. To improve the robustness of the classifier, additional data can be acquired in such conditions, but it is not practical to record electroencephalogram (EEG) data over several long calibration sessions. A potentially time- and cost-efficient solution is artificial data generation. Hence, in this study, we proposed a framework based on the deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs) for generating artificial EEG to augment the training set in order to improve the performance of a BCI classifier. To make a comparative investigation, we designed a motor task experiment with diverted and focused attention conditions. We used an end-to-end deep convolutional neural network for classification between movement intention and rest using the data from 14 subjects. The results from the leave-one subject-out (LOO) classification yielded baseline accuracies of 73.04% for diverted attention and 80.09% for focused attention without data augmentation. Using the proposed DCGANs-based framework for augmentation, the results yielded a significant improvement of 7.32% for diverted attention ( ) and 5.45% for focused attention ( ). In addition, we implemented the method on the data set IVa from BCI competition III to distinguish different motor imagery tasks. The proposed method increased the accuracy by 3.57% ( ). This study shows that using GANs for EEG augmentation can significantly improve BCI performance, especially in real-life applications, whereby users' attention may be diverted."
32833646,"The common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is a well-recognized spatial filtering method for feature extraction in motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, due to the influence of nonstationary in electroencephalography (EEG) and inherent defects of the CSP objective function, the spatial filters, and their corresponding features are not necessarily optimal in the feature space used within CSP. In this work, we design a new feature selection method to address this issue by selecting features based on an improved objective function. Especially, improvements are made in suppressing outliers and discovering features with larger interclass distances. Moreover, a fusion algorithm based on the Dempster-Shafer theory is proposed, which takes into consideration the distribution of features. With two competition data sets, we first evaluate the performance of the improved objective functions in terms of classification accuracy, feature distribution, and embeddability. Then, a comparison with other feature selection methods is carried out in both accuracy and computational time. Experimental results show that the proposed methods consume less additional computational cost and result in a significant increase in the performance of MI-based BCI systems."
32802031,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a communication and control system linking the human brain and computers or other electronic devices. However, irrelevant channels and misleading features unrelated to tasks limit classification performance. To address these problems, we propose an efficient signal processing framework based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) for channel and feature selection, channel selection, and feature selection. Modified Stockwell transforms were used for a feature extraction, and multilevel hybrid PSO-Bayesian linear discriminant analysis was applied to optimization and classification. The BCI Competition III dataset I was used here to confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme. Compared to a method without optimization (89% accuracy), the best classification accuracy of the PSO-based scheme was 99% when less than 10.5% of the original features were used, the test time was reduced by more than 90%, and it achieved Kappa values and <i>F</i>-score of 0.98 and 98.99%, respectively, and better signal-to-noise ratio, thereby outperforming existing algorithms. The results show that the channel and feature selection scheme can accelerate the speed of convergence to the global optimum and reduce the training time. As the proposed framework can significantly improve classification performance, effectively reduce the number of features, and greatly shorten the test time, it can serve as a reference for related real-time BCI application system research."
32796607,"As an important paradigm of spontaneous brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), motor imagery (MI) has been widely used in the fields of neurological rehabilitation and robot control. Recently, researchers have proposed various methods for feature extraction and classification based on MI signals. The decoding model based on deep neural networks (DNNs) has attracted significant attention in the field of MI signal processing. Due to the strict requirements for subjects and experimental environments, it is difficult to collect large-scale and high-quality electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, the performance of a deep learning model depends directly on the size of the datasets. Therefore, the decoding of MI-EEG signals based on a DNN has proven highly challenging in practice. Based on this, we investigated the performance of different data augmentation (DA) methods for the classification of MI data using a DNN. First, we transformed the time series signals into spectrogram images using a short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Then, we evaluated and compared the performance of different DA methods for this spectrogram data. Next, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the MI signals and compared the classification performance of after DA. The Fréchet inception distance (FID) was used to evaluate the quality of the generated data (GD) and the classification accuracy, and mean kappa values were used to explore the best CNN-DA method. In addition, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and paired <i>t</i>-tests were used to assess the significance of the results. The results showed that the deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) provided better augmentation performance than traditional DA methods: geometric transformation (GT), autoencoder (AE), and variational autoencoder (VAE) (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Public datasets of the BCI competition IV (datasets 1 and 2b) were used to verify the classification performance. Improvements in the classification accuracies of 17% and 21% (<i>p</i> < 0.01) were observed after DA for the two datasets. In addition, the hybrid network CNN-DCGAN outperformed the other classification methods, with average kappa values of 0.564 and 0.677 for the two datasets."

As the microscopic details of individuals' brains are directly shaped by their rich experiences, musicians can develop certain neurological characteristics, such as improved brain plasticity, following extensive musical training. Specifically, the advanced bimanual motor coordination that pianists exhibit means that they may interact more effectively with BCI systems than their non-musically trained counterparts; this could lead to personalized BCI strategies according to the users' previously detected skills. This work assessed the performance of pianists as they interacted with an MI-based BCI system and compared it with that of a control group. The Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) machine learning algorithms were applied to the EEG signals for feature extraction and classification, respectively. The results revealed that the pianists achieved a higher level of BCI control by means of MI during the final trial (74.69%) compared to the control group (63.13%).

32780720,"Due to low spatial resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio of electroencephalogram (EEG), high accuracy classifications still suffer from lots of obstacles in the context of motor imagery (MI)-based brain-machine interface (BMI) systems. Particularly, it is extremely challenging to decode multiclass MI EEG from the same upper limb. This research proposes a novel feature learning approach to address the classification problem of 6-class MI tasks, including imaginary elbow flexion/extension, wrist supination/pronation, and hand close/open within the unilateral upper limb. Instead of the traditional common spatial pattern (CSP) or filter-bank CSP (FBCSP) manner, the Riemannian geometry (RG) framework involving Riemannian distance and Riemannian mean was directly adopted to extract tangent space (TS) features from spatial covariance matrices of the MI EEG trials. Subsequently, to reduce the dimensionality of the TS features, the algorithm of partial least squares regression was applied to obtain more separable and compact feature representations. The performance of the learned RG feature representations was validated by a linear discriminative analysis and support vector machine classifier, with an average accuracy of 80.50% and 79.70% on EEG dataset collected from 12 participants, respectively. These results demonstrate that compared with CSP and FBCSP features, the proposed approach can significantly increase the decoding accuracy for multiclass MI tasks from the same upper limb. This approach is promising and could potentially be applied in the context of MI-based BMI control of a robotic arm or a neural prosthesis for motor disabled patients with highly impaired upper limb."

32765639,"EEG pattern recognition is an important part of motor imagery- (MI-) based brain computer interface (BCI) system. Traditional EEG pattern recognition algorithm usually includes two steps, namely, feature extraction and feature classification. In feature extraction, common spatial pattern (CSP) is one of the most frequently used algorithms. However, in order to extract the optimal CSP features, prior knowledge and complex parameter adjustment are often required. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the most popular deep learning models at present. Within CNN, feature learning and pattern classification are carried out simultaneously during the procedure of iterative updating of network parameters; thus, it can remove the complicated manual feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning methodology which can be used for spatial-frequency feature learning and classification of motor imagery EEG. Specifically, a multilayer CNN model is designed according to the spatial-frequency characteristics of MI EEG signals. An experimental study is carried out on two MI EEG datasets (BCI competition III dataset IVa and a self-collected right index finger MI dataset) to validate the effectiveness of our algorithm in comparison with several closely related competing methods. Superior classification performance indicates that our proposed method is a promising pattern recognition algorithm for MI-based BCI system."
32748888,"Sensorimotor rhythm (SMR)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) has gained importance in recent years for the rehabilitation of motor deficits. However, there still remain many research questions to be addressed, such as unstructured Motor Imagery (MI) training procedures; a lack of methods to classify different MI tasks in a single hand, such as grasping and opening; and difficulty in decoding voluntary MI-evoked SMRs compared to FES-driven passive-movement-evoked SMRs. To address these issues, a study that is composed of two phases was conducted to develop and validate an SMR-based BCI-FES system with 2-class MI tasks in a single hand (Phase 1), and investigate the feasibility of the system with stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients (Phase 2). The results of Phase 1 showed that the accuracy of classifying 2-class MIs (approximately 71.25%) was significantly higher than the true chance level, while that of distinguishing voluntary and passive SMRs was not. In Phase 2, where the patients performed goal-oriented tasks in a semi-asynchronous mode, the effects of the FES existence type and adaptive learning on task performance were evaluated. The results showed that adaptive learning significantly increased the accuracy, and the accuracy after applying adaptive learning under the No-FES condition (61.9%) was significantly higher than the true chance level. The outcomes of the present research would provide insight into SMR-based BCI-controlled FES systems that can connect those with motor disabilities (e.g., stroke and TBI patients) to other people by greatly improving their quality of life. Recommendations for future work with a larger sample size and kinesthetic MI were also presented."
32746304,"The viability of electroencephalogram (EEG) based vocal imagery (VIm) and vocal intention (VInt) Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems has been investigated in this study. Four different types of experimental tasks related to humming has been designed and exploited here. They are: (i) non-task specific (NTS), (ii) motor task (MT), (iii) VIm task, and (iv) VInt task. EEG signals from seventeen participants for each of these tasks were recorded from 16 electrode locations on the scalp and its features were extracted and analysed using common spatial pattern (CSP) filter. These features were subsequently fed into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for classification. This analysis aimed to perform a binary classification, predicting whether the subject was performing one task or the other. Results from an extensive analysis showed a mean classification accuracy of 88.9% for VIm task and 91.1% for VInt task. This study clearly shows that VIm can be classified with ease and is a viable paradigm to integrate in BCIs. Such systems are not only useful for people with speech problems, but in general for people who use BCI systems to help them out in their everyday life, giving them another dimension of system control."
32746291,"Motor imagery based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) has been studied for improvement of patients' motor function in neurorehabilitation and motor assistance. However, the difficulties in performing imagery tasks limit its application. To overcome the limitation, an enhanced MI-BCI based on functional electrical stimulation (FES) and virtual reality (VR) is proposed in this study. On one hand, the FES is used to stimulate the subjects' lower limbs before their imagination to make them experience the muscles' contraction and improve their attention on the lower limbs, by which it is supposed that the subjects' motor imagery (MI) abilities can be enhanced. On the other hand, a ball-kicking movement scenario from the first-person perspective is designed to provide visual guidance for performing MI tasks. The combination of FES and VR can be used to reduce the difficulties in performing MI tasks and improve classification accuracy. Finally, the comparison experiments were conducted on twelve healthy subjects to validate the performance of the enhanced MI-BCI. The results show that the classification performance can be improved significantly by using the proposed MI-BCI in terms of the classification accuracy (ACC), the area under the curve (AUC) and the F1 score (paired t-test, )."
32746025,"One of the most popular methods in non-invasive brain machine interfaces (BMI) relies on the decoding of sensorimotor rhythms associated to sustained motor imagery. Although motor imagery has been intensively studied, its termination is mostly neglected. Here, we provide insights in the decoding of motor imagery termination and investigate the use of such decoder in closed-loop BMI. Participants (N = 9) were asked to perform kinesthetic motor imagery of both hands simultaneously cued with a clock indicating the initiation and termination of the action. Using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, we built a decoder to detect the transition between event-related desynchronization and event-related synchronization. Features for this decoder were correlates of motor termination in the upper μ and β bands. The decoder reached an accuracy of 76.2% (N = 9), revealing the high robustness of our approach. More importantly, this paper shows that the decoding of motor termination has an intrinsic latency mainly due to the delayed appearance of its correlates. Because the latency was consistent and thus predictable, users were able to compensate it after training. Using our decoding system, BMI users were able to adapt their behavior and modulate their sensorimotor rhythm to stop the device (clock) accurately on time. These results show the importance of closed-loop evaluations of BMI decoders and open new possibilities for BMI control using decoding of movement termination."
32745492,"Data augmentation (DA) has recently been demonstrated to achieve considerable performance gains for deep learning (DL)-increased accuracy and stability and reduced overfitting. Some electroencephalography (EEG) tasks suffer from low samples-to-features ratio, severely reducing DL effectiveness. DA with DL thus holds transformative promise for EEG processing, possibly like DL revolutionized computer vision, etc. NEW METHOD: We review trends and approaches to DA for DL in EEG to address: Which DA approaches exist and are common for which EEG tasks? What input features are used? And, what kind of accuracy gain can be expected? DA for DL on EEG begun 5 years ago and is steadily used more. We grouped DA techniques (noise addition, generative adversarial networks, sliding windows, sampling, Fourier transform, recombination of segmentation, and others) and EEG tasks (into seizure detection, sleep stages, motor imagery, mental workload, emotion recognition, motor tasks, and visual tasks). DA efficacy across techniques varied considerably. Noise addition and sliding windows provided the highest accuracy boost; mental workload most benefitted from DA. Sliding window, noise addition, and sampling methods most common for seizure detection, mental workload, and sleep stages, respectively. Percent of decoding accuracy explained by DA beyond unaugmented accuracy varied between 8 % for recombination of segmentation and 36 % for noise addition and from 14 % for motor imagery to 56 % for mental workload-29 % on average. DA increasingly used and considerably improved DL decoding accuracy on EEG. Additional publications-if adhering to our reporting guidelines-will facilitate more detailed analysis."
32745012,"In the context of motor imagery, electroencephalography (EEG) data vary from subject to subject such that the performance of a classifier trained on data of multiple subjects from a specific domain typically degrades when applied to a different subject. While collecting enough samples from each subject would address this issue, it is often too time-consuming and impractical. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel end-to-end deep domain adaptation method to improve the classification performance on a single subject (target domain) by taking the useful information from multiple subjects (source domain) into consideration. Especially, the proposed method jointly optimizes three modules, including a feature extractor, a classifier, and a domain discriminator. The feature extractor learns the discriminative latent features by mapping the raw EEG signals into a deep representation space. A center loss is further employed to constrain an invariant feature space and reduce the intrasubject nonstationarity. Furthermore, the domain discriminator matches the feature distribution shift between source and target domains by an adversarial learning strategy. Finally, based on the consistent deep features from both domains, the classifier is able to leverage the information from the source domain and accurately predict the label in the target domain at the test time. To evaluate our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on two real public EEG data sets, data set IIa, and data set IIb of brain-computer interface (BCI) Competition IV. The experimental results validate the efficacy of our method. Therefore, our method is promising to reduce the calibration time for the use of BCI and promote the development of BCI."
32733860,"Neurotechnology such as brain-machine interfaces (BMI) are currently being investigated as training devices for neurorehabilitation, when active movements are no longer possible. When the hand is paralyzed following a stroke for example, a robotic orthosis, functional electrical stimulation (FES) or their combination may provide movement assistance; i.e., the corresponding sensory and proprioceptive neurofeedback is given contingent to the movement intention or imagination, thereby closing the sensorimotor loop. Controlling these devices may be challenging or even frustrating. Direct comparisons between these two feedback modalities (robotics vs. FES) with regard to the workload they pose for the user are, however, missing. Twenty healthy subjects controlled a BMI by kinesthetic motor imagery of finger extension. Motor imagery-related sensorimotor desynchronization in the EEG beta frequency-band (17-21 Hz) was turned into passive opening of the contralateral hand by a robotic orthosis or FES in a randomized, cross-over block design. Mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration level were captured with the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) questionnaire by comparing these workload components to each other (weights), evaluating them individually (ratings), and estimating the respective combinations (adjusted workload ratings). The findings were compared to the task-related aspects of active hand movement with EMG feedback. Furthermore, both feedback modalities were compared with regard to their BMI performance. Robotic and FES feedback had similar workloads when weighting and rating the different components. For both robotics and FES, mental demand was the most relevant component, and higher than during active movement with EMG feedback. The FES task led to significantly more physical (<i>p</i> = 0.0368) and less temporal demand (<i>p</i> = 0.0403) than the robotic task in the adjusted workload ratings. Notably, the FES task showed a physical demand 2.67 times closer to the EMG task, but a mental demand 6.79 times closer to the robotic task. On average, significantly more onsets were reached during the robotic as compared to the FES task (17.22 onsets, SD = 3.02 vs. 16.46, SD = 2.94 out of 20 opportunities; <i>p</i> = 0.016), even though there were no significant differences between the BMI classification accuracies of the conditions (<i>p</i> = 0.806; CI = -0.027 to -0.034). These findings may inform the design of neurorehabilitation interfaces toward human-centered hardware for a more natural bidirectional interaction and acceptance by the user."
32733182,"Recent studies explored promising new quantitative methods to analyze electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This paper analyzes the correlation of two EEG parameters, Brain Symmetry Index (BSI) and Laterality Coefficient (LC), with established functional scales for the stroke assessment. Thirty-two healthy subjects and thirty-six stroke patients with upper extremity hemiparesis were recruited for this study. The stroke patients where subdivided in three groups according to the stroke location: Cortical, Subcortical, and Cortical + Subcortical. The participants performed assessment visits to record the EEG in the resting state and perform functional tests using rehabilitation scales. Then, stroke patients performed 25 sessions using a motor-imagery based Brain Computer Interface system (BCI). BSI was calculated with the EEG data in resting state and LC was calculated with the Event-Related Synchronization maps. The results of this study demonstrated significant differences in the BSI between the healthy group and Subcortical group (<i>P</i> = 0.001), and also between the healthy and Cortical+Subcortical group (<i>P</i> = 0.019). No significant differences were found between the healthy group and the Cortical group (<i>P</i> = 0.505). Furthermore, the BSI analysis in the healthy group based on gender showed statistical differences (<i>P</i> = 0.027). In the stroke group, the correlation between the BSI and the functional state of the upper extremity assessed by Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) was also significant, ρ = -0.430 and <i>P</i> = 0.046. The correlation between the BSI and the FMA-Lower extremity was not significant (ρ = -0.063, <i>P</i> = 0.852). Similarly, the LC calculated in the alpha band has significative correlation with FMA of upper extremity (ρ = -0.623 and <i>P</i> < 0.001) and FMA of lower extremity (ρ = -0.509 and <i>P</i> = 0.026). Other important significant correlations between LC and functional scales were observed. In addition, the patients showed an improvement in the FMA-upper extremity after the BCI therapy (ΔFMA = 1 median [IQR: 0-8], <i>P</i> = 0.002). The quantitative EEG tools used here may help support our understanding of stroke and how the brain changes during rehabilitation therapy. These tools can help identify changes in EEG biomarkers and parameters during therapy that might lead to improved therapy methods and functional prognoses."
32730917,"The processing of brain signals for Motor imagery (MI) classification to have better accuracy is a key issue in the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). While conventional methods like Artificial neural network (ANN), Linear discernment analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support vector machine (SVM), etc. have made significant progress in terms of classification accuracy, deep transfer learning-based systems have shown the potential to outperform them. BCI can play a vital role in enabling communication with the external world for persons with motor disabilities. Deep learning has been a success in many fields. However, for Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, relatively minimal work has been carried out using deep learning. This paper proposes a combination of Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) along with deep learning-based transfer learning to solve the problem. CWT transforms one dimensional EEG signals into two-dimensional time-frequency-amplitude representation enabling us to exploit available deep networks through transfer learning. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated in this study using an openly available BCI competition data-set. The results of the approach have been compared to earlier works on the same dataset, and a promising validation accuracy of 95.71% is achieved in our investigation. Our approach has shown significant improvement over other studies, which is 5.71% improvement over earlier reported algorithm (Tabar and Halici, 2017) using the same dataset. Results show the validity of the proposed Deep Transfer-Learning based technique as a state of the art technique for MI classification in BCI."
32726757,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems read and interpret brain activity directly from the brain. They can provide a means of communication or locomotion for patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases or stroke. However, non-stationarity of brain activity limits the reliable transfer of the algorithms that were trained during a calibration session to real-time BCI control. One source of non-stationarity is the user's brain response to the BCI output (feedback), for instance, whether the BCI feedback is perceived as an error by the user or not. By taking such sources of non-stationarity into account, the reliability of the BCI can be improved. In this work, we demonstrate a real-time implementation of a hybrid motor imagery BCI combining the information from the motor imagery signal and the error-related brain activity simultaneously so as to gain benefit from both sources. We show significantly improved performance in real-time BCI control across 12 participants, compared to a conventional motor imagery BCI. The significant improvement is in terms of classification accuracy, target hit rate, subjective perception of control and information-transfer rate. Moreover, our offline analyses of the recorded EEG data show that the error-related brain activity provides a more reliable source of information than the motor imagery signal. This work shows, for the first time, that the error-related brain activity classifier compared to the motor imagery classifier is more consistent when trained on calibration data and tested during online control. This likely explains why the proposed hybrid BCI allows for a more reliable means of communication or rehabilitation for patients in need."
32714232,"New trends on brain-computer interface (BCI) design are aiming to combine this technology with immersive virtual reality in order to provide a sense of realism to its users. In this study, we propose an experimental BCI to control an immersive telepresence system using motor imagery (MI). The system is immersive in the sense that the users can control the movement of a NAO humanoid robot in a first person perspective (1PP), i.e., as if the movement of the robot was his/her own. We analyze functional brain connectivity between 1PP and 3PP during the control of our BCI using graph theory properties such as degree, betweenness centrality, and efficiency. Changes in these metrics are obtained for the case of the 1PP, as well as for the traditional third person perspective (3PP) in which the user can see the movement of the robot as feedback. As proof-of-concept, electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded from two subjects while they performed MI to control the movement of the robot. The graph theoretical analysis was applied to the binary directed networks obtained through the partial directed coherence (PDC). In our preliminary assessment we found that the efficiency in the α brain rhythm is greater in 1PP condition in comparison to the 3PP at the prefrontal cortex. Also, a stronger influence of signals measured at EEG channel C3 (primary motor cortex) to other regions was found in 1PP condition. Furthermore, our preliminary results seem to indicate that α and β brain rhythms have a high indegree at prefrontal cortex in 1PP condition, and this could be possibly related to the experience of sense of agency. Therefore, using the PDC combined with graph theory while controlling a telepresence robot in an immersive system may contribute to understand the organization and behavior of brain networks in these environments."
32714167,"Common spatial pattern (CSP) method is widely used for spatial filtering and brain pattern extraction from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The participant-specific time window relative to the visual cue has a significant impact on the effectiveness of the CSP. However, the time window is usually selected experientially or manually. To solve this problem, we propose a novel feature selection approach for MI-based BCIs. Specifically, multiple time segments were obtained by decomposing each EEG sample of the MI task. Furthermore, the features were extracted by CSP from each time segment and were combined to form a new feature vector. Finally, the optimal temporal combination patterns for the new feature vector were selected based on four feature selection algorithms, i.e., mutual information, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, principal component analysis and stepwise linear discriminant analysis (denoted as MUIN, LASSO, PCA, and SWLDA, respectively), and the classification algorithm was employed to evaluate the average classification accuracy. With three BCI competition datasets, the results of the four proposed algorithms were compared with traditional CSP algorithm in classification accuracy. Experimental results show that compared with traditional algorithm, the proposed methods significantly improve performance. Specifically, the LASSO achieved the highest accuracy (88.58%) among the proposed methods. Importantly, the average classification accuracies using the proposed approaches significantly improved 10.14% (MUIN), 11.40% (LASSO), 6.08% (PCA), and 10.25% (SWLDA) compared to that using CSP. These results indicate that the proposed approach is expected to be practical in MI-based BCIs."
32706190,"One of the challenges in brain-computer interface systems is obtaining motor imagery recognition from brain activities. Brain-signal decoding robustness and system performance improvement during the motor imagery process are two of the essential issues in brain-computer interface research. In conventional approaches, ineffective decoding of features and high complexity of algorithms often lead to unsatisfactory performance. A novel method for the recognition of motor imagery tasks is developed based on employing a modified S-transforms for spectro-temporal representation to characterize the behavior of electrocorticogram activities. A classifier is trained by using a support vector machine, and an optimized wrapper approach is applied to guide selection to implement the representation selection obtained. A channel selection algorithm optimizes the wrapper approach by adding a cross-validation step, which effectively improves the classification performance. The modified S-transform can accurately capture event-related desynchronization/event-related synchronization phenomena and can effectively locate sensorimotor rhythm information. The optimized wrapper approach used in this scheme can effectively reduce the feature dimension and improve algorithm efficiency. The method is evaluated on a public electrocorticogram dataset with a recognition accuracy of 98% and an information transfer rate of 0.8586 bit/trial. To verify the effect of the channel selection, both electrocorticogram and electroencephalogram data are experimentally analyzed. Furthermore, the computational efficiency of this scheme demonstrates its potential for online brain-computer interface systems in future cognitive tasks."
32676841,"Both labeled and unlabeled data have been widely used in electroencephalographic (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI). However, labeled EEG samples are generally scarce and expensive to collect, while unlabeled samples are considered to be abundant in real applications. Although the semi-supervised learning (SSL) allows us to utilize both labeled and unlabeled data to improve the classification performance as against supervised algorithms, it has been reported that unlabeled data occasionally undermine the performance of SSL in some cases. To overcome this challenge, we propose a collaborative representation-based semi-supervised extreme learning machine (CR-SSELM) algorithm to evaluate the risk of unlabeled samples by a new safety-control mechanism. Specifically, the ELM model is firstly used to predict unlabeled samples and then the collaborative representation (CR) approach is employed to reconstruct the unlabeled samples according to the obtained prediction results, from which the risk degree of unlabeled sample is defined. A risk-based regularization term is then constructed accordingly and embedded into the objective function of the SS-ELM. Experiments conducted on benchmark and EEG datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the ELM and SS-ELM algorithm. Moreover, the proposed CR-SSELM even offers the best performance while SS-ELM yields worse performance compared with its supervised counterpart (ELM). Graphical abstract This paper proposes a collaborative representation-based semi-supervised extreme learning machine (CR-SSELM) algorithm to evaluate the risk of unlabeled samples by a new safety-control mechanism. It is aim to solve the safety problem of SS-ELM method that SS-ELM yields worse performance than ELM. With the help of safety mechanism, the performance of our method is still better than supervised ELM method."

To this end, we have used densely connected neural and convolutional networks, together with a genetic algorithm to find the best parameters for these networks. The results we obtained are a 60% success rate in the classification of four imagined objects (a tree, a dog, an airplane and a house) plus a state of relaxation, thus outperforming the state of the art in visual imagery classification."
32655347,"Neurofeedback (NF) and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications rely on the registration and real-time feedback of individual patterns of brain activity with the aim of achieving self-regulation of specific neural substrates or control of external devices. These approaches have historically employed visual stimuli. However, in some cases vision is unsuitable or inadequately engaging. Other sensory modalities, such as auditory or haptic feedback have been explored, and multisensory stimulation is expected to improve the quality of the interaction loop. Moreover, for motor imagery tasks, closing the sensorimotor loop through haptic feedback may be relevant for motor rehabilitation applications, as it can promote plasticity mechanisms. This survey reviews the various haptic technologies and describes their application to BCIs and NF. We identify major trends in the use of haptic interfaces for BCI and NF systems and discuss crucial aspects that could motivate further studies."
32619588,"The classification of psychological tasks such as motor imagery based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is an essential issue in the brain computer interface (BCI) system. The feature extraction is an important issue for improving classification accuracy of BCI system. For extracting discriminative features, common spatial pattern (CSP) is an effective feature extraction method. However, features extracted by CSP are dense, and even feature patterns are repeatedly selected in the feature space. A sparse CSP algorithm is proposed, which embeds the sparse techniques and iterative search into the CSP. To improve the classification performance, two regularization parameters are added to the traditional linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The sparse CSP algorithm can select several channels of EEG signals with the most obvious features. The improved regularized discriminant analysis is used to solve the singularity problem and improve the feature classification accuracy. Comparison with Existing Method(s): The proposed algorithm was evaluated by the data set I of the IVth BCI competition and our dataset. The experimental results of the BCI competition dataset show that accuracy of the improved algorithm is 10.75 % higher than that of the traditional algorithm. Comparing with the currently existing methods for the same data, it also shows excellent classification performance. The effectiveness of the improved algorithm is also shown in experiments on our dataset. It sufficiently proves that the improved algorithm proposed in this paper improves the classification performance of motor intent recognition."
32593293,"Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability. Cost-effective post-stroke rehabilitation programs for upper limb are critically needed. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) which enable the modulation of Electroencephalography (EEG) sensorimotor rhythms are promising tools to promote post-stroke recovery of upper limb motor function. The ""Promotoer"" study intends to boost the application of the EEG-based BCIs in clinical practice providing evidence for a short/long-term efficacy in enhancing post-stroke hand functional motor recovery and quantifiable indices of the participants response to a BCI-based intervention. To these aims, a longitudinal study will be performed in which subacute stroke participants will undergo a hand motor imagery (MI) training assisted by the Promotoer system, an EEG-based BCI system fully compliant with rehabilitation requirements. This longitudinal 2-arm randomized controlled superiority trial will include 48 first ever, unilateral, subacute stroke participants, randomly assigned to 2 intervention groups: the BCI-assisted hand MI training and a hand MI training not supported by BCI. Both interventions are delivered (3 weekly session; 6 weeks) as add-on regimen to standard intensive rehabilitation. A multidimensional assessment will be performed at: randomization/pre-intervention, 48 h post-intervention, and at 1, 3 and 6 month/s after end of intervention. Primary outcome measure is the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA, upper extremity) at 48 h post-intervention. Secondary outcome measures include: the upper extremity FMA at follow-up, the Modified Ashworth Scale, the Numeric Rating Scale for pain, the Action Research Arm Test, the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, the Manual Muscle Test, all collected at the different timepoints as well as neurophysiological and neuroimaging measures. We expect the BCI-based rewarding of hand MI practice to promote long-lasting retention of the early induced improvement in hand motor outcome and also, this clinical improvement to be sustained by a long-lasting neuroplasticity changes harnessed by the BCI-based intervention. Furthermore, the longitudinal multidimensional assessment will address the selection of those stroke participants who best benefit of a BCI-assisted therapy, consistently advancing the transfer of BCIs to a best clinical practice.

32590360,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are aimed at providing a new way of communication between the human brain and external devices. One of the major tasks associated with the BCI system is to improve classification performance of the motor imagery (MI) signal. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are widely used for the MI BCI system. The raw EEG signals are usually non-stationary time series with weak class properties, degrading the classification performance. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been successfully applied to pattern extraction which provides meaningful data presentation. However, NMF is unsupervised and cannot make use of the label information. Based on the label information of MI EEG data, we propose a novel method, called double-constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (DCNMF), to improve the classification performance of NMF on MI BCI. The proposed method constructs a couple of label matrices as the constraints on the NMF procedure to make the EEGs with the same class labels have the similar representation in the low-dimensional space, while the EEGs with different class labels have dissimilar representations as much as possible. Accordingly, the extracted features obtain obvious class properties, which are optimal to the classification of MI EEG. This study is conducted on the BCI competition III datasets (I and IVa). The proposed method helps to achieve a higher average accuracy across two datasets (79.00% for dataset I, 77.78% for dataset IVa); its performance is about 10% better than the existing studies in the literature. Our study provides a novel solution for MI BCI analysis from the perspective of label constraint; it provides convenience for semi-supervised learning of features and significantly improves the classification performance."
32588685,"The use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been related to the improvement of motor and learning tasks. The current research studies the effects of an asymmetric tDCS setup over brain connectivity, when the subject is performing a motor imagery (MI) task during five consecutive days. A brain-computer interface (BCI) based on electroencephalography is simulated in offline analysis to study the effect that tDCS has over different electrode configurations for the BCI. This way, the BCI performance is used as a validation index of the effect of the tDCS setup by the analysis of the classifier accuracy of the experimental sessions. In addition, the relationship between the brain connectivity and the BCI accuracy performance is analyzed. Results indicate that tDCS group, in comparison to the placebo sham group, shows a higher significant number of connectivity interactions in the motor electrodes during MI tasks and an increasing BCI accuracy over the days. However, the asymmetric tDCS setup does not improve the BCI performance of the electrodes in the intended hemisphere."
32581739,"Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can potentially enable people to non-invasively and directly communicate with others using brain activities. Artifacts generated from body activities (e.g., eyeblinks and teeth clenches) often contaminate EEGs and make EEG-based classification/identification hard. Although independent component analysis (ICA) is the gold-standard technique for attenuating the effects of such contamination, the estimated independent components are still mixed with artifactual and neuronal information because ICA relies only on the independence assumption. The same problem occurs when using independent vector analysis (IVA), an extended ICA method. To solve this problem, we designed an independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA)-based automatic artifact reduction technique that clearly models sources from observations under the independence assumption and a low-rank nature in the frequency domain. For automatic artifact reduction, we combined the signal separation technique with an independent component classifier for EEGs named ICLabel. To assess the comparative efficiency of the proposed method, the discriminabilities of artifact-reduced EEGs using ICA, IVA, and ILRMA were determined using an open-access EEG dataset named OpenBMI, which contains EEG data obtained through three BCI paradigms [motor-imagery (MI), event-related potential (ERP), and steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)]. BCI performances were obtained using these three paradigms after applying artifact reduction techniques, and the results suggested that our proposed method has the potential to achieve higher discriminability than ICA and IVA for BCIs. In addition, artifact reduction using the ILRMA approach clearly improved (by over 70%) the averaged BCI performances using artifact-reduced data sufficiently for most needs of the BCI community. The extension of ICA families to supervised separation that leaves the discriminative ability would further improve the usability of BCIs for real-life environments in which artifacts frequently contaminate EEGs."
32575798,"Recognition of motor imagery intention is one of the hot current research focuses of brain-computer interface (BCI) studies. It can help patients with physical dyskinesia to convey their movement intentions. In recent years, breakthroughs have been made in the research on recognition of motor imagery task using deep learning, but if the important features related to motor imagery are ignored, it may lead to a decline in the recognition performance of the algorithm. This paper proposes a new deep multi-view feature learning method for the classification task of motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In order to obtain more representative motor imagery features in EEG signals, we introduced a multi-view feature representation based on the characteristics of EEG signals and the differences between different features. Different feature extraction methods were used to respectively extract the time domain, frequency domain, time-frequency domain and spatial features of EEG signals, so as to made them cooperate and complement. Then, the deep restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) network improved by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding(t-SNE) was adopted to learn the multi-view features of EEG signals, so that the algorithm removed the feature redundancy while took into account the global characteristics in the multi-view feature sequence, reduced the dimension of the multi-visual features and enhanced the recognizability of the features. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) was chosen to classify deep multi-view features. Applying our proposed method to the BCI competition IV 2a dataset we obtained excellent classification results. The results show that the deep multi-view feature learning method further improved the classification accuracy of motor imagery tasks."

This experiment collected data from twenty-five healthy subjects on three tasks: 1) imagining the movement of right hand, 2) imagining the movement of right elbow, and 3) keeping resting with eyes open, which results in a total of 22,500 trials. The dataset provided includes data of three stages: 1) raw recorded data, 2) pre-processed data after operations such as artifact removal, and 3) trial data that can be directly used for feature extraction and classification. Different researchers can reuse the dataset according to their needs. We expect that this dataset will facilitate the analysis of brain activation patterns of the same limb and the study of decoding techniques for MI."
32561504,"The traditional rehabilitation for neurological diseases lacks the active participation of patients, its process is monotonous and tedious, and the effects need to be improved. Therefore, a new type of rehabilitation technology with more active participation combining brain-computer interface (BCI) with virtual reality (VR) has developed rapidly in recent years and has been used in rehabilitation in neurological diseases. This narrative review analyzed and characterized the development and application of the new training system (BCI-VR) in rehabilitation of neurological diseases from the perspective of the BCI paradigm, to provide a pathway for future research in this field. The review involved a search of the Web of Science-Science Citation Index/Social Sciences Citation Index and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases; 39 papers were selected. Advantages and challenges of BCI-VR - based neurological rehabilitation were analyzed in detail. Most BCI-VR studies included could be classified by 3 major BCI paradigms: motor imagery, P300, and steady-state visual-evoked potential. Integrating VR scenes into BCI systems could effectively promote the recovery process from nervous system injuries as compared with traditional methods. As compared with rehabilitation based on traditional BCI, rehabilitation based on BCI-VR can provide better feedback information for patients and promote the recovery of brain function. By solving the challenges and continual development, the BCI-VR system can be broadly applied to the clinical treatment of various neurological diseases."
32548772,"This paper proposes a novel feature selection method utilizing Rényi min-entropy-based algorithm for achieving a highly efficient brain-computer interface (BCI). Usually, wavelet packet transformation (WPT) is extensively used for feature extraction from electro-encephalogram (EEG) signals. For the case of multiple-class problem, classification accuracy solely depends on the effective feature selection from the WPT features. In conventional approaches, Shannon entropy and mutual information methods are often used to select the features. In this work, we have shown that our proposed Rényi min-entropy-based approach outperforms the conventional methods for multiple EEG signal classification. The dataset of BCI competition-IV (contains 4-class motor imagery EEG signal) is used for this experiment. The data are preprocessed and separated as the classes and used for the feature extraction using WPT. Then, for feature selection Shannon entropy, mutual information, and Rényi min-entropy methods are applied. With the selected features, four-class motor imagery EEG signals are classified using several machine learning algorithms. The results suggest that the proposed method is better than the conventional approaches for multiple-class BCI."
32534382,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable people to control an external device by analyzing the brain's neural activity. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which is an emerging optical imaging technique, is frequently used in non-invasive BCIs. Determining the subject-specific features is an important concern in enhancing the classification accuracy as well as reducing the complexity of fNIRS based BCI systems. In this study, the effectiveness of subject-specific feature selection on classification accuracy of fNIRS signals is examined. In order to determine the subject-specific optimal feature subsets, stepwise regression analysis based on sequential feature selection (SWR-SFS) and ReliefF methods were employed. Feature selection is applied on time-domain features of fNIRS signals such as mean, slope, peak, skewness and kurtosis values of signals. Linear discriminant analysis, k nearest neighborhood and support vector machines are employed to evaluate the performance of the selected feature subsets. The proposed techniques are validated on benchmark motor imagery (MI) and mental arithmetic (MA) based fNIRS datasets collected from 29 healthy subjects. Both SWR-SFS and reliefF feature selection methods have significantly improved the classification accuracy. However, the best results (88.67% (HbR) and 86.43% (HbO) for MA dataset and 77.01% (HbR) and 71.32% (HbO) for MI dataset) were achieved using SWR-SFS while feature selection provided extremely high feature reduction rates (89.50% (HbR) and 93.99% (HbO) for MA dataset and 94.04% (HbR) and 97.73% (HbO) for MI dataset). The results of the study indicate that employing feature selection improves both MA and MI-based fNIRS signals classification performance significantly."
32525885,"Electroencephalography (EEG) datasets are often small and high dimensional, owing to cumbersome recording processes. In these conditions, powerful machine learning techniques are essential to deal with the large amount of information and overcome the curse of dimensionality. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have achieved promising performance in EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications, but they involve computationally intensive training algorithms and hyperparameter optimization methods. Thus, an awareness of the quality-cost trade-off, although usually overlooked, is highly beneficial. In this paper, we apply a hyperparameter optimization procedure based on Genetic Algorithms to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), all of them purposely shallow. We compare their relative quality and energy-time cost, but we also analyze the variability in the structural complexity of networks of the same type with similar accuracies. The experimental results show that the optimization procedure improves accuracy in all models, and that CNN models with only one hidden convolutional layer can equal or slightly outperform a 6-layer Deep Belief Network. FFNN and RNN were not able to reach the same quality, although the cost was significantly lower. The results also highlight the fact that size within the same type of network is not necessarily correlated with accuracy, as smaller models can and do match, or even surpass, bigger ones in performance. In this regard, overfitting is likely a contributing factor since deep learning approaches struggle with limited training examples."
32502798,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are emerging as powerful tools for EEG decoding: these techniques, by automatically learning relevant features for class discrimination, improve EEG decoding performances without relying on handcrafted features. Nevertheless, the learned features are difficult to interpret and most of the existing CNNs introduce many trainable parameters. Here, we propose a lightweight and interpretable shallow CNN (Sinc-ShallowNet), by stacking a temporal sinc-convolutional layer (designed to learn band-pass filters, each having only the two cut-off frequencies as trainable parameters), a spatial depthwise convolutional layer (reducing channel connectivity and learning spatial filters tied to each band-pass filter), and a fully-connected layer finalizing the classification. This convolutional module limits the number of trainable parameters and allows direct interpretation of the learned spectral-spatial​ features via simple kernel visualizations. Furthermore, we designed a post-hoc gradient-based technique to enhance interpretation by identifying the more relevant and more class-specific features. Sinc-ShallowNet was evaluated on benchmark motor-execution and motor-imagery datasets and against different design choices and training strategies. Results show that (i) Sinc-ShallowNet outperformed a traditional machine learning algorithm and other CNNs for EEG decoding; (ii) The learned spectral-spatial features matched well-known EEG motor-related activity; (iii) The proposed architecture performed better with a larger number of temporal kernels still maintaining a good compromise between accuracy and parsimony, and with a trialwise rather than a cropped training strategy. In perspective, the proposed approach, with its interpretative capacity, can be exploited to investigate cognitive/motor aspects whose EEG correlates are yet scarcely known, potentially characterizing their relevant features."
32498642,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide a means of communication to individuals with severe motor disorders, such as those presenting as locked-in. Many BCI paradigms rely on motor neural pathways, which are often impaired in these individuals. However, recent findings suggest that visuospatial function may remain intact. This study aimed to determine whether visuospatial imagery, a previously unexplored task, could be used to signify intent in an online electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI. Eighteen typically developed participants imagined checkerboard arrow stimuli in four quadrants of the visual field in 5-s trials, while signals were collected using 16 dry electrodes over the visual cortex. In online blocks, participants received graded visual feedback based on their performance. An initial BCI pipeline (visuospatial imagery classifier I) attained a mean accuracy of [Formula: see text]% classifying rest against visuospatial imagery in online trials. This BCI pipeline was further improved using restriction to alpha band features (visuospatial imagery classifier II), resulting in a mean pseudo-online accuracy of [Formula: see text]%. Accuracies exceeded the threshold for practical BCIs in 12 participants. This study supports the use of visuospatial imagery as a real-time, binary EEG-BCI control paradigm."
32479507,"Input devices such as motor-imagery brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are often unreliable. In theory, channel coding can be used in the human-machine loop to robustly encapsulate intention through noisy input devices but standard feedforward error correction codes cannot be practically applied. We present a practical and general probabilistic user interface for binary input devices with very high noise levels. Our approach allows any level of robustness to be achieved, regardless of noise level, where reliable feedback such as a visual display is available. In particular, we show efficient zooming interfaces based on feedback channel codes for two-class binary problems with noise levels characteristic of modalities such as motor-imagery based BCI, with accuracy <75%. We outline general principles based on separating channel, line and source coding in human-machine loop design. We develop a novel selection mechanism which can achieve arbitrarily reliable selection with a noisy two-state button. We show automatic online adaptation to changing channel statistics, and operation without precise calibration of error rates. A range of visualisations are used to construct user interfaces which implicitly code for these channels in a way that it is transparent to users. We validate our approach with a set of Monte Carlo simulations, and empirical results from a human-in-the-loop experiment showing the approach operates effectively at 50-70% of the theoretical optimum across a range of channel conditions."
32474459,"A neurological disorder is one of the significant problems of the nervous system that affects the essential functions of the human brain and spinal cord. Monitoring brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG) has become an important tool in the diagnosis of brain disorders. The robust automatic classification of EEG signals is an important step towards detecting a brain disorder in its earlier stages before status deterioration. Motivated by the computation capabilities of natural evolution strategies (NES), this paper introduces an effective automatic classification approach denoted as natural evolution optimization-based deep learning (NEODL). The proposed classifier is an ingredient in a signal processing chain that comprises other state-of-the-art techniques in a consistent framework for the purpose of automatic EEG classification. The proposed framework consists of four steps. First, the L1-principal component analysis technique is used to enhance the raw EEG signal against any expected artifacts or noise. Second, the purified EEG signal is decomposed into a number of sub-bands by applying the wavelet transform technique where a number of spectral and statistical features are extracted. Third, the extracted features are examined using the artificial bee colony approach in order to optimally select the best features. Lastly, the selected features are treated using the proposed NEODL classifier, where the input signal is classified according to the problem at hand. The proposed approach is evaluated using two benchmark datasets and addresses two neurological disorder applications: epilepsy disease and motor imagery. Several experiments are conducted where the proposed classifier outperforms other deep learning techniques as well as other existing approaches. The proposed framework, including the proposed classifier (NEODL), has a promising performance in the classification of EEG signals, including epilepsy disease and motor imagery. Based on the given results, it is expected that this approach will also be useful for the identification of the epileptogenic areas in the human brain. Accordingly, it may find application in the neuro-intensive care units, epilepsy monitoring units, and practical brain-computer interface systems in clinics."
32410938,"Augmented reality (AR) enhances the user's environment by projecting virtual objects into the real world in real-time. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are systems that enable users to control external devices with their brain signals. BCIs can exploit AR technology to interact with the physical and virtual world and to explore new ways of displaying feedback. This is important for users to perceive and regulate their brain activity or shape their communication intentions while operating in the physical world. In this study, twelve healthy participants were introduced to and asked to choose between two motor-imagery tasks: mental drawing and interacting with a virtual cube. Participants first performed a functional localizer run, which was used to select a single fNIRS channel for decoding their intentions in eight subsequent choice-encoding runs. In each run participants were asked to select one choice of a six-item list. A rotating AR cube was displayed on a computer screen as the main stimulus, where each face of the cube was presented for 6 s and represented one choice of the six-item list. For five consecutive trials, participants were instructed to perform the motor-imagery task when the face of the cube that represented their choice was facing them (therewith temporally encoding the selected choice). In the end of each run, participants were provided with the decoded choice based on a joint analysis of all five trials. If the decoded choice was incorrect, an active error-correction procedure was applied by the participant. The choice list provided in each run was based on the decoded choice of the previous run. The experimental design allowed participants to navigate twice through a virtual menu that consisted of four levels if all choices were correctly decoded. Here we demonstrate for the first time that by using AR feedback and flexible choice encoding in form of search trees, we can increase the degrees of freedom of a BCI system. We also show that participants can successfully navigate through a nested menu and achieve a mean accuracy of 74% using a single motor-imagery task and a single fNIRS channel."
32394192,"Transfer learning enables the adaption of models to handle mismatches of distributions across sessions or across subjects. In this paper, we proposed a new transfer learning algorithm to classify motor imagery EEG data. By analyzing the power spectrum of EEG data related to motor imagery, the shared features across sessions or across subjects, namely, the mean and variance of model parameters, are extracted. Then, select the data sets that were most relevant to the new data set according to Euclidean distance to update the shared features. Finally, utilize the shared features and subject/session-specific features jointly to generate a new model. We evaluated our algorithm by analyzing the motor imagery EEG data from 10 healthy participants and a public data set from BCI competition IV. The classification accuracy of the proposed transfer learning is higher than that of traditional machine learning algorithms. The results of the paired t test showed that the classification results of PSD and the transfer learning algorithm were significantly different (p = 2.0946e-9), and the classification results of CSP and the transfer learning algorithm were significantly different (p = 1.9122e-6). The test accuracy of data set 2a of BCI competition IV was 85.7% ± 5.4%, which was higher than that of related traditional machine learning algorithms. Preliminary results suggested that the proposed algorithm can be effectively applied to the classification of motor imagery EEG signals across sessions and across subjects and the performance is better than that of the traditional machine learning algorithms. It can be promising to be applied to the field of brain-computer interface (BCI). Graphical abstract."
32380494,"Brain Computer Interface (BCI) inefficiency indicates that there would be 10% to 50% of users are unable to operate Motor-Imagery-based BCI systems. Importantly, the almost all previous studieds on BCI inefficiency were based on tests of Sensory Motor Rhythm (SMR) feature. In this work, we assessed the occurrence of BCI inefficiency with SMR and Movement-Related Cortical Potential (MRCP) features. A pool of datasets of resting state and movements related EEG signals was recorded with 93 subjects during 2 sessions in separated days. Two methods, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and template matching, were used for SMR and MRCP feature extraction, and a winner-take-all strategy was applied to assess pattern recognition with posterior probabilities from Linear Discriminant Analysis to combine SMR and MRCP features. The results showed that the two types of features showed high complementarity, in line with their weak intercorrelation. In the subject group with poor accuracies (< 70%) by SMR feature in the two-class problem (right foot vs. right hand), the combination of SMR and MRCP features improved the averaged accuracy from 62% to 79%. Importantly, accuracies obtained by feature combination exceeded the inefficiency threshold. The feature combination of SMR and MRCP is not new in BCI decoding, but the large scale and repeatable study on BCI inefficiency assessment by using SMR and MRCP features is novel. MRCP feature provides the similar classification accuracies on the two subject groups with poor (< 70%) and good (> 90%) accuracies by SMR feature. These results suggest that the combination of SMR and MRCP features may be a practical approach to reduce BCI inefficiency. While, 'BCI inefficiency' might be more aptly called 'SMR inefficiency' after this study."
32369802,"Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) use an individual's ability to volitionally modulate localized brain activity, often as a therapy for motor dysfunction or to probe causal relations between brain activity and behavior. However, many individuals cannot learn to successfully modulate their brain activity, greatly limiting the efficacy of BCI for therapy and for basic scientific inquiry. Formal experiments designed to probe the nature of BCI learning have offered initial evidence that coherent activity across spatially distributed and functionally diverse cognitive systems is a hallmark of individuals who can successfully learn to control the BCI. However, little is known about how these distributed networks interact through time to support learning. Here, we address this gap in knowledge by constructing and applying a multimodal network approach to decipher brain-behavior relations in motor imagery-based brain-computer interface learning using magnetoencephalography. Specifically, we employ a minimally constrained matrix decomposition method - non-negative matrix factorization - to simultaneously identify regularized, covarying subgraphs of functional connectivity, to assess their similarity to task performance, and to detect their time-varying expression. We find that learning is marked by diffuse brain-behavior relations: good learners displayed many subgraphs whose temporal expression tracked performance. Individuals also displayed marked variation in the spatial properties of subgraphs such as the connectivity between the frontal lobe and the rest of the brain, and in the temporal properties of subgraphs such as the stage of learning at which they reached maximum expression. From these observations, we posit a conceptual model in which certain subgraphs support learning by modulating brain activity in sensors near regions important for sustaining attention. To test this model, we use tools that stipulate regional dynamics on a networked system (network control theory), and find that good learners display a single subgraph whose temporal expression tracked performance and whose architecture supports easy modulation of sensors located near brain regions important for attention. The nature of our contribution to the neuroscience of BCI learning is therefore both computational and theoretical; we first use a minimally-constrained, individual specific method of identifying mesoscale structure in dynamic brain activity to show how global connectivity and interactions between distributed networks supports BCI learning, and then we use a formal network model of control to lend theoretical support to the hypothesis that these identified subgraphs are well suited to modulate attention."
32351371,"""Locked-in"" patients lose their ability to communicate naturally due to motor system dysfunction. Brain-computer interfacing offers a solution for their inability to communicate by enabling motor-independent communication. Straightforward and convenient in-session communication is essential in clinical environments. The present study introduces a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based binary communication paradigm that requires limited preparation time and merely nine optodes. Eighteen healthy participants performed two mental imagery tasks, mental drawing and spatial navigation, to answer yes/no questions during one of two auditorily cued time windows. Each of the six questions was answered five times, resulting in five trials per answer. This communication paradigm thus combines both spatial (two different mental imagery tasks, here mental drawing for ""yes"" and spatial navigation for ""no"") and temporal (distinct time windows for encoding a ""yes"" and ""no"" answer) fNIRS signal features for information encoding. Participants' answers were decoded in simulated real-time using general linear model analysis. Joint analysis of all five encoding trials resulted in an average accuracy of 66.67 and 58.33% using the oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR) hemoglobin signal respectively. For half of the participants, an accuracy of 83.33% or higher was reached using either the HbO signal or the HbR signal. For four participants, effective communication with 100% accuracy was achieved using either the HbO or HbR signal. An explorative analysis investigated the differentiability of the two mental tasks based solely on spatial fNIRS signal features. Using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) group single-trial accuracies of 58.33% (using 20 training trials per task) and 60.56% (using 40 training trials per task) could be obtained. Combining the five trials per run using a majority voting approach heightened these MVPA accuracies to 62.04 and 75%. Additionally, an fNIRS suitability questionnaire capturing participants' physical features was administered to explore its predictive value for evaluating general data quality. Obtained questionnaire scores correlated significantly (<i>r</i> = -0.499) with the signal-to-noise of the raw light intensities. While more work is needed to further increase decoding accuracy, this study shows the potential of answer encoding using spatiotemporal fNIRS signal features or spatial fNIRS signal features only."
32334608,"A substantial number of clinical studies have demonstrated the functional recovery induced by the use of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology in patients after stroke. The objective of this review is to evaluate the effect sizes of clinical studies investigating the use of BCIs in restoring upper extremity function after stroke and the potentiating effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on BCI training for motor recovery. The databases (PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, and PEDro) were systematically searched for eligible single-group or clinical controlled studies regarding the effects of BCIs in hemiparetic upper extremity recovery after stroke. Single-group studies were qualitatively described, but only controlled-trial studies were included in the meta-analysis. The PEDro scale was used to assess the methodological quality of the controlled studies. A meta-analysis of upper extremity function was performed by pooling the standardized mean difference (SMD). Subgroup meta-analyses regarding the use of external devices in combination with the application of BCIs were also carried out. We summarized the neural mechanism of the use of BCIs on stroke. A total of 1015 records were screened. Eighteen single-group studies and 15 controlled studies were included. The studies showed that BCIs seem to be safe for patients with stroke. The single-group studies consistently showed a trend that suggested BCIs were effective in improving upper extremity function. The meta-analysis (of 12 studies) showed a medium effect size favoring BCIs for improving upper extremity function after intervention (SMD = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.18-0.66; I<sup>2</sup> = 48%; P < 0.001; fixed-effects model), while the long-term effect (five studies) was not significant (SMD = 0.12; 95% CI = - 0.28 - 0.52; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; P = 0.540; fixed-effects model). A subgroup meta-analysis indicated that using functional electrical stimulation as the external device in BCI training was more effective than using other devices (P = 0.010). Using movement attempts as the trigger task in BCI training appears to be more effective than using motor imagery (P = 0.070). The use of tDCS (two studies) could not further facilitate the effects of BCI training to restore upper extremity motor function (SMD = - 0.30; 95% CI = - 0.96 - 0.36; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; P = 0.370; fixed-effects model). The use of BCIs has significant immediate effects on the improvement of hemiparetic upper extremity function in patients after stroke, but the limited number of studies does not support its long-term effects. BCIs combined with functional electrical stimulation may be a better combination for functional recovery than other kinds of neural feedback. The mechanism for functional recovery may be attributed to the activation of the ipsilesional premotor and sensorimotor cortical network."
32329278,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a new-type human-computer interaction technique. To explore the separability of fNIRS signals in different motor imageries on the single limb, the study measured the fNIRS signals of 15 subjects (amateur football fans) during three different motor imageries of the right foot (passing, stopping and shooting). And the correlation coefficient of the HbO signal during different motor imageries was extracted as features for the input of a three-classification model based on support vector machines. The results found that the classification accuracy of the three motor imageries of the right foot was 78.89%±6.161%. The classification accuracy of the two-classification of motor imageries of the right foot, that is, passing and stopping, passing and shooting, and stopping and shooting was 85.17%±4.768%, 82.33%±6.011%, and 89.33%±6.713%, respectively. The results demonstrate that the fNIRS of different motor imageries of the single limb is separable, which is expected to add new control commands to fNIRS-BCI and also provide a new option for rehabilitation training and control peripherals for unilateral stroke patients. Besides, the study also confirms that the correlation coefficient can be used as an effective feature to classify different motor imageries."
32311375,"Motor imagery (MI) related features are typically extracted from a fixed frequency band and time window of EEG signal. Meanwhile, the time when the brain activity associated with the occurring task varies from person to person and trial to trial. Thus, some of the discarded EEG data with time may contain MI-related information. This study proposes a temporal frequency joint sparse optimization and fuzzy fusion (TFSOFF) method for joint frequency band optimization and classification fusion on multiple time windows to effectively utilize the signals of all time period within the MI task. Raw EEG data are first segmented into multiple subtime windows using a sliding window approach. Then, a set of overlapping bandpass filters is performed on each time window to generate a set of overlapping subbands, and common spatial pattern is used for feature extraction at each subband. Joint frequency band optimization is conducted on multiple time windows using a joint sparse optimization model. Fuzzy integral is used to fuse each time window after joint optimization. The proposed TFSOFF is validated on two public EEG datasets and compared with several other competing methods. Experimental results show that the proposed TFSOFF can effectively extract MI related features of all time period EEG signals within the MI task and helps improving the classification performance of MI. The proposed TFSOFF exhibits superior performance in comparison with several competing methods. The proposed method is a suitable method for improving the performance of MI-based BCIs."

Traditional feature extraction and classification methods require to reshape the data into vectors that results in losing the structural information exist in the original featured matrix. The aim of this work is to design an efficient approach for robust feature extraction and classification for the classification of EEG signals. In order to extract robust feature matrix and reduce the dimensionality of from original epileptic EEG data, in this paper, we have applied robust joint sparse PCA (RJSPCA), Outliers Robust PCA (ORPCA) and compare their performance with different matrix base feature extraction methods, followed by classification through support matrix machine. The combination of joint sparse PCA with robust support matrix machine showed good generalization performance for classification of EEG data due to their convex optimization. A comprehensive experimental study on the publicly available EEG datasets is carried out to validate the robustness of the proposed approach against outliers. The experiment results, supported by the theoretical analysis and statistical test, show the effectiveness of the proposed framework for solving classification of EEG signals."
32305926,"The accuracy of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is important for effective communication and control. The mu-based BCI is one of the most widely used systems, of which the related methods to improve users' accuracy are still poorly studied, especially for the BCI illiteracy. Here, we examined a way to enhance mu-based BCI performance by electrically stimulating the ulnar nerve of the contralateral wrist at the alpha frequency (10 Hz) during left- and right-hand motor imagination in two BCI groups (literate and illiterate). We demonstrate that this alpha frequency intervention enhances the classification accuracy between left- and right-hand motor imagery from 66.41% to 81.57% immediately after intervention and to 75.28% two days after intervention in the BCI illiteracy group, while classification accuracy improves from 82.12% to 91.84% immediately after intervention and to 89.03% two days after intervention in the BCI literacy group. However, the classification accuracy did not change before and after the sham intervention (no electrical stimulation). Furthermore, the ERD on the primary sensorimotor cortex during left- or right-hand motor imagery tasks was more visible at the mu-rhythm (8-13 Hz) after alpha frequency intervention. Alpha frequency intervention increases the mu-rhythm power difference between left- and right-hand motor imagery tasks. These results provide evidence that alpha frequency intervention is an effective way to improve BCI performance by regulating the mu-rhythm which might provide a way to reduce BCI illiteracy."
32299441,"Generally, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) require calibration before usage to ensure efficient performance. Therefore, each BCI user has to attend a certain number of calibration sessions to be able to use the system. However, such calibration requirements may be difficult to fulfill especially for patients with disabilities. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic transfer learning approach to reduce the calibration requirements of our EEG-fTCD hybrid BCI designed using motor imagery (MI) and flickering mental rotation (MR)/word generation (WG) paradigms. The proposed approach identifies the top similar datasets from previous BCI users to a small training dataset collected from a current BCI user and uses these datasets to augment the training data of the current BCI user. To achieve such an aim, EEG and fTCD feature vectors of each trial were projected into scalar scores using support vector machines. EEG and fTCD class conditional distributions were learnt separately using the scores of each class. Bhattacharyya distance was used to identify similarities between class conditional distributions obtained using training trials of the current BCI user and those obtained using trials of previous users. Experimental results showed that the performance obtained using the proposed transfer learning approach outperforms the performance obtained without transfer learning for both MI and flickering MR/WG paradigms. In particular, it was found that the calibration requirements can be reduced by at least 60.43% for the MI paradigm, while at most a reduction of 17.31% can be achieved for the MR/WG paradigm. Data collected using the MI paradigm show better generalization across subjects."
32283388,"Electroencephalograph (EEG) classification is an important technology that can establish a mapping relationship between EEG features and cognitive tasks. Emerging matrix classifiers have been successfully applied to motor imagery (MI) EEG classification, but they belong to shallow classifiers, making powerful stacked generalization principle not exploited for automatically learning deep EEG features. To learn the high-level representation and abstraction, we proposed a novel deep stacked support matrix machine (DSSMM) to improve the performance of existing shallow matrix classifiers in EEG classification. The main idea of our framework is founded on the stacked generalization principle, where support matrix machine (SMM) is introduced as the basic building block of deep stacked network. The weak predictions of all previous layers obtained via SMM are randomly projected to help move apart the manifold of the original input EEG feature, and then the newly generated features are fed into the next layer of DSSMM. The framework only involves an efficient feed-forward rather than parameter fine-tuning with backpropagation, each layer of which is a convex optimization problem, thus simplifying the objective function solving process. Extensive experiments on three public EEG datasets and a self-collected EEG dataset are conducted. Experimental results demonstrate that our DSSMM outperforms the available state-of-the-art methods. The proposed DSSMM inherits the characteristic of matrix classifiers that can learn the structural information of data as well as the powerful capability of deep representation learning, which makes it adapted to classify complex matrix-form EEG data."
32283387,"Brain-computer interfaces build a communication pathway from the human brain to a computer. Motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (EEG) classification is a widely applied paradigm in brain-computer interfaces. The common spatial pattern, based on the event-related desynchronization (ERD)/event-related synchronization (ERS) phenomenon, is one of the most popular algorithms for motor imagery-based EEG classification. Moreover, the spatiotemporal discrepancy feature based on the event-related potential phenomenon has been demonstrated to provide complementary information to ERD/ERS-based features. In this paper, aiming to improve the performance of motor imagery-based EEG classification in a few-channel situation, an ensemble support vector learning (ESVL)-based approach is proposed to combine the advantages of the ERD/ERS-based features and the event-related potential-based features in motor imagery-based EEG classification. ESVL is an ensemble learning algorithm based on support vector machine classifier. Specifically, the decision boundary with the largest interclass margin is obtained using the support vector machine algorithm, and the distances between sample points and the decision boundary are mapped to posterior probabilities. The probabilities obtained from different support vector machine classifiers are combined to make prediction. Thus, ESVL leverages the advantages of multiple trained support vector machine classifiers and makes a better prediction based on the posterior probabilities. The class discrepancy-guided sub-band-based common spatial pattern and the spatiotemporal discrepancy feature are applied to extract discriminative features, and then, the extracted features are used to train the ESVL classifier and make predictions. The BCI Competition IV datasets 2a and 2b are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed ESVL algorithm. Experimental comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods are performed, and the proposed ESVL-based approach achieves an average max kappa value of 0.60 and 0.71 on BCI Competition IV datasets 2a and 2b respectively. The results show that the proposed ESVL-based approach improves the performance of motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces. The proposed ESVL classifier could use the posterior probabilities to realize ensemble learning and the ESVL-based motor imagery classification approach takes advantage of the merits of ERD/ERS based feature and event-related potential based feature to improve the experimental performance."
32283182,"This study aims to investigate the difference in cortical signal characteristics between the left and right foot imaginary movements and to improve the classification accuracy of the experimental tasks. Raw signals were gathered from 64-channel scalp electroencephalograms of 11 healthy participants. Firstly, the cortical source model was defined with 62 regions of interest over the sensorimotor cortex (nine Brodmann areas). Secondly, functional connectivity was calculated by phase lock value for α and β rhythm networks. Thirdly, network-based statistics were applied to identify whether there existed stable and significant subnetworks that formed between the two types of motor imagery tasks. Meanwhile, ten graph theory indices were investigated for each network by t-test to determine statistical significance between tasks. Finally, sparse multinomial logistic regression (SMLR)-support vector machine (SVM), as a feature selection and classification model, was used to analyze the graph theory features. The specific time-frequency (α event-related desynchronization and β event-related synchronization) difference network between the two tasks was congregated at the midline and demonstrated significant connections in the premotor areas and primary somatosensory cortex. A few of statistically significant differences in the network properties were observed between tasks in the α and β rhythm. The SMLR-SVM classification model achieved fair discrimination accuracy between imaginary movements of the two feet (maximum 75% accuracy rate in single-trial analyses). This study reveals the network mechanism of the discrimination of the left and right foot motor imagery, which can provide a novel avenue for the BCI system by unilateral lower limb motor imagery."
32259927,"In recent years, Brain Computer Interface (BCI) based on motor imagery has been widely used in the fields of medicine, active safe systems for automobiles, entertainment, and so on. Motor imagery relevant electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are weak, nonlinear, and susceptible to interference. As a feature extraction method for motor imagery, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) has been proven to be very effective. However, its effectiveness depends heavily on the choice of frequency bands, and Euclidean space cannot effectively describe the inner relationship. To solve these problems, a classification approach for motor imagery using the Geodesic Filtering Common Spatial Pattern (GFCSP) and filter-bank Feature Weighted Support Vector Machine (FWSVM) is presented. First, GFCSP based on the Riemannian manifold is proposed, in which the extracted covariance features are spatially filtered in Riemannian tangent space, and the average covariance matrix is replaced by Riemannian mean in CSP. Second, filter-bank FWSVM with a feature weighted matrix is proposed. EEG signals are filtered into 8-12 Hz, 12-16 Hz, 18-22 Hz, 22-26 Hz, and a wide band of 8-24 Hz, and GFCSP features of these filtered signals are extracted. A feature weighted matrix is calculated using mutual information and the Pearson correlation coefficient from these features and class information. Then, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for classification with the feature weighted matrix. Finally, the proposed method is validated on the dataset IVa in BCI competition III. Classification accuracies of the five subjects are 92.31%, 99.03%, 80.36%, 96.30%, and 97.67%, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."
32257126,"Classification of Motor Imagery (MI) signals is the heart of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) based applications. Spatial filtering is an important step in this process that produce new set of signals for better discrimination of two classes of EEG signals. In this work, a new approach of spatial filtering called Space-Frequency Localized Spatial Filtering (SFLSF) is proposed to enhance the performances of MI classification. The SFLSF method initially divides the scalp-EEG channels into local overlapping spatial windows. Then a filter bank is used to divide the signals into local frequency bands. The group of channels, localized in space and frequency, are then processed with spatial filter, and features are subsequently extracted for classification task. Experimental results corroborate that the proposed space localization helps to increase the classification accuracy when compared to the existing methods using spatial filters. The classification performance is further improved when frequency localization is incorporated. Thus, the proposed space-frequency localized approach of spatial filtering helps to deliver better classification result which is consistently 3-5% higher than traditional methods."
32256550,"Recent technological advances have enabled researchers to collect large amounts of electroencephalography (EEG) signals in labeled and unlabeled datasets. It is expensive and time consuming to collect labeled EEG data for use in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, however. In this paper, a novel active learning method is proposed to minimize the amount of labeled, subject-specific EEG data required for effective classifier training, by combining measures of uncertainty and representativeness within an extreme learning machine (ELM). Following this approach, an ELM classifier was first used to select a relatively large batch of unlabeled examples, whose uncertainty was measured through the best-versus-second-best (BvSB) strategy. The diversity of each sample was then measured between the limited labeled training data and previously selected unlabeled samples, and similarity is measured among the previously selected samples. Finally, a tradeoff parameter is introduced to control the balance between informative and representative samples, and these samples are then used to construct a powerful ELM classifier. Extensive experiments were conducted using benchmark and multiclass motor imagery EEG datasets to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the performance of the new algorithm exceeds or matches those of several state-of-the-art active learning algorithms. It is thereby shown that the proposed method improves classifier performance and reduces the need for training samples in BCI applications."
32248089,"This randomized controlled feasibility study investigates the ability for clinical application of the Brain-Computer Interface-based Soft Robotic Glove (BCI-SRG) incorporating activities of daily living (ADL)-oriented tasks for stroke rehabilitation. Eleven recruited chronic stroke patients were randomized into BCI-SRG or Soft Robotic Glove (SRG) group. Each group underwent 120-minute intervention per session comprising 30-minute standard arm therapy and 90-minute experimental therapy (BCI-SRG or SRG). To perform ADL tasks, BCI-SRG group used motor imagery-BCI and SRG, while SRG group used SRG without motor imagery-BCI. Both groups received 18 sessions of intervention over 6 weeks. Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (FMA) and Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) scores were measured at baseline (week 0), post- intervention (week 6), and follow-ups (week 12 and 24). In total, 10/11 patients completed the study with 5 in each group and 1 dropped out. Though there were no significant intergroup differences for FMA and ARAT during 6-week intervention, the improvement of FMA and ARAT seemed to sustain beyond 6-week intervention for BCI-SRG group, as compared with SRG control. Incidentally, all BCI-SRG subjects reported a sense of vivid movement of the stroke-impaired upper limb and 3/5 had this phenomenon persisting beyond intervention while none of SRG did. BCI-SRG suggested probable trends of sustained functional improvements with peculiar kinesthetic experience outlasting active intervention in chronic stroke despite the dire need for large-scale investigations to verify statistical significance. Addition of BCI to soft robotic training for ADL-oriented stroke rehabilitation holds promise for sustained improvements as well as elicited perception of motor movements."
32226566,"Motor imagery (MI) is a mental representation of motor behavior and has been widely used in electroencephalogram based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of MI-based BCI-feedback training in post-stroke rehabilitation. However, in the earliest stage of the training, calibration data typically contain insufficient discriminability, resulting in unreliable feedback, which may decrease subjects' motivation and even hinder their training. To improve the performance in the early stages of MI training, a novel hybrid BCI paradigm based on MI and P300 is proposed in this study. In this paradigm, subjects are instructed to imagine writing the Chinese character following the flash order of the desired Chinese character displayed on the screen. The event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) phenomenon is produced with writing based on one's imagination. Simultaneously, the P300 potential is evoked by the flash of each stroke. Moreover, a fusion method of P300 and MI classification is proposed, in which unreliable P300 classifications are corrected by reliable MI classifications. Twelve healthy naïve MI subjects participated in this study. Results demonstrated that the proposed hybrid BCI paradigm yielded significantly better performance than the single-modality BCI paradigm. The recognition accuracy of the fusion method is significantly higher than that of P300 (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and MI (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Moreover, the training data size can be reduced through fusion of these two modalities."
32226230,"The non-stationary nature of electroencephalography (EEG) signals makes an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) a dynamic system, thus improving its performance is a challenging task. In addition, it is well-known that due to non-stationarity based covariate shifts, the input data distributions of EEG-based BCI systems change during inter- and intra-session transitions, which poses great difficulty for developments of online adaptive data-driven systems. Ensemble learning approaches have been used previously to tackle this challenge. However, passive scheme based implementation leads to poor efficiency while increasing high computational cost. This paper presents a novel integration of covariate shift estimation and unsupervised adaptive ensemble learning (CSE-UAEL) to tackle non-stationarity in motor-imagery (MI) related EEG classification. The proposed method first employs an exponentially weighted moving average model to detect the covariate shifts in the common spatial pattern features extracted from MI related brain responses. Then, a classifier ensemble was created and updated over time to account for changes in streaming input data distribution wherein new classifiers are added to the ensemble in accordance with estimated shifts. Furthermore, using two publicly available BCI-related EEG datasets, the proposed method was extensively compared with the state-of-the-art single-classifier based passive scheme, single-classifier based active scheme and ensemble based passive schemes. The experimental results show that the proposed active scheme based ensemble learning algorithm significantly enhances the BCI performance in MI classifications."
32187208,"It has been demonstrated that the performance of typical unimodal brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can be noticeably improved by combining two different BCI modalities. This so-called ""hybrid BCI"" technology has been studied for decades; however, hybrid BCIs that particularly combine electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) (hereafter referred to as hBCIs) have not been widely used in practical settings. One of the main reasons why hBCI systems are so unpopular is that their hardware is generally too bulky and complex. Therefore, to make hBCIs more appealing, it is necessary to implement a lightweight and compact hBCI system with minimal performance degradation. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of implementing a compact hBCI system with significantly less EEG channels and fNIRS source-detector (SD) pairs, but that can achieve a classification accuracy high enough to be used in practical BCI applications. EEG and fNIRS data were acquired while participants performed three different mental tasks consisting of mental arithmetic, right-hand motor imagery, and an idle state. Our analysis results showed that the three mental states could be classified with a fairly high classification accuracy of 77.6 ± 12.1% using an hBCI system with only two EEG channels and two fNIRS SD pairs."
32185216,"Motor imagery brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have demonstrated great potential and attract world-spread attentions. Due to the nonstationary character of the motor imagery signals, costly and boring calibration sessions must be proceeded before use. This prevents them from going into our realistic life. In this paper, the source subject's data are explored to perform calibration for target subjects. Model trained on source subjects is transferred to work for target subjects, in which the critical problem to handle is the distribution shift. It is found that the performance of classification would be bad when only the marginal distributions of source and target are made closer, since the discriminative directions of the source and target domains may still be much different. In order to solve the problem, our idea comes that joint distribution adaptation is indispensable. It makes the classifier trained in the source domain perform well in the target domain. Specifically, a measure for joint distribution discrepancy (JDD) between the source and target is proposed. Experiments demonstrate that it can align source and target data according to the class they belong to. It has a direct relationship with classification accuracy and works well for transferring. Secondly, a deep neural network with joint distribution matching for zero-training motor imagery BCI is proposed. It explores both marginal and joint distribution adaptation to alleviate distribution discrepancy across subjects and obtain effective and generalized features in an aligned common space. Visualizations of intermediate layers illustrate how and why the network works well. Experiments on the two datasets prove the effectiveness and strength compared to outstanding counterparts."
32183285,"Optimizing neurofeedback (NF) and brain-computer interface (BCI) implementations constitutes a challenge across many fields and has so far been addressed by, among others, advancing signal processing methods or predicting the user's control ability from neurophysiological or psychological measures. In comparison, how context factors influence NF/BCI performance is largely unexplored. We here investigate whether a competitive multi-user condition leads to better NF/BCI performance than a single-user condition. We implemented a foot motor imagery (MI) NF with mobile electroencephalography (EEG). Twenty-five healthy, young participants steered a humanoid robot in a single-user condition and in a competitive multi-user race condition using a second humanoid robot and a pseudo competitor. NF was based on 8-30 Hz relative event-related desynchronization (ERD) over sensorimotor areas. There was no significant difference between the ERD during the competitive multi-user condition and the single-user condition but considerable inter-individual differences regarding which condition yielded a stronger ERD. Notably, the stronger condition could be predicted from the participants' MI-induced ERD obtained before the NF blocks. Our findings may contribute to enhance the performance of NF/BCI implementations and highlight the necessity of individualizing context factors."
32182270,"The left and right foot representation area is located within the interhemispheric fissure of the sensorimotor cortex and share spatial proximity. This makes it difficult to visualize the cortical lateralization of event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) during left and right foot motor imageries. The aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of using ERD/ERS in the mu, low beta, and high beta bandwidth, during left and right foot dorsiflexion kinaesthetic motor imageries (KMI), as unilateral control commands for a brain-computer interface (BCI). EEG was recorded from nine healthy participants during cue-based left-right foot dorsiflexion KMI tasks. The features were analysed for common average and bipolar references. With each reference, mu and beta band-power features were analysed using time-frequency (TF) maps, scalp topographies, and average time course for ERD/ERS. The cortical lateralization of ERD/ERS, during left and right foot KMI, was confirmed. Statistically significant features were classified using LDA, SVM, and KNN model, and evaluated using the area under ROC curves. An increase in high beta power following the end of KMI for both tasks was recorded, from right and left hemispheres, respectively, at the vertex. The single trial analysis and classification models resulted in high discrimination accuracies, i.e. maximum 83.4% for beta ERS, 79.1% for beta ERD, and 74.0% for mu ERD. With each model the features performed above the statistical chance level of 2-class discrimination for a BCI. Our findings indicate these features can evoke left-right differences in single EEG trials. This suggests that any BCI employing unilateral foot KMI can attain classification accuracy suitable for practical implementation. Given results stipulate the novel utilization of mu and beta as independent control features for discrimination of bilateral foot KMI in a BCI."
32174331,"This paper presents a self-paced brain-computer interface (BCI) based on the incorporation of an intelligent environment-understanding approach into a motor imagery (MI) BCI system for rehabilitation hospital environmental control. The interface integrates four types of daily assistance tasks: medical calls, service calls, appliance control and catering services. The system introduces intelligent environment understanding technology to establish preliminary predictions concerning a user's control intention by extracting potential operational objects in the current environment through an object detection neural network. According to the characteristics of the four types of control and services, we establish different response mechanisms and use an intelligent decision-making method to design and dynamically optimize the relevant control instruction set. The control feedback is communicated to the user via voice prompts; it avoids the use of visual channels throughout the interaction. The asynchronous and synchronous modes of the MI-BCI are designed to launch the control process and to select specific operations, respectively. In particular, the reliability of the MI-BCI is enhanced by the optimized identification algorithm. An online experiment demonstrated that the system can respond quickly and it generates an activation command in an average of 3.38s while effectively preventing false activations; the average accuracy of the BCI synchronization commands was 89.2%, which represents sufficiently effective control. The proposed system is efficient, applicable and can be used to both improve system information throughput and to reduce mental loads. The proposed system can be used to assist with the daily lives of patients with severe motor impairments."
32167903,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) system usually needs a long calibration session for each new subject/task to adjust its parameters, which impedes its transition from the laboratory to real-world applications. Domain adaptation, which leverages labeled data from auxiliary subjects/tasks (source domains), has demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing such calibration effort. Currently, most domain adaptation approaches require the source domains to have the same feature space and label space as the target domain, which limits their applications, as the auxiliary data may have different feature spaces and/or different label spaces. This paper considers different set domain adaptation for BCIs, i.e., the source and target domains have different label spaces. We introduce a practical setting of different label sets for BCIs, and propose a novel label alignment (LA) approach to align the source label space with the target label space. It has three desirable properties: 1) LA only needs as few as one labeled sample from each class of the target subject; 2) LA can be used as a preprocessing step before different feature extraction and classification algorithms; and, 3) LA can be integrated with other domain adaptation approaches to achieve even better performance. Experiments on two motor imagery datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of LA."
32164860,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provide an important complement to other noninvasive BCIs. While fMRI has several disadvantages (being nonportable, methodologically challenging, costly, and noisy), it is the only method providing high spatial resolution whole-brain coverage of brain activation. These properties allow relating mental activities to specific brain regions and networks providing a transparent scheme for BCI users to encode information and for real-time fMRI BCI systems to decode the intents of the user. Various mental activities have been used successfully in fMRI BCIs so far that can be classified into the four categories: (a) higher-order cognitive tasks (e.g., mental calculation), (b) covert language-related tasks (e.g., mental speech and mental singing), (c) imagery tasks (motor, visual, auditory, tactile, and emotion imagery), and (d) selective attention tasks (visual, auditory, and tactile attention). While the ultimate spatial and temporal resolution of fMRI BCIs is limited by the physiologic properties of the hemodynamic response, technical and analytical advances will likely lead to substantially improved fMRI BCIs in the future using, for example, decoding of imagined letter shapes at 7T as the basis for more ""natural"" communication BCIs."
32164848,"Patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) suffer from awareness deficits. Comorbidities such as motor disabilities or visual problems hamper clinical assessments, which can lead to misdiagnosis of the level of consciousness and render the patient unable to communicate. Objective measures of consciousness can reduce the risk of misdiagnosis and could enable patients to communicate by voluntarily modulating their brain activity. This chapter gives an overview of the literature regarding brain-computer interface (BCI) research in DOC patients. Different auditory, visual, and motor imagery paradigms are discussed, alongside their corresponding advantages and disadvantages. At this point, the use of BCIs for DOC patients in clinical applications is still preliminary. However, perspectives on the improvements in BCIs for DOC patients seem positive, and implementation during rehabilitation shows promise."
32164846,"The brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for neurologic rehabilitation are based on the assumption that by retraining the brain to specific activities, an ultimate improvement of function can be expected. In this chapter, we review the present status, key determinants, and future directions of the clinical use of BCI in neurorehabilitation. The recent advancements in noninvasive BCIs as a therapeutic tool to promote functional motor recovery by inducing neuroplasticity are described, focusing on stroke as it represents the major cause of long-term motor disability. The relevance of recent findings on BCI use in spinal cord injury beyond the control of neuroprosthetic devices to restore motor function is briefly discussed. In a dedicated section, we examine the potential role of BCI technology in the domain of cognitive function recovery by instantiating BCIs in the long history of neurofeedback and some emerging BCI paradigms to address cognitive rehabilitation are highlighted. Despite the knowledge acquired over the last decade and the growing number of studies providing evidence for clinical efficacy of BCI in motor rehabilitation, an exhaustive deployment of this technology in clinical practice is still on its way. The pipeline to translate BCI to clinical practice in neurorehabilitation is the subject of this chapter."
32154404,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are technologies that provide the user with an alternative way of communication. A BCI measures brain activity (e.g. EEG) and converts it into output commands. Motor imagery (MI), the mental simulation of movements, can be used as a BCI paradigm, where the movement intention of the user can be translated into a real movement, helping patients in motor recovery rehabilitation. One of the main limitations for the broad use of such devices is the high cost associated with the high-quality equipment used for capturing the biomedical signals. Different low-cost consumer-grade alternatives have emerged with the objective of bringing these systems closer to the final users. The quality of the signals obtained with such equipments has already been evaluated and found to be competitive with those obtained with well-known clinical-grade devices. However, how these consumer-grade technologies can be integrated and used for practical MI-BCIs has not yet been explored. In this work, we provide a detailed description of the advantages and disadvantages of using OpenBCI boards, low-cost sensors and open-source software for constructing an entirely consumer-grade MI-BCI system. An analysis of the quality of the signals acquired and the MI detection ability is performed. Even though communication between the computer and the OpenBCI board is not always stable and the signal quality is sometimes affected by ambient noise, we find that by means of a filter-bank based method, similar classification performances can be achieved with an MI-BCI built under low-cost consumer-grade devices as compared to when clinical-grade systems are used. By means of this work we share with the BCI community our experience on working with emerging low-cost technologies, providing evidence that an entirely low-cost MI-BCI can be built. We believe that if communication stability and artifact rejection are improved, these technologies will become a valuable alternative to clinical-grade devices."
32149648,"Common spatial pattern (CSP) is an efficient algorithm widely used in feature extraction of EEG-based motor imagery classification. Traditional CSP depends only on spatial filtering, that aims to maximize or minimize the ratio of variances of filtered EEG signals in different classes. Recent advances of CSP approaches show that temporal filtering is also preferable to extract discriminative features. In view of this perspective, a novel spatio-temporal filtering strategy is proposed in this paper. To improve computational efficiency and alleviate the overfitting issue frequently encountered in the case of small sample size, the same temporal filter is designed by EEG signals of the same class and shared by all the spatial channels. Spatial and temporal filters can be updated alternatively in practice. Furthermore, each of the resulting designs can still be cast as a CSP problem and tackled efficiently by the eigenvalue decomposition. To alleviate the adverse effects of outliers or noisy EEG channels, sparse spatial or temporal filters can also be achieved by incorporating an l<sub>1</sub> -norm-based regularization term in our CSP problem. The regularized spatial or temporal filter design is iteratively reformulated as a CSP problem via the reweighting technique. Two sets of motor imagery EEG data of BCI competitions are used in our experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."
32149645,"Neural correlates of intentionally induced human emotions may offer alternative imagery strategies to control brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. In this paper, a novel BCI control strategy i.e., imagining fictional or recalling mnemonic sad and happy events, emotion-inducing imagery (EII), is compared to motor imagery (MI) in a study involving multiple sessions using a two-class electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI paradigm with 12 participants. The BCI setup enabled online continuous visual feedback presentation in a game involving one-dimensional control of a game character. MI and EII are compared across different signal-processing frameworks which are based on neural-time-series-prediction-preprocessing (NTSPP), filter bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP) and hemispheric asymmetry (ASYM). Online single-trial classification accuracies (CA) results indicate that MI performance across all participants is 77.54% compared to EII performance of 68.78% ( ). The results show that an ensemble of the NTSPP, FBCSP and ASYM frameworks maximizes performance for EII with average CA of 71.64% across all participants. Furthermore, the participants' subjective responses indicate that they preferred MI over emotion-inducing imagery (EII) in controlling the game character, and MI was perceived to offer most control over the game character. The results suggest that EII is not a viable alternative to MI for the majority of participants in this study but may be an alternative imagery for a subset of BCI users based on acceptable EII performance (CA >70%) observed for some participants."
32143794,"A subject of extensive research interest in the Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) niche is motor imagery (MI), where users imagine limb movements to control the system. This interest is owed to the immense potential for its applicability in gaming, neuro-prosthetics and neuro-rehabilitation, where the user's thoughts of imagined movements need to be decoded. Electroencephalography (EEG) equipment is commonly used for keeping track of cerebrum movement in BCI systems. The EEG signals are recognized by feature extraction and classification. The current research proposes a Hybrid-KELM (Kernel Extreme Learning Machine) method based on PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and FLD (Fisher's Linear Discriminant) for MI BCI classification of EEG data. The performance and results of the method are demonstrated using BCI competition dataset III, and compared with those of contemporary methods. The proposed method generated an accuracy of 96.54%."
32132910,"Traditional rehabilitation techniques present limitations and the majority of patients show poor 1-year post-stroke recovery. Thus, Neurofeedback (NF) or Brain-Computer-Interface applications for stroke rehabilitation purposes are gaining increased attention. Indeed, NF has the potential to enhance volitional control of targeted cortical areas and thus impact on motor function recovery. However, current implementations are limited by temporal, spatial or practical constraints of the specific imaging modality used. In this pilot work and for the first time in literature, we applied bimodal EEG-fMRI NF for upper limb stroke recovery on four stroke-patients with different stroke characteristics and motor impairment severity. We also propose a novel, multi-target training approach that guides the training towards the activation of the ipsilesional primary motor cortex. In addition to fMRI and EEG outcomes, we assess the integrity of the corticospinal tract (CST) with tractography. Preliminary results suggest the feasibility of our approach and show its potential to induce an augmented activation of ipsilesional motor areas, depending on the severity of the stroke deficit. Only the two patients with a preserved CST and subcortical lesions succeeded in upregulating the ipsilesional primary motor cortex and exhibited a functional improvement of upper limb motricity. These findings highlight the importance of taking into account the variability of the stroke patients' population and enabled to identify inclusion criteria for the design of future clinical studies."
32132894,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are becoming increasingly popular as a tool to improve the quality of life of patients with disabilities. Recently, time-resolved functional near-infrared spectroscopy (TR-fNIRS) based BCIs are gaining traction because of their enhanced depth sensitivity leading to lower signal contamination from the extracerebral layers. This study presents the first account of TR-fNIRS based BCI for ""mental communication"" on healthy participants. Twenty-one (21) participants were recruited and were repeatedly asked a series of questions where they were instructed to imagine playing tennis for ""yes"" and to stay relaxed for ""no."" The change in the mean time-of-flight of photons was used to calculate the change in concentrations of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin since it provides a good compromise between depth sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio. Features were extracted from the average oxyhemoglobin signals to classify them as ""yes"" or ""no"" responses. Linear-discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were used to classify the responses using the leave-one-out cross-validation method. The overall accuracies achieved for all participants were 75% and 76%, using LDA and SVM, respectively. The results also reveal that there is no significant difference in accuracy between questions. In addition, physiological parameters [heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP)] were recorded on seven of the 21 participants during motor imagery (MI) and rest to investigate changes in these parameters between conditions. No significant difference in these parameters was found between conditions. These findings suggest that TR-fNIRS could be suitable as a BCI for patients with brain injuries."
32078552,"A low-cost Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) based on electroencephalography for lower-limb motor recovery of post-stroke patients is proposed here, which provides passive pedaling as feedback, when patients trigger a Mini-Motorized Exercise Bike (MMEB) by executing pedaling motor imagery (MI). This system was validated in an On-line phase by eight healthy subjects and two post-stroke patients, which felt a closed-loop commanding the MMEB due to the fast response of our BMI. It was developed using methods of low-computational cost, such as Riemannian geometry for feature extraction, Pair-Wise Feature Proximity (PWFP) for feature selection, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for pedaling imagery recognition. The On-line phase was composed of two sessions, where each participant completed a total of 12 trials per session executing pedaling MI for triggering the MMEB. As a result, the MMEB was successfully triggered by healthy subjects for almost all trials (ACC up to 100%), while the two post-stroke patients, PS1 and PS2, achieved their best performance (ACC of 41.67% and 91.67%, respectively) in Session #2. These patients improved their latency (2.03 ± 0.42 s and 1.99 ± 0.35 s, respectively) when triggering the MMEB, and their performance suggests the hypothesis that our system may be used with chronic stroke patients for lower-limb recovery, providing neural relearning and enhancing neuroplasticity."
32038198,"Neurofeedback-guided motor-imagery training (NF-MIT) has been proposed as a promising intervention following upper limb motor impairment. In this intervention, paretic stroke patients receive online feedback about their brain activity while conducting a motor-imagery (MI) task with the paretic limb. Typically, the feedback provided in NF-MIT protocols is an abstract visual signal based on a fixed trial. Here we developed a self-paced NF-MIT paradigm with an embodiable feedback signal (EFS), which was designed to resemble the content of the mental act as closely as possible. To this end, the feedback was delivered <i>via</i> an embodiable, anthropomorphic robotic hand (RH), which was integrated into a closed-looped EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI). Whenever the BCI identified a new instance of a hand-flexion or hand-extension imagination by the participant, the RH carried out the corresponding movement with minimum delay. Nine stroke patients and nine healthy participants were instructed to control RH movements as accurately as possible, using mental activity alone. We evaluated the general feasibility of our paradigm on electrophysiological, subjective and performance levels. Regarding electrophysiological measures, individuals showed the predicted event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns over sensorimotor brain areas. On the subjective level, we found that most individuals integrated the RH into their body scheme. With respect to RH control, none of our participants achieved a high level of control, but most managed to control the RH actions to some degree. Importantly, patients and controls achieved similar performance levels. The results support the view that self-paced embodiable NF-MIT is feasible for stroke patients and can complement classical NF-MIT."
32034277,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow control of various applications or external devices solely by brain activity, e.g., measured by electroencephalography during motor imagery. Many users are unable to modulate their brain activity sufficiently in order to control a BCI. Most of the studies have been focusing on improving the accuracy of BCI control through advances in signal processing and BCI protocol modification. However, some research suggests that motor skills and physiological factors may affect BCI performance as well. Previous studies have indicated that there is differential lateralization of hand movements' neural representation in right- and left-handed individuals. However, the effects of handedness on sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) distribution and BCI control have not been investigated in detail yet. Our study aims to fill this gap, by comparing the SMR patterns during motor imagery and real-feedback BCI control in right- (N = 20) and left-handers (N = 20). The results of our study show that the lateralization of SMR during a motor imagery task differs according to handedness. Left-handers present lower accuracy during BCI performance (single session) and weaker SMR suppression in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) during mental simulation of left-hand movements. Consequently, to improve BCI control, the user's training should take into account individual differences in hand dominance."
32028964,"Even though the BCI field has quickly grown in the last few years, it is still mainly investigated as a research area. Increased practicality and usability are required to move BCIs to the real-world. Self-paced (SP) systems would reduce the problem but there is still the big challenge of what is known as the 'onset detection problem'. Our previous studies showed how a new sound-imagery (SI) task, high-tone covert sound production, is very effective for onset detection scenarios and we expect there are several advantages over most common asynchronous approaches used thus far, i.e., motor-imagery (MI): 1) Intuitiveness; 2) benefits to people with motor disabilities and, especially, those with lesions on cortical motor areas; and 3) no significant overlap with other common, spontaneous cognitive states, making it easier to use in daily-life situations. The approach was compared with MI tasks in online real-life scenarios, i.e., during activities such as watching videos and reading text. In our scenario, when a new message prompt from a messenger program appeared on the screen, participants watching a video (or reading text, browsing images) were asked to open the message by executing the SI or MI tasks, respectively, for each experimental condition. The results showed the SI task performed statistically significantly better than the MI approach: 84.04% (SI) vs 66.79 (MI) True-False positive rate for the sliding image scenario, 80.84% vs 61.07% for watching video. The classification performance difference between SI and MI was found not to be significant in the text-reading scenario. Furthermore, the onset response speed showed SI (4.08 s) being significantly faster than MI (5.46 s). In terms of basic usability, 75% of subjects found SI easier to use. Our novel SI task outperforms typical MI for SP onset detection BCIs, therefore it would be more easily used in daily-life situations. This could be a significant step forward for the BCI field which has so far been mainly restricted to research-oriented indoor laboratory settings."
32015227,"Designing an effective classifier with high classification accuracy and strong generalization capability is essential for brain-computer interface (BCI) research. In this study, an extreme learning machine (ELM) based method is proposed to improve the classification accuracy of motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG). The proposed method constructs an ensemble classifier based on optimized ELMs. Particle swarm optimization is used to simultaneously optimize the input weights and hidden biases of ELM to avoid the randomness and instability of classification result when ELM uses randomly generated parameters, and majority voting strategy is used to fuse the classification results of multiple base classifiers to avoid the negative impact of ELM with local optimal parameters on classification result. The proposed method was compared with four competing methods in experiments based on two public EEG datasets and some existing methods reported in the literature using the same datasets as well. The results indicate that the proposed method achieved significant higher classification accuracies than those of the competing methods on both two-class and four-class motor imagery data. Moreover, compared to the existing methods, it still obtained superior average accuracies of two-class classification and performed better for the subjects with relatively poor accuracies on both two-class and four-class classifications. The significant accuracy improvement demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method. It can be a promising candidate for accurate classification of motor imagery EEG in BCI systems."
31985451,"Achieving high classification performance in electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) often entails a large number of channels, which impedes their use in practical applications. Despite the previous efforts, it remains a challenge to determine the optimal subset of channels in a subject-specific manner without heavily compromising the classification performance. In this article, we propose a new method, called spatiotemporal-filtering-based channel selection (STECS), to automatically identify a designated number of discriminative channels by leveraging the spatiotemporal information of the EEG data. In STECS, the channel selection problem is cast under the framework of spatiotemporal filter optimization by incorporating a group sparsity constraints, and a computationally efficient algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem. The performance of STECS is assessed on three motor imagery EEG datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art spatiotemporal filtering algorithms using full EEG channels, STECS yields comparable classification performance with only half of the channels. Moreover, STECS significantly outperforms the existing channel selection methods. These results suggest that this algorithm holds promise for simplifying BCI setups and facilitating practical utility."
31976916,"Motor imagery classification from EEG signals is essential for motor rehabilitation with a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). Most current works on this issue require a subject-specific adaptation step before applied to a new user. Thus the research of directly extending a pre-trained model to new users is particularly desired and indispensable. As brain dynamics fluctuate considerably across different subjects, it is challenging to design practical hand-crafted features based on prior knowledge. Regarding this gap, this paper proposes a Graph-based Convolutional Recurrent Attention Model (G-CRAM) to explore EEG features across different subjects for motor imagery classification. A graph structure is first developed to represent the positioning information of EEG nodes. Then a convolutional recurrent attention model learns EEG features from both spatial and temporal dimensions and emphasizes on the most distinguishable temporal periods. We evaluate the proposed approach on two benchmark EEG datasets of motor imagery classification on the subject-independent testing. The results show that the G-CRAM achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods regarding recognition accuracy and ROC-AUC. Furthermore, model interpretation studies reveal the learning process of different neural network components and demonstrate that the proposed model can extract detailed features efficiently."
31973155,"Motor imagery has been suggested as an efficient alternative to improve the rehabilitation process of affected limbs. In this study, a low-cost robotic guide is implemented so that linear position can be controlled via the user's motor imagination of movement intention. The patient can use this device to move the arm attached to the guide according to their own intentions. The first objective of this study was to check the feasibility and safety of the designed robotic guide controlled via a motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) in healthy individuals, with the ultimate aim to apply it to rehabilitation patients. The second objective was to determine which are the most convenient MI strategies to control the different assisted rehabilitation arm movements. The results of this study show a better performance when the BCI task is controlled with an action-action MI strategy versus an action-relaxation one. No statistically significant difference was found between the two action-action MI strategies."
31972552,"Brain computer interface (BCI) system allows humans to control external devices through motor imagery (MI) signals. However, many existing feature extraction algorithms cannot eliminate the influence of individual differences. This research proposed a new processing algorithm that can reduce the impact of individual differences on classification and improve the universality of the algorithm. To select the optimal frequency band, the energy in each sub-band was calculated by the discrete wavelet transform. Power spectral density and visual geometric group network based convolutional neural network were used for feature extraction and classification respectively. The test of the BCI Competition IV dataset IIa proved the superiority of the algorithm. In comparison with some commonly used methods, the proposed algorithm reduced classification calculation time while improving classification accuracy; the average classification accuracy rate reaches 96.21%, which is far exceeding the results obtained by the latest literature. The good classification performance of this research was rooted in the reduced number of parameters, the reduced consumption of computing resources, and the eliminated influence of individual differences. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can be applied to a real-time multi-class BCI system."
31964514,"Motor Imagery (MI) based Brain-Computer-Interface (BCI) is a rising support system that can assist disabled people to communicate with the real world, without any external help. It serves as an alternative communication channel between the user and computer. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings prove to be an appropriate choice for imaging MI tasks in a BCI system as it provides a non-invasive way for completing the task. The reliability of a BCI system confides on the efficiency of the assessment of different MI tasks. The present work proposes a new approach for the classification of distinct MI tasks based on EEG signals using the flexible analytic wavelet transform (FAWT) technique. The FAWT decomposes the EEG signal into sub-bands and temporal moment-based features are extracted from the sub-bands. Feature normalization is applied to minimize the bias nature of classifier. The FAWT-based features are utilized as inputs to multiple classifiers. Ensemble learning method based Subspace k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) classifier is established as the best and robust classifier for the distinction of the right hand (RH) and right foot (RF) MI tasks. The sub-band (SB) wise features are tested on multiple classifiers and best performance parameters are obtained using the ensemble method based subspace kNN classifier. The best results of parameters are obtained for fourth SB as accuracy 99.33%, sensitivity 99%, specificity 99.6%, F1-Score 0.9925, and kappa value 0.9865. The other sub-bands are also attained significant results using subspace KNN classifier. The proposed work explores the utility of FAWT based features for the classification of RH and RF MI tasks EEG signals. The suggested work highlights the effectiveness of multiple classifiers for classification MI-tasks. The proposed method shows better performance in comparison to state-of-arts methods. Thus, the potential to implement a BCI system for controlling wheelchairs, robotic arms, etc."
31952067,"Numerous studies in the area of BCI are focused on the search for a better experimental paradigm-a set of mental actions that a user can evoke consistently and a machine can discriminate reliably. Examples of such mental activities are motor imagery, mental computations, etc. We propose a technique that instead allows the user to try different mental actions in the search for the ones that will work best. The system is based on a modification of the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm and enables interactive communication between the user and the learning system through a visualization of user's mental state space. During the interaction with the system the user converges on the paradigm that is most efficient and intuitive for that particular user. Results of the two experiments, one allowing muscular activity, another permitting mental activity only, demonstrate soundness of the proposed method and offer preliminary validation of the performance improvement over the traditional closed-loop feedback approach. The proposed method allows a user to visually explore their mental state space in real time, opening new opportunities for scientific inquiry. The application of this method to the area of brain-computer interfaces enables more efficient search for the mental states that will allow a user to reliably control a BCI system."
31947393,"Motor imagery based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) is one of the most common paradigms utilized in neurofeedback training (NFT) for rehabilitation engineering. Specifically, finding an appropriate feedback protocol is significantly important to improve the effectiveness of the motor training system. To this end, we investigated the electroencephalography(EEG) oscillatory patterns measured by event-related desynchronization (ERD) when sixteen participants accepted the visual and proprioceptive stimulation achieving the kinematic hand grasping movements at three different speeds (i.e. 1/3 Hz, 2/3 Hz and 1 Hz). The EEG results indicated that the ERD patterns showed no significant difference in sensorimotor cortex (i.e. C3 and FC3 channels) by comparing the three conditions. Nevertheless, the 2/3 Hz stimulation speed could achieve a significantly better classification performance than the other two conditions across all participants. Therefore, the visual and proprioceptive electrical stimulation achieving the kinematic hand grasping at 2/3 Hz speed might provide an available approach for the online MI-BCI system based NFT system in the future."
31947391,"Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems allow the person in communicating with the external world using Electroencephalography (EEG). Motor Imagery (MI) based BCI systems play a vital role in interacting with the external environment. In this paper, we propose a novel robust feature extraction and classification framework for four class MI classification to improve the classification accuracy. The proposed architecture is developed using log-determinant (log-det) based Regularized Riemannian mean (LDRRM) and linear SVM. The robustness of features extracted from the four class MI data is improved to the outliers and noise by using the proposed LDRRM framework. We evaluated the performance of the proposed LDRRM classification framework on publicly available four class MI dataset 2a of BCI competition IV. The performance results show that the proposed LDRRM classification architecture obtained a mean classification accuracy of 69.12%, also achieved 1.54% higher classification accuracy when compared with the existing studies."
31947390,"This work presents an implementation of Error-related Potential (ErrP) detection to produce progressive adaptation of a motor imagery task classifier. The main contribution is in the evaluation of the effect of vibrotactile feedback on both ErrP and motor imagery detection. Results confirm the potential of self-adaptive techniques to improve motor imagery classification, and support the design of vibratory and in general tactile feedback into Brain-Computer Interfaces to improve both static and adaptive performance."
31947292,"Recently, motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) has been studied as a motor learning method and evaluated by comparing with conventional passive and active training. Most functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) studies adopted block design for comparing those motor learning methods, including MI-BCI. Compared to the block design, event-related design would be more appropriate for estimating cortical activation in MI-BCI which provides feedback for each trial. This paper is a preliminary study to check the feasibility whether event-related design can be applicable for MI-BCI. To this end, three different motor learning methods involving MI-BCI were compared. In hemodynamic response, MI-BCI showed significantly stronger cortical activation than passive training (PT), and weaker than active training (AT), which conforms most existing studies. The results demonstrate that event-related design could be applied to investigate cortical effects of MI-BCI and comparing hemodynamic responses of different motor learning methods."
31947254,"Motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interface systems (BCIs) are highly in demand for many real-time applications such as hands and touch-free text entry, prosthetic arms, virtual reality, movement of wheelchairs, etc. Traditional sparse representation based classification (SRC) is a thriving technique in recent years and has been a successful approach for classifying MI EEG signals. To further improve the capability of SRC, in this paper, a weighted SRC (WSRC) has been proposed for classifying two-class MI tasks (right-hand, right-foot). WSRC constructs a weighted dictionary according to the dissimilarity information between the test data and the training samples. Then for the given test data the sparse coefficients are computed over the weighted dictionary using l<sub>0</sub>-minimization problem. The sparse solution obtained using WSRC gives better discriminative information than SRC and as a consequence, WSRC proves to be superior for MI EEG classification. The experimental results substantiate that WSRC is more efficient and accurate than SRC."
31947251,"A novel decoding scheme for motor imagery (MI) brain computer interfaces (BCI's) is introduced based on the GFT concept. It considers the recorded EEG activity as a signal defined over (the graph of) the sensor array. A graph encapsulating the functional covariations emerging during the execution of a specific imagined movement is first defined, from a small training set of relevant trials. The ensemble of graphs signals corresponding to a multi-trial training dataset is then analyzed using a graph-guided decomposition and, based on discriminative Lasso (dLasso), an information-rich GFT subspace is defined. After training, only simple matrix operations are required for transforming the multichannel signal into features to be fed into a classifier that decides whether brain activity conforms with the graph structure associated with the targeted movement. The proposed decoding scheme is evaluated based on two different datasets and found to compare favorably against popular alternatives in the field."
31947207,"Motor Imagery (MI) is a typical paradigm for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system. In this paper, we propose a new framework by introducing a tensor-based feature representation of the data and also utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for performing classification of MI-EEG signal. The tensor-based representation that includes the structural information in multi-channel time-varying EEG spectrum is generated from tensor discriminant analysis (TDA), and CNN is designed and optimized accordingly for this representation. Compared with CSP+SVM (the conventional framework which is the most successful in MI-based BCI) in the applications to the BCI competition III-IVa dataset, the proposed framework has the following advantages: (1) the most discriminant patterns can be obtained by applying optimum selection of spatial-spectral-temporal subspace for each subject; (2) the corresponding CNN can take full advantage of tensor-based representation and identify discriminative characteristics robustly. The results demonstrate that our framework can further improve classification performance and has great potential for the practical application of BCI."
31947109,"The accuracy of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is important for effective communication and control. The mu-based BCI is one of the widely used systems, of which the related methods to improve users' accuracy is still poorly studied. Here, we examined the way to enhance the mu-based BCI performance by rhythmic electrical stimulation on the ulnar nerve at the contralateral wrist at the alpha frequency (10 Hz) during the left-and right-hand motor imagery. Time-frequency analysis, spectral analysis, and discriminant analysis were performed on the electroencephalograph (EEG) data before and after the intervention of electrical stimulation in 9 healthy subjects. We found that the ERD/S on the somatosensory and motor cortex during left-or right-hand imagination was more obvious at the mu rhythm after intervention. Furthermore, average classification accuracy between left-and right-hand imagery significantly increased from 78.43% to 88.17% after intervention, suggesting that the electrical stimulation at alpha frequency effectively regulates the brain's mu rhythm and enhances the discriminability of the left-hand and right-hand imagination tasks. These results provide evidence that the electrical stimulation at the alpha frequency is an effective way to improve the mu-based BCI performance."
31946875,"In recent years, motor imagery-based BCIs (MI-BCIs) controlled various external devices successfully, which have great potential in neurological rehabilitation. In this paper, we designed a paradigm of sequential finger movements and utilized spatial filters for feature extraction to classify single-trial electroencephalography (EEG) induced by finger movements of left and right hand. Ten healthy subjects participated the experiment. The analysis of EEG patterns showed significant contralateral dominance. We investigated how data length affected the classification accuracy. The classification accuracy was improved with the increase of the keystrokes in one trial, and the results were 87.42%, 91.21%, 93.08% and 93.59% corresponding to single keystroke, two keystrokes, three keystrokes and four keystrokes. This study would be helpful to improve the decoding efficiency and optimize the encoding method of motor-related EEG information."
31946873,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are proposed as a means of communication for locked-in patients. One common BCI paradigm is motor imagery in which the user controls a BCI by imagining movements of different body parts. It is known that imagining different body parts results in event-related desynchronization (ERD) in various frequency bands. Existing methods such as common spatial patterns (CSP) and its refinement filterbank common spatial patterns (FB-CSP) aim at finding features that are informative for classification of the motor imagery class. Our proposed method is a temporally adaptive common spatial patterns implementation of the commonly used filter-bank common spatial patterns method using convolutional neural networks; hence it is called TA-CSPNN. With this method we aim to: (1) make the feature extraction and classification end-to-end, (2) base it on the way CSP/FBCSP extracts relevant features, and finally, (3) reduce the number of trainable parameters compared to existing deep learning methods to improve generalizability in noisy data such as EEG. More importantly, we show that this reduction in parameters does not affect performance and in fact the trained network generalizes better for data from some participants. We show our results on two datasets, one publicly available from BCI Competition IV, dataset 2a and another in-house motor imagery dataset."
31946540,"BCI illiterate subject is defined as the subject who cannot achieve accuracy higher than 70%. BCI illiterate subject cannot produce stronger contralateral ERD/ERS activity, thus most of the frequency band-based algorithms cannot obtain higher accuracy. Deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNN) has revolutionized in many recent studies to learn features and classify different types of data through end-to-end learning. We designed a CNN to extract motor imagery EEG features and then do classification for BCI illiterate subjects in this work. Results showed that the average classification accuracy increased by 18.4% compared with the CSP+LDA algorithm, and the accuracies obtained by CNN exceed 70% for 9 of 11 subjects particularly. CNN requires only a little prior knowledge, thus the features it extracted are not limited in frequency band, but because the poor interpretability of deep learning, we do not know which kind of feature CNN extracted until now. Our future study will focus on visualizing the extracted features to support our conclusions."
31946539,"In this paper, we aim at finding the smallest set of EEG channels that can ensure highly accurate classification of motor imagery (MI) dataset and maintain the optimum Kappa score. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is used for important and discriminant EEG channel selection. Further, the theory of Riemannian geometry in the manifold of covariance matrices is used for feature extraction. At last, the neighborhood component feature selection (NCFS) algorithm is used to select the small subset of important features from the given set of features. The significance of the proposed work is two-fold: 1) it greatly reduces the time complexity and the amount of overfitting by reducing the unnecessary EEG channels and redundant features. 2) it increases the classification accuracy of the model by selecting only subject-specific EEG channels. The proposed algorithm is tested on BCI Competition IV,2a dataset to validate the performance. The proposed approach has achieved 77.91% average classification accuracy and 0.626 mean Kappa score."
31946537,"In recent decades, motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interface (BCI) is served as a control system or rehabilitation tool for motor disabled people. But it has limited applications because of its lower classification performance (classification accuracy, Cohen's kappa coefficient and etc.). The performance depends on the feature extraction techniques and extraction of relevant features from the brain is challenging task. The existing techniques have low classification performance and are computationally inefficient. This paper introduces phase space reconstruction (PSR) to detect various MI activities and improve the performance of the system. First, raw signals were decomposed into multiple frequency sub-bands using filter bank technique. Second, PSR was applied to each sub-band and dynamical behavior of the brain activities has been analyzed. The optimal parameters (time delay and embedding dimension) of PSR were calculated by average mutual information (AMI) and false nearest neighbors (FNN) methods. The time delay and embedding dimension extracted significant features related to MI activities. The significant features were fed into multi-class support vector machine (SVM) and performance of the classifier was evaluated. The performance of the system is based on classification accuracy (%CA) and Cohen's kappa coefficient (K). The proposed algorithm and classifier were tested on BCI competition-2005, MI dataset-III-a. The results show that the proposed technique increases the classification accuracy by 3.7% and achieved higher performance (%CA = 89.20% and K= 0.85)."
31946530,"The reliable classification of Electroencephalography (EEG) signals is a crucial step towards making EEG-controlled non-invasive neuro-exoskeleton rehabilitation a practical reality. EEG signals collected during motor imagery tasks have been proposed to act as a control signal for exoskeleton applications. Here, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) was optimized to classify a two-class kinesthetic motor imagery EEG dataset, leading to an optimized architecture consisting of four convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. Transfer learning, or the leveraging of data from past subjects to classify the intentions of a new subject, is important for rehabilitation as it helps to minimize the number of training sessions required from subjects who lack full motor functionality. The transfer learning training paradigm investigated through this study utilized region criticality trends to reduce the number of new subject training sessions and increase the classification performance when compared against a single-subject non-transfer-learning classifier."
31946529,"Neuroplasticity plays an important role in the recovery of injured nervous system. Both motor imagery (MI) and functional electrical stimulation (FES) can promote plasticity by activating the sensorimotor cortex. Specifically, MI as control strategy to activate FES in a brain computer interface (BCI) is a promising approach for motor functions recovery. This study demonstrated the efficiency of somatosensory input provided by electrical stimulation (ES) on cortical activation during MI. And the performance of classifiers with time-varying electroencephalography (EEG) features also be probed. We inspected the cortical activation by EEG for three experiment conditions, i.e. ES during MI, MI and ES. And the classification accuracy of three conditions were discussed respectively. Results showed that the ES during MI could induce stronger cortical activation than the other two conditions, and the classifier with time-varying EEG features had a higher classification accuracy. The results demonstrated that MI-based BCI combined MI and ES which fulfills two properties of somatosensory input and time-varying features is an available approach for motor neural rehabilitation."
31946010,"At present, in the process of encephalogram motor imagery decoding, facing the background of big data analysis, it has the necessity to design an effective system which is subject-independent. Pre-training is common to carry out before each experiment, which affects the practicability of the EEG system. In order to solve this problem, the most feasible method is to design a unified framework for deep learning optimization, which could capture the spatial and spectral dependence of original motor imagery EEG signals according to the features extracted by CNN and the temporal dependence extracted by RNN-LSTM. The framework is superimposed from both end-to-end and time-frequency domains so as to retain and learn interpretable motor imagery features. In addition, artificial EEG signals can be automatically generated by training the generated adversarial network, which can generate the feature distribution similar to the original EEG signals, increase the capacity of EEG samples, and ultimately improve the classification performance and robustness of EEG motor imagery recognition. This deep learning framework can improve the classification accuracy of motor imagery for different subjects. In addition, the network can learn from the original data with the least amount of preprocessing, thus eliminating the time-consuming data preparation process."

31945930,"Lower-limb exoskeletons have been used in gait rehabilitation to facilitate the restoration of motor skills. These robotics systems could be complemented by Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) to assist or rehabilitate people with walking disabilities. In this preliminary study, electroencephalography-based brain functional connectivity is analyzed during exoskeleton-assisted gait motor imagery (MI) training. Partial Directed Coherence (PDC) analysis was employed to assess the exchange of information flow between EEG signals during gait MI in four healthy subjects, two using an exoskeleton and two without using it. Besides, in order to explore the functional connectivity, an outflow index based on the number of significant directed connectivities revealed by the PDC analysis is proposed. We found that the outflow index increases in the central zone (C2, C3, C4) while decreases in the central-parietal (CP1, CP2) and fronto-central (FC1) zones when the training was assisted by an exoskeleton. The results obtained can be useful to obtain informative features for BCI applications as well as in motor rehabilitation."
31927130,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been largely developed to allow communication, control, and neurofeedback in human beings. Despite their great potential, BCIs perform inconsistently across individuals and the neural processes that enable humans to achieve good control remain poorly understood. To address this question, we performed simultaneous high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings in a motor imagery-based BCI training involving a group of healthy subjects. After reconstructing the signals at the cortical level, we showed that the reinforcement of motor-related activity during the BCI skill acquisition is paralleled by a progressive disconnection of associative areas which were not directly targeted during the experiments. Notably, these network connectivity changes reflected growing automaticity associated with BCI performance and predicted future learning rate. Altogether, our findings provide new insights into the large-scale cortical organizational mechanisms underlying BCI learning, which have implications for the improvement of this technology in a broad range of real-life applications."
31920588,"Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a promising non-invasive method for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). BCIs translate brain activity into signals that allow communication with the outside world. Visual and motor imagery are often used as information-encoding strategies, but can be challenging if not grounded in recent experience in these modalities, e.g., in patients with locked-in-syndrome (LIS). In contrast, somatosensory imagery might constitute a more suitable information-encoding strategy as the somatosensory function is often very robust. Somatosensory imagery has been shown to activate the somatotopic cortex, but it has been unclear so far whether it can be reliably detected on a single-trial level and successfully classified according to specific somatosensory imagery content. Using ultra-high field 7-T fMRI, we show reliable and high-accuracy single-trial decoding of left-foot (LF) vs. right-hand (RH) somatosensory imagery. Correspondingly, higher decoding accuracies were associated with greater spatial separation of hand and foot decoding-weight patterns in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Exploiting these novel neuroscientific insights, we developed-and provide a proof of concept for-basic BCI communication by showing that binary (yes/no) answers encoded by somatosensory imagery can be decoded with high accuracy in simulated real-time (in 7 subjects) as well as in real-time (1 subject). This study demonstrates that body part-specific somatosensory imagery differentially activates somatosensory cortex in a topographically specific manner; evidence which was surprisingly still lacking in the literature. It also offers proof of concept for a novel somatosensory imagery-based fMRI-BCI control strategy, with particularly high potential for visually and motor-impaired patients. The strategy could also be transferred to lower MRI field strengths and to mobile functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Finally, given that communication BCIs provide the BCI user with a form of feedback based on their brain signals and can thus be considered as a specific form of neurofeedback, and that repeated use of a BCI has been shown to enhance underlying representations, we expect that the current BCI could also offer an interesting new approach for somatosensory rehabilitation training in the context of stroke and phantom limb pain."
31918621,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) decode user's intentions to control external devices. However, performance variations across individuals have limited their use to laboratory environments. Handedness could contribute to these variations, especially when motor imagery (MI) tasks are used for BCI control. To further understand how handedness affects BCI control, performance differences between two monozygotic twins were analysed during offline movement and MI tasks, and while twins controlled a BCI using right-hand MI. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG), brain structures' volumes, and neuropsychological tests were assessed to evaluate physiological, anatomical and psychological relationships with BCI performance. Results showed that both twins had good motor imagery and attention abilities, similar volumes on most subcortical brain structures, more pronounced event-related desynchronization elicited by the twin performing non-dominant MI, and that this twin also obtained significant higher performances with the BCI. Linear regression analysis implied a strong association between twins' BCI performance, and more pronounced cortical activations in the contralateral hemisphere relative to hand MI. Therefore, it is possible that BCI performance was related with the ability of each twin to elicit cortical activations during hand MI, and less associated with subcortical brain structures' volumes and neuropsychological tests."
33747669,"Discovering and exploiting shared, invariant neural activity in electroencephalogram (EEG) based classification tasks is of significant interest for generalizability of decoding models across subjects or EEG recording sessions. While deep neural networks are recently emerging as generic EEG feature extractors, this transfer learning aspect usually relies on the prior assumption that deep networks naturally behave as subject- (or session-) invariant EEG feature extractors. We propose a further step towards invariance of EEG deep learning frameworks in a systemic way during model training. We introduce an adversarial inference approach to learn representations that are invariant to inter-subject variabilities within a discriminative setting. We perform experimental studies using a publicly available motor imagery EEG dataset, and state-of-the-art convolutional neural network based EEG decoding models within the proposed adversarial learning framework. We present our results in cross-subject model transfer scenarios, demonstrate neurophysiological interpretations of the learned networks, and discuss potential insights offered by adversarial inference to the growing field of deep learning for EEG."
31887332,"Motor recovery of wrist and fingers is still a great challenge for chronic stroke survivors. The present study aimed to verify the efficiency of motor imagery based brain-computer interface (BCI) control of continuous passive motion (CPM) in the recovery of wrist extension due to stroke. An observational study was conducted in 26 chronic stroke patients, aged 49.0 ± 15.4 years, with upper extremity motor impairment. All patients showed no wrist extension recovery. A 24-channel highresolution electroencephalogram (EEG) system was used to acquire cortical signal while they were imagining extension of the affected wrist. Then, 20 sessions of BCI-driven CPM training were carried out for 6 weeks. Primary outcome was the increase of active range of motion (ROM) of the affected wrist from the baseline to final evaluation. Improvement of modified Barthel Index, EEG classification and motor imagery pattern of wrist extension were recorded as secondary outcomes. Twenty-one patients finally passed the EEG screening and completed all the BCI-driven CPM trainings. From baseline to the final evaluation, the increase of active ROM of the affected wrists was (24.05 ± 14.46)˚. The increase of modified Barthel Index was 3.10 ± 4.02 points. But no statistical difference was detected between the baseline and final evaluations (P > 0.05). Both EEG classification and motor imagery pattern improved. The present study demonstrated beneficial outcomes of MI-based BCI control of CPM training in motor recovery of wrist extension using motor imagery signal of brain in chronic stroke patients."
31885534,"In this paper, we evaluate a semiautonomous brain-computer interface (BCI) for manipulation tasks. In such a system, the user controls a robotic arm through motor imagery commands. In traditional process-control BCI systems, the user has to provide those commands continuously in order to manipulate the effector of the robot step-by-step, which results in a tiresome process for simple tasks such as pick and replace an item from a surface. Here, we take a semiautonomous approach based on a conformal geometric algebra model that solves the inverse kinematics of the robot on the fly, and then the user only has to decide on the start of the movement and the final position of the effector (goal-selection approach). Under these conditions, we implemented pick-and-place tasks with a disk as an item and two target areas placed on the table at arbitrary positions. An artificial vision (AV) algorithm was used to obtain the positions of the items expressed in the robot frame through images captured with a webcam. Then, the AV algorithm is integrated into the inverse kinematics model to perform the manipulation tasks. As proof-of-concept, different users were trained to control the pick-and-place tasks through the process-control and semiautonomous goal-selection approaches so that the performance of both schemes could be compared. Our results show the superiority in performance of the semiautonomous approach as well as evidence of less mental fatigue with it."
31885530,"Long and tedious calibration time hinders the development of motor imagery- (MI-) based brain-computer interface (BCI). To tackle this problem, we use a limited labelled set and a relatively large unlabelled set from the same subject for training based on the transductive support vector machine (TSVM) framework. We first introduce an improved TSVM (ITSVM) method, in which a comprehensive feature of each sample consists of its common spatial patterns (CSP) feature and its geometric feature. Moreover, we use the concave-convex procedure (CCCP) to solve the optimization problem of TSVM under a new balancing constraint that can address the unknown distribution of the unlabelled set by considering various possible distributions. In addition, we propose an improved self-training TSVM (IST-TSVM) method that can iteratively perform CSP feature extraction and ITSVM classification using an expanded labelled set. Extensive experimental results on dataset IV-a from BCI competition III and dataset II-a from BCI competition IV show that our algorithms outperform the other competing algorithms, where the sizes and distributions of the labelled sets are variable. In particular, IST-TSVM provides average accuracies of 63.25% and 69.43% with the abovementioned two datasets, respectively, where only four positive labelled samples and sixteen negative labelled samples are used. Therefore, our algorithms can provide an alternative way to reduce the calibration time."
31875363,"This paper aims to realize the decoding of single trial motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) signal by extracting and classifying the optimized features of EEG signal. In the classification and recognition of multi-channel EEG signals, there is often a lack of effective feature selection strategies in the selection of the data of each channel and the dimension of spatial filters. In view of this problem, a method combining sparse idea and greedy search (GS) was proposed to improve the feature extraction of common spatial pattern (CSP). The improved common spatial pattern could effectively overcome the problem of repeated selection of feature patterns in the feature vector space extracted by the traditional method, and make the extracted features have more obvious characteristic differences. Then the extracted features were classified by Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA). The experimental results showed that the classification accuracy obtained by proposed method was 19% higher on average than that of traditional common spatial pattern. And high classification accuracy could be obtained by selecting feature set with small size. The research results obtained in the feature extraction of EEG signals lay the foundation for the realization of motor imagery EEG decoding."
31870987,"This paper presents a new asynchronous hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) system that integrates a speller, a web browser, an e-mail client, and a file explorer using electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals. More specifically, an EOG-based button selection method, which requires the user to blink his/her eyes synchronously with the target button's flashes during button selection, is first presented. Next, we propose a mouse control method by combining EEG and EOG signals, in which the left-/right-hand motor imagery (MI)-related EEG is used to control the horizontal movement of the mouse and the blink-related EOG is used to control the vertical movement of the mouse and to select/reject a target. These two methods are further combined to develop the integrated hybrid BCI system. With the hybrid BCI, users can input text, access the internet, communicate with others via e-mail, and manage files in their computer using only EEG and EOG without any body movements. Ten healthy subjects participated in a comprehensive online experiment, and superior performance was achieved compared with our previously developed P300- and MI-based BCI and some other asynchronous BCIs, therefore demonstrating the system's effectiveness."
31863249,"Nowadays, motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been developed rapidly. In these systems, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are recorded when a subject is involved in the imagination of doing any motor imagery movement like the imagination of the right/left hands, etc. In this paper, we sought to validate and enhance our previously proposed angle-amplitude transformation (AAT) technique, which is a simple signal-to-image transformation approach for the classification of EEG and MEG signals. For this purpose, we diversified our previous method and proposed four new angle-amplitude graph (AAG) representation methods for AAT transformation. These modifications were made on some points such as using different left/right side changing points at a different distance. To confirm the validity of the proposed methods, we performed experiments on the BCI Competition III Dataset IIIa, which is a benchmark dataset widely used for EEG-based multi-class motor imagery tasks. The procedure of proposed methods can be summarized in a concise manner as follows: (i) convert EEG signals to AAG images by using the proposed AAT transformation approaches; (ii) extract image features by employing Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)-based Bag of Visual Word (BoW); and (iii) classify features with k-Nearest Neighbor (k NN) algorithm. Experimental results showed that the changes in the baseline AAT approaches enhanced the classification performance on Dataset IIIa with an accuracy of 96.50% for two-class problem (left/right hand movement imaginations) and 97.99% for four-class problem (left/right hand, foot and tongue movement imaginations). These achievements are mainly due to the help of effective enhancements on AAG image representations. Graphical Abstract The flow diagram of the proposed methodology."
31860902,"Common spatial patterns (CSP) is a prominent feature extraction algorithm in motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, CSP is computed using sample-based covariance-matrix estimation. Hence, its performance deteriorates if the number of training trials is small. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel regularized covariance matrix estimation framework for CSP (i.e. DTW-RCSP) based on dynamic time warping (DTW) and transfer learning. The proposed framework combines the subject-specific covariance matrix ([Formula: see text]) estimated using the available trials from the new subject, with a novel DTW-based transferred covariance matrix ([Formula: see text]) estimated using previous subjects' trials. In the proposed [Formula: see text], the available labelled trials from the previous subjects are temporally aligned to the average of the available trials of the new subject from the same class using DTW. This alignment aims to reduce temporal variations and non-stationarities between previous subjects' trials and the available trials from the new subjects. Moreover, to tackle the problem of regularization parameter selection when only a few trials are available for training, an online method is proposed, where the best regularization parameter is selected based on the confidence scores of the trained classifier on the upcoming first few labelled testing trials. The proposed framework is evaluated on two datasets against two baseline algorithms. The obtained results reveal that DTW-RCSP significantly outperformed the baseline algorithms at various testing scenarios, particularly, when only a few trials are available for training. Impressively, our results show that successful BCI interactions could be achieved with a calibration session as small as only one trial per class."
31849587,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in motor imagery (MI) have developed rapidly in recent years. A reliable feature extraction method is essential because of a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and time-dependent covariates of EEG signals. Because of efficient application in various fields, deep learning has been adopted in EEG signal processing and has obtained competitive results compared with the traditional methods. However, designing and training an end-to-end network to fully extract potential features from EEG signals remains a challenge in MI. In this study, we propose a parallel multiscale filter bank convolutional neural network (MSFBCNN) for MI classification. We introduce a layered end-to-end network structure, in which a feature-extraction network is used to extract temporal and spatial features. To enhance the transfer learning ability, we propose a network initialization and fine-tuning strategy to train an individual model for inter-subject classification on small datasets. We compare our MSFBCNN with the state-of-the-art approaches on open datasets. The proposed method has a higher accuracy than the baselines in intra-subject classification. In addition, the transfer learning experiments indicate that our network can build an individual model and obtain acceptable results in inter-subject classification. The results suggest that the proposed network has superior performance, robustness, and transfer learning ability."
31847114,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology used to convert brain signals to control external devices. Researchers have designed and built many interfaces and applications in the last couple of decades. BCI is used for prevention, detection, diagnosis, rehabilitation, and restoration in healthcare. EEG signals are analyzed in this paper to help paralyzed people in rehabilitation. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded from five healthy subjects are used in this study. The sensor level EEG signals are converted to source signals using the inverse problem solution. Then, the cortical sources are calculated using sLORETA methods at nine regions marked by a neurophysiologist. The features are extracted from cortical sources by using the common spatial pattern (CSP) method and classified by a support vector machine (SVM). Both the sensor and the computed cortical signals corresponding to motor imagery of the hand and foot are used to train the SVM algorithm. Then, the signals outside the training set are used to test the classification performance of the classifier. The 0.1-30 Hz and mu rhythm band-pass filtered activity is also analyzed for the EEG signals. The classification performance and recognition of the imagery improved up to 100% under some conditions for the cortical level. The cortical source signals at the regions contributing to motor commands are investigated and used to improve the classification of motor imagery."
31824245,"Most existing brain-computer Interfaces (BCIs) are designed to control a single assistive device, such as a wheelchair, a robotic arm or a prosthetic limb. However, many daily tasks require combined functions which can only be realized by integrating multiple robotic devices. Such integration raises the requirement of the control accuracy and is more challenging to achieve a reliable control compared with the single device case. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid BCI with high accuracy based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) to control an integrated wheelchair robotic arm system. The user turns the wheelchair left/right by performing left/right hand motor imagery (MI), and generates other commands for the wheelchair and the robotic arm by performing eye blinks and eyebrow raising movements. Twenty-two subjects participated in a MI training session and five of them completed a mobile self-drinking experiment, which was designed purposely with high accuracy requirements. The results demonstrated that the proposed hBCI could provide satisfied control accuracy for a system that consists of multiple robotic devices, and showed the potential of BCI-controlled systems to be applied in complex daily tasks."
31813489,"As new human-computer interaction technology, brain-computer interface has been widely used in various fields of life. The study of EEG signals cannot only improve people's awareness of the brain, but also establish new ways for the brain to communicate with the outside world. This paper takes the motion imaging EEG signal as the research object and proposes an innovative semi-supervised model called KNN-based smooth auto-encoder (k-SAE). K-SAE looks for the nearest neighbor values of the samples to construct a new input and learns the robust features representation by reconstructing this new input instead of the original input, which is different from the traditional automatic encoder (AE). The Gaussian filter is selected as the convolution kernel function in k-SAE to smooth the noise in the feature. Besides, the data information and spatial position of the feature map are recorded by max-pooling and unpooling, that help to prevent loss of important information. The method is applied to two data sets for feature extraction and classification experiments of motor imaging EEG signals. The experimental results show that k-SAE achieves good recognition accuracy and outperforms other state-of-the-art recognition algorithms."
33438596,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems typically deploy common spatial pattern (CSP) for feature extraction of mu and beta rhythms based on upper-limbs kinaesthetic motor imageries (KMI). However, it was not used to classify the left versus right foot KMI, due to its location inside the mesial wall of sensorimotor cortex, which makes it difficult to be detected. We report novel classification of mu and beta EEG features, during left and right foot KMI cognitive task, using CSP, and filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) method, to optimize the subject-specific band selection. We initially proposed CSP method, followed by the implementation of FBCSP for optimization of individual spatial patterns, wherein a set of CSP filters was learned, for each of the time/frequency filters in a supervised way. This was followed by the log-variance feature extraction and concatenation of all features (over all chosen spectral-filters). Subsequently, supervised machine learning was implemented, i.e. logistic regression (Logreg) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), in order to compare the respective foot KMI classification rates. Training and testing data, used in the model, was validated using 10-fold cross validation. Four methodology paradigms are reported, i.e. CSP LDA, CSP Logreg, and FBCSP LDA, FBCSP Logreg. All paradigms resulted in an average classification accuracy rate above the statistical chance level of 60.0% (P < 0.01). On average, FBCSP LDA outperformed remaining paradigms with kappa score of 0.41 and classification accuracy of 70.28% ± 4.23. Similarly, this paradigm enabled discrimination between right and left foot KMI cognitive task at highest accuracy rate i.e. maximum 77.5% with kappa = 0.55 and the area under ROC curve as 0.70 (in single-trial analysis). The proposed novel paradigms, using CSP and FBCSP, established a potential to exploit the left versus right foot imagery classification, in synchronous 2-class BCI for controlling robotic foot, or foot neuroprosthesis."
31747655,"The ability to decode kinematics of imagined movement from neural activity is essential for the development of prosthetic devices that can aid motor-disabled persons. To date, non-invasive recording methods, including electroencephalogram (EEG) were used to decode actual and imagined hand trajectory to control neuromotor prostheses, commonly by applying multi-dimensional linear regression (mLR) models to adjust the two temporal signals-neural signal and limb kinematics. It is still debated, however, whether the EEG signal, in general, and slow cortical potentials (SCPs), in specific, hold motor neural correlates. Moreover, it has not yet been tested whether the trajectory of proximal arm joints, i.e. shoulder, can also be reconstructed and if decoding performance is dependent on movement speed and/or position variance. We predicted hand, elbow and shoulder trajectories in 3D space in time series of both movement types (actual and imagined) of seven subjects using an mLR model, commonly applied for motion trajectory prediction (MTP) and used source localization to detect and compare between brain areas activated during actual and imagined movements for each arm joint. For all arm joints and movement types, SCPs contributed the most to trajectory reconstruction, and decoding accuracy peaked using neural signals preceding kinematics by 120-210 ms. The average (across subjects) Pearson's correlation coefficient between predicted and actual trajectories ranged 0.24-0.49, 0.41-0.48 and 0.18-0.40 for the hand, elbow and shoulder, respectively, and was significantly higher than chance level (p   <  0.01) for all subjects. For the imagined movements, reconstruction accuracy ranged between 0.09-0.23, 0.20-0.27 and 0.11-0.18 for the hand, elbow and shoulder, respectively, and was significantly higher than chance level (p   <  0.05) for all or some of the arm joints. The model performance was positively correlated with movement speed and negatively correlated with position variance. Source localization suggested that the neural circuits engaged in motor imagery are more diffuse and bilateral; motor imagery was, when compared to movement execution, more associated with recruiting premotor regions and a large area of the left parietal cortex. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting 3D imagined trajectories of all arm joints from scalp EEG and imply the existence of movement related neural correlates in slow cortical potentials."
31726440,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are becoming important tools for assistive technology, particularly through the use of motor imagery (MI) for aiding task completion. However, most existing methods of MI classification have been applied in a trial-wise fashion, with window sizes of approximately 2 s or more. Application of this type of classifier could cause a delay when switching between MI events. In this study, state-of-the-art classification methods for motor imagery are assessed offline with considerations for real-time and self-paced control, and a convolutional long-short term memory (C-LSTM) network based on filter bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP) is proposed. In addition, the effects of several methods of data augmentation on different classifiers are explored. The results of this study show that the proposed network achieves adequate results in distinguishing between different control classes, but both considered deep learning models are still less reliable than a Riemannian MDM classifier. In addition, controlled skewing of the data and the explored data augmentation methods improved the average overall accuracy of the classifiers by 14.0% and 5.3%, respectively. This manuscript is among the first to attempt combining convolutional and recurrent neural network layers for the purpose of MI classification, and is also one of the first to provide an in-depth comparison of various data augmentation methods for MI classification. In addition, all of these methods are applied on smaller windows of data and with consideration to ambient data, which provides a more realistic test bed for real-time and self-paced control."
31725394,"For a brain-computer interface (BCI) system, a calibration procedure is required for each individual user before he/she can use the BCI. This procedure requires approximately 20-30 min to collect enough data to build a reliable decoder. It is, therefore, an interesting topic to build a calibration-free, or subject-independent, BCI. In this article, we construct a large motor imagery (MI)-based electroencephalography (EEG) database and propose a subject-independent framework based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The database is composed of 54 subjects performing the left- and right-hand MI on two different days, resulting in 21 600 trials for the MI task. In our framework, we formulated the discriminative feature representation as a combination of the spectral-spatial input embedding the diversity of the EEG signals, as well as a feature representation learned from the CNN through a fusion technique that integrates a variety of discriminative brain signal patterns. To generate spectral-spatial inputs, we first consider the discriminative frequency bands in an information-theoretic observation model that measures the power of the features in two classes. From discriminative frequency bands, spectral-spatial inputs that include the unique characteristics of brain signal patterns are generated and then transformed into a covariance matrix as the input to the CNN. In the process of feature representations, spectral-spatial inputs are individually trained through the CNN and then combined by a concatenation fusion technique. In this article, we demonstrate that the classification accuracy of our subject-independent (or calibration-free) model outperforms that of subject-dependent models using various methods [common spatial pattern (CSP), common spatiospectral pattern (CSSP), filter bank CSP (FBCSP), and Bayesian spatio-spectral filter optimization (BSSFO)]."
31725383,"Motor imagery (MI) is an important brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm, which can be applied without external stimulus. Imagining different joint movements from the same limb allows intuitive control of the outer devices. However, few researches focused on this field, and the decoding accuracy limited the applications for practical use. In this study, we aim to use deep learning methods to explore the ceiling of the decoding performance of three tasks: the resting state, the MI of right hand and right elbow. To represent the brain functional relationships, the correlation matrix that consists of correlation coefficients between electrodes (channels) was calculated as features. We proposed the Channel-Correlation Network to learn the overall representation among channels for classification. Ensemble learning was applied to integrate the output of multiple Channel-Correlation Networks. Our proposed method achieved the decoding accuracy of up to 87.03% in the 3-class scenario. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning method for decoding MI of different joints from the same limb and the potential of this fine paradigm to be applied in practice."
31711330,"The performance of a brain-computer interface (BCI) will generally improve by increasing the volume of training data on which it is trained. However, a classifier's generalization ability is often negatively affected when highly non-stationary data are collected across both sessions and subjects. The aim of this work is to reduce the long calibration time in BCI systems by proposing a transfer learning model which can be used for evaluating unseen single trials for a subject without the need for training session data. A method is proposed which combines a generalization of the previously proposed subject-specific ""multivariate empirical-mode decomposition"" preprocessing technique by taking a fixed band of 8-30<math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mspace></mspace></math>Hz for all four motor imagery tasks and a novel classification model which exploits the structure of tangent space features drawn from the Riemannian geometry framework, that is shared among the training data of multiple sessions and subjects.

31696938,"Two groups of inexperienced brain-computer interface users underwent a purely mental EEG-BCI session that rapidly impacted on their brain. Modulations in structural and functional MRI were found after only 1 h of BCI training. Two different types of BCI (based on motor imagery or visually evoked potentials) were employed and analyses showed that the brain plastic changes are spatially specific for the respective neurofeedback. This spatial specificity promises tailored therapeutic interventions (e.g. for stroke patients). A brain-computer-interface (BCI) allows humans to control computational devices using only neural signals. However, it is still an open question, whether performing BCI also impacts on the brain itself, i.e. whether brain plasticity is induced. Here, we show rapid and spatially specific signs of brain plasticity measured with functional and structural MRI after only 1 h of purely mental BCI training in BCI-naive subjects. We employed two BCI approaches with neurofeedback based on (i) modulations of EEG rhythms by motor imagery (MI-BCI) or (ii) event-related potentials elicited by visually targeting flashing letters (ERP-BCI). Before and after the BCI session we performed structural and functional MRI. For both BCI approaches we found increased T1-weighted MR signal in the grey matter of the respective target brain regions, such as occipital/parietal areas after ERP-BCI and precuneus and sensorimotor regions after MI-BCI. The latter also showed increased functional connectivity and higher task-evoked BOLD activity in the same areas. Our results demonstrate for the first time that BCI by means of targeted neurofeedback rapidly impacts on MRI measures of brain structure and function. The spatial specificity of BCI-induced brain plasticity promises therapeutic interventions tailored to individual functional deficits, for example in patients after stroke."
31693928,"Motor imagery (MI) is a commonly used cognitive task in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications because it produces reliable activity in motor-planning regions. However, a number of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) studies have reported the unexpected finding of inverse oxygenation: increased deoxyhemoglobin and decreased oxyhemoglobin during task periods. This finding questions the reliability of fNIRS for BCI applications given that MI activation should result in a focal increase in blood oxygenation. In an attempt to elucidate this phenomenon, fMRI and fNIRS data were acquired on 15 healthy participants performing a MI task. The fMRI data provided global coverage of brain activity, thus allowing visualization of all potential brain regions activated and deactivated during task periods. Indeed, fMRI results from seven subjects included activation in the primary motor cortex and/or the pre-supplementary motor area during the rest periods in addition to the expected activation in the supplementary motor and premotor areas. Of these seven subjects, two showed inverse oxygenation with fNIRS. The proximity of the regions showing inverse oxygenation to the motor planning regions suggests that inverse activation detected by fNIRS may likely be a consequence of partial volume errors due to the sensitivity of the optodes to both primary motor and motor planning regions."
31687005,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) decodes the brain signals representing a desire to do something and transforms those signals into a control command. However, only a limited number of mental tasks have been previously investigated and classified. This study aimed to investigate two motor imagery (MI) commands, moving forward and moving backward, using a small number of EEG channels, to be used in a neurofeedback context. This study also aimed to simulate a BCI and investigate the offline classification between MI movements in forward and backward directions, using different features and classification methods. Ten healthy people participated in a two-session (48 min each) experiment. This experiment investigated neurofeedback of navigation in a virtual tunnel. Each session consisted of 320 trials where subjects were asked to imagine themselves moving in the tunnel in a forward or backward motion after a randomly presented (forward versus backward) command on the screen. Three electrodes were mounted bilaterally over the motor cortex. Trials were conducted with feedback. Data from session 1 were analyzed offline to train classifiers and to calculate thresholds for both tasks. These thresholds were used to form control signals that were later used online in session 2 in neurofeedback training to trigger the virtual tunnel to move in the direction requested by the user's brain signals. After 96 min of training, the online band-power neurofeedback training achieved an average classification of 76%, while the offline BCI simulation using power spectral density asymmetrical ratio and AR-modeled band power as features, and using LDA and SVM as classifiers, achieved an average classification of 80%."
31683268,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are non-stationary. This could be due to internal fluctuation of brain states such as fatigue, frustration, etc. This necessitates the development of adaptive brain-computer interfaces (BCI) whose performance does not deteriorate significantly with the adversary change in the cognitive state. In this paper, we put forward an unsupervised adaptive scheme to adapt the feature extractor of motor imagery (MI) BCIs by tracking the fatigue level of the user. Eleven subjects participated in the study during which they accomplished MI tasks while self-reporting their perceived levels of mental fatigue. Out of the 11 subjects, only six completed the whole experiment, while the others quit in the middle because of experiencing high fatigue. The adaptive feature extractor is attained through the adaptation of the common spatial patterns (CSP), one of the most popular feature extraction algorithms in EEG-based BCIs. The proposed method was analyzed in two ways: offline and in near real-time. The separability of the MI EEG features extracted by the proposed adaptive CSP (ADCSP) has been compared with that by the conventional CSP (C-CSP) and another CSP based adaptive method (ACSP) in terms of: Davies Bouldin index (DBI), Fisher score (FS) and Dunn's index (DI). Experimental results show significant improvement in the separability of MI EEG features extracted by ADCSP as compared to that by C-CSP and ACSP. Collectively, the results of the experiments in this study suggest that adapting CSP based on mental fatigue can improve the class separability of MI EEG features."
31680914,"Motor imagery (MI) based brain computer interfaces (BCI) detect changes in brain activity associated with imaginary limb movements, and translate them into device commands. MI based BCIs require training, during which the user gradually learns how to control his or her brain activity with the help of feedback. Additionally, machine learning techniques are frequently used to boost BCI performance and to adapt the decoding algorithm to the user's brain. Thus, both the brain and the machine need to adapt in order to improve performance. To study the utility of co-adaptive training in the BCI paradigm and the time scales involved, we investigated the performance of two groups of subjects, in a 4-day MI experiment using EEG recordings. One group (control, <i>n</i> = 9 subjects) performed the BCI task using a fixed classifier based on MI data from day 1. In the second group (experimental, <i>n</i> = 9 subjects), the classifier was regularly adapted based on brain activity patterns during the experiment days. We found that the experimental group showed a significantly larger change in performance following training compared to the control group. Specifically, although the experimental group exhibited a decrease in performance between days, it showed an increase in performance within each day, which compensated for the decrease. The control group showed decreases both within and between days. A correlation analysis in subjects who had a notable improvement in performance following training showed that performance was mainly associated with modulation of power in the α frequency band. To conclude, continuous updating of the classification algorithm improves the performance of subjects in longitudinal BCI training."
31677441,"Motivated by the recent progress of Spiking Neural Network (SNN) models in pattern recognition, we report on the development and evaluation of brain signal classifiers based on SNNs. The work shows the capabilities of this type of Spiking Neurons in the recognition of motor imagery tasks from EEG signals and compares their performance with other traditional classifiers commonly used in this application. This work includes two stages: the first stage consists of comparing the performance of the SNN models against some traditional neural network models. The second stage, compares the SNN models performance in two input conditions: input features with constant values and input features with temporal information. The EEG signals employed in this work represent five motor imagery tasks: i.e. rest, left hand, right hand, foot and tongue movements. These EEG signals were obtained from a public database provided by the Technological University of Graz (Brunner et al., 2008). The feature extraction stage was performed by applying two algorithms: power spectral density and wavelet decomposition. Likewise, this work uses raw EEG signals for the second stage of the problem solution. All of the models were evaluated in the classification between two motor imagery tasks. This work demonstrates that with a smaller number of Spiking neurons, simple problems can be solved. Better results are obtained by using patterns with temporal information, thereby exploiting the capabilities of the SNNs."
31662834,"Motor imagery is one of the classical paradigms which have been used in brain-computer interface and motor function recovery. Finger movement-based motor execution is a complex biomechanical architecture and a crucial task for establishing most complicated and natural activities in daily life. Some patients may suffer from alternating hemiplegia after brain stroke and lose their ability of motor execution. Fortunately, the ability of motor imagery might be preserved independently and worked as a backdoor for motor function recovery. The efficacy of motor imagery for achieving significant recovery for the motor cortex after brain stroke is still an open question. In this study, we designed a new paradigm to investigate the neural mechanism of thirty finger movements in two scenarios: motor execution and motor imagery. Eleven healthy participants performed or imagined thirty hand gestures twice based on left and right finger movements. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signal for each subject during sixty trials left and right finger motor execution and imagery were recorded during our proposed experimental paradigm. The Granger causality (G-causality) analysis method was employed to analyze the brain connectivity and its strength between contralateral premotor, motor, and sensorimotor areas. Highest numbers for G-causality trials of 37 ± 7.3, 35.5 ± 8.8, 36.3 ± 10.3, and 39.2 ± 9.0 and lowest Granger causality coefficients of 9.1 ± 3.2, 10.9 ± 3.7, 13.2 ± 0.6, and 13.4 ± 0.6 were achieved from the premotor to motor area during execution/imagination tasks of right and left finger movements, respectively. These results provided a new insight into motor execution and motor imagery based on hand gestures, which might be useful to build a new biomarker of finger motor recovery for partially or even completely plegic patients. Furthermore, a significant difference of the G-causality trial number was observed during left finger execution/imagery and right finger imagery, but it was not observed during the right finger execution phase. Significant difference of the G-causality coefficient was observed during left finger execution and imagery, but it was not observed during right finger execution and imagery phases. These results suggested that different MI-based brain motor function recovery strategies should be taken for right-hand and left-hand patients after brain stroke."
31647122,"Embodiment of a virtual body was induced and its movements were controlled by two different brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigms - one based on signals from sensorimotor versus one from visual cortical areas. BCI-control of movements engenders agency, but not equally for all paradigms. Cortical sensorimotor activation correlates with agency and responsibility. This has significant implications for neurological rehabilitation and neuroethics. Agency is the attribution of an action to the self and is a prerequisite for experiencing responsibility over its consequences. Here we investigated agency and responsibility by studying the control of movements of an embodied avatar, via brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, in immersive virtual reality. After induction of virtual body ownership by visuomotor correlations, healthy participants performed a motor task with their virtual body. We compared the passive observation of the subject's 'own' virtual arm performing the task with (1) the control of the movement through activation of sensorimotor areas (motor imagery) and (2) the control of the movement through activation of visual areas (steady-state visually evoked potentials). The latter two conditions were carried out using a BCI and both shared the intention and the resulting action. We found that BCI-control of movements engenders the sense of agency, which is strongest for sensorimotor area activation. Furthermore, increased activity of sensorimotor areas, as measured using EEG, correlates with levels of agency and responsibility. We discuss the implications of these results for the neural basis of agency."
31635424,"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) are systems that allow the interaction of people and devices on the grounds of brain activity. The noninvasive and most viable way to obtain such information is by using electroencephalography (EEG). However, these signals have a low signal-to-noise ratio, as well as a low spatial resolution. This work proposes a new method built from the combination of a Blind Source Separation (BSS) to obtain estimated independent components, a 2D representation of these component signals using the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), and a classification stage using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach. A criterion based on the spectral correlation with a Movement Related Independent Component (MRIC) is used to sort the estimated sources by BSS, thus reducing the spatial variance. The experimental results of 94.66% using a k-fold cross validation are competitive with techniques recently reported in the state-of-the-art."
31616269,"This paper presents a gamified motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) training in immersive virtual reality. The aim of the proposed training method is to increase engagement, attention, and motivation in co-adaptive event-driven MI-BCI training. This was achieved using gamification, progressive increase of the training pace, and virtual reality design reinforcing body ownership transfer (embodiment) into the avatar. From the 20 healthy participants performing 6 runs of 2-class MI-BCI training (left/right hand), 19 were trained for a basic level of MI-BCI operation, with average peak accuracy in the session = 75.84%. This confirms the proposed training method succeeded in improvement of the MI-BCI skills; moreover, participants were leaving the session in high positive affect. Although the performance was not directly correlated to the degree of embodiment, subjective magnitude of the body ownership transfer illusion correlated with the ability to modulate the sensorimotor rhythm."
31614343,"This study aims to propose and validate a subject-specific approach to recognize two different cognitive neural states (relax and pedaling motor imagery (MI)) by selecting the relevant electroencephalogram (EEG) channels. The main aims of the proposed work are: (i) to reduce the computational complexity of the BCI systems during MI detection by selecting the relevant EEG channels, (ii) to reduce the amount of data overfitting that may arise due to unnecessary channels and redundant features, and (iii) to reduce the classification time for real-time BCI applications. The proposed method selects subject-specific EEG channels and features based on their MI. In this work, we make use of non-negative matrix factorization to extract the weight of the EEG channels based on their contribution to MI detection. Further, the neighborhood component analysis is used for subject-specific feature selection. We executed the experiments using EEG signals recorded for MI where ten healthy subjects performed MI movement of the lower limb to generate motor commands. An average accuracy of 96.66%, average true positive rate (TPR) of 97.77%, average false positives rate of 4.44%, and average Kappa of 93.33% were obtained. The proposed subject-specific EEG channel selection based MI recognition system provides 13.20% improvement in detection accuracy, and 27% improvement in Kappa value with less number of EEG channels compared to the results obtained using all EEG channels. The proposed subject-specific BCI system has been found significantly advantageous compared to the typical approach of using a fixed channel configuration. This work shows that fewer EEG channels not only reduce computational complexity and processing time (two times faster) but also improve the MI detection performance. The proposed method selects EEG locations related to the foot movement, which may be relevant for neuro-rehabilitation using lower-limb movements that may provide a real-time and more natural interface between patient and robotic device."
31614183,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that translates neural activity into a practical output. Its functionality, therefore, depends not only on the computer itself, but also on the cognitive system of the user. Distractors have the potential to capture attention, increase cognitive load, and may therefore impact BCI use. The purpose of the current study is to determine the effects of small visual distractors on the cognitive load of users of a motor imagery-BCI, and to examine whether these distractor-mediated effects can be improved by modifying the task interface. Sixteen typically-developed participants completed two sessions of online motor imagery to control an EEG-BCI, under conditions of no distractors, visual distractors, and cognitive strategies (intended to mitigate cognitive load) amid distractors. Cognitive load for each session was assessed through both a ratio of theta to alpha power and the NASA-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). Task-irrelevant visual stimuli were found to significantly increase the objective measure of cognitive load, particularly for parietal channels. Subjective cognitive load as indexed by the NASA-TLX was predictive of a decrease in BCI performance for participants with below 0.75 classification accuracy (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.32, p < 0.001), which may indicate a differential susceptibility to changes in workload for ""low""-performing participants. Quantifying and addressing the increased cognitive load imparted by distractors on BCI users can aid in the future applicability of the technology in real-world settings."
31597125,"Studies of the neuropathological effects of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) on the underlying motor system have investigated abnormalities in the magnitude and timing of the event-related desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS) during motor execution (ME). However, the spatio-spectral-temporal dynamics of these sensorimotor oscillations during motor imagery (MI) have not been fully explored for these patients. This study explores the neural dynamics of sensorimotor oscillations for ALS patients during MI by quantifying ERD/ERS features in frequency, time, and space. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded from six patients with ALS and 11 age-matched healthy controls (HC) while performing a MI task. ERD/ERS features were extracted using wavelet-based time-frequency analysis and compared between the two groups to quantify the abnormal neural dynamics of ALS in terms of both time and frequency. Topographic correlation analysis was conducted to compare the localization of MI activity between groups and to identify subject-specific frequencies in the µ and β frequency bands. Overall, reduced and delayed ERD was observed for ALS patients, particularly during right-hand MI. ERD features were also correlated with ALS clinical scores, specifically disease duration, bulbar, and cognitive functions. The analyses in this study quantify abnormalities in the magnitude and timing of sensorimotor oscillations for ALS patients during MI tasks. Our findings reveal notable differences between MI and existing results on ME in ALS. The observed alterations are speculated to reflect disruptions in the underlying cortical networks involved in MI functions. Quantifying the neural dynamics of MI plays an important role in the study of EEG-based cortical markers for ALS."
31594269,"Brain neural activity is measured using electroencephalography (EEG) recording from the scalp. The EEG motor/imagery tasks help disabled people to communicate with the external environment. In this paper, robust multiscale sample entropy (MSE) and wavelet entropy measures are employed using topographic maps' analysis and tabulated form to quantify the dynamics of EEG motor movements tasks with actual and imagery opening and closing of fist or feet movements. To distinguish these conditions, we used the topographic maps which visually show the significance level of the brain regions and probes for dominant activities. The paired t-test and Posthoc Tukey test are used to find the significance levels. The topographic maps results obtained using MSE reveal that maximum electrodes show the significance in frontpolar, frontal, and few frontal and parietal brain regions at temporal scales 3, 4, 6 and 7. Moreover, it was also observed that the distribution of significance is from frontoparietal brain regions. Using wavelet entropy, the significant results are obtained at frontpolar, frontal, and few electrodes in right hemisphere. The highest significance is obtained at frontpolar electrodes followed by frontal and few central and parietal electrodes."
31585454,"To develop and implement a novel approach which combines the technique of scout EEG source imaging (ESI) with convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification of motor imagery (MI) tasks. The technique of ESI uses a boundary element method (BEM) and weighted minimum norm estimation (WMNE) to solve the EEG forward and inverse problems, respectively. Ten scouts are then created within the motor cortex to select the region of interest (ROI). We extract features from the time series of scouts using a Morlet wavelet approach. Lastly, CNN is employed for classifying MI tasks. The overall mean accuracy on the Physionet database reaches 94.5% and the individual accuracy of each task reaches 95.3%, 93.3%, 93.6%, 96% for the left fist, right fist, both fists and both feet, correspondingly, validated using ten-fold cross validation. We report an increase of up to 14.4% for overall classification compared with the competitive results from the state-of-the-art MI classification methods. Then, we add four new subjects to verify the validity of the method and the overall mean accuracy is 92.5%. Furthermore, the global classifier was adapted to single subjects improving the overall mean accuracy to 94.54%. The combination of scout ESI and CNN enhances BCI performance of decoding EEG four-class MI tasks."
31571608,"The ultimate goal of many brain-computer interface (BCI) research efforts is to provide individuals with severe motor impairments with a communication channel that they can control at will. To achieve this goal, an important system requirement is asynchronous control, whereby users can initiate intentional brain activation in a self-paced rather than system-cued manner. However, to date, asynchronous BCIs have been explored in a minority of BCI studies and their performance is generally below that of system-paced alternatives. In this paper, we present an asynchronous electroencephalography (EEG) BCI that detects a non-motor imagery cognitive task and investigated the possibility of improving its performance using error-related potentials (ErrP). Ten able-bodied adults attended two sessions of data collection each, one for training and one for testing the BCI. The visual interface consisted of a centrally located cartoon icon. For each participant, an asynchronous BCI differentiated among the idle state and a personally selected cognitive task (mental arithmetic, word generation or figure rotation). The BCI continuously analyzed the EEG data stream and displayed real-time feedback (i.e. icon fell over) upon detection of brain activity indicative of a cognitive task. The BCI also monitored the EEG signals for the presence of error-related potentials following the presentation of feedback. An ErrP classifier was invoked to automatically alter the task classifier outcome when an error-related potential was detected. The average post-error correction trial success rate across participants, 85% [Formula: see text] 12%, was significantly higher (p   <  0.05) than that pre-error correction (78% [Formula: see text] 11%). Our findings support the addition of ErrP-correction to maximize the performance of asynchronous BCIs.."
31569036,"The extraction of relevant and distinct features from the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is one of the most challenging task when implementing Brain Computer Interface (BCI) based systems. Frequency analysis techniques are recognised as one of the most suitable methods to have distinct information from EEG signals. However, existing studies use mostly classical approaches assuming that the signal is Gaussian, stationary and linear. These properties are not verified in the EEG case considering the complexity of the brain electrical activity. This paper proposes two new spectral estimators that are robust against non-Gaussian, non-linear and non-stationary signals. These two approaches use quantile regression and L<sub>1</sub>-norm regularisation to estimate the spectrum of the motor imagery (MI) related EEG. A dataset collected during a study of BCI motor imagery project conducted at Tshwane University of Technology (TUT), Pretoria, South Africa, is used to validate the proposed estimators. Experimental results demonstrate that the newly proposed approaches help improve the classification performance of MI. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed estimators, a comparative study is conducted, considering classical commonly used techniques such as FFT and Welch periodogram through 5 classification algorithms. The proposed Quantile-based spectral estimators are potential methods to improve the classification performance of the EEG-Based motor imagery systems."
31561099,"During cognitive, perceptual and sensory tasks, connectivity profile changes across different regions of the brain. Variations of such connectivity patterns between different cognitive tasks can be evaluated using pairwise synchronization measures applied to electrophysiological signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG). However, connectivity-based task recognition approaches achieving viable recognition performance have been lacking from the literature. By using several synchronization measures, we identify time lags between channel pairs during different cognitive tasks. We employed mutual information, cross correntropy, cross correlation, phase locking value, cosine similarity and nonlinear interdependence measures. In the training phase, for each type of cognitive task, we identify the time lags that maximize the average synchronization between channel pairs. These lags are used to calculate pairwise synchronization values with which we construct the train and test feature vectors for recognition of the cognitive task carried out using Fisher's linear discriminant (FLD) analysis. We tested our framework in a motor imagery activity recognition scenario on PhysioNet Motor Movement/Imagery and BCI Competition-III Ⅳa datasets. For PhysioNet dataset, average performance results ranging between % 51 and % 61 across 20 subjects. For BCI Competition-Ⅲ dataset, we achieve an average recognition performance of % 76 which is above the minimum reliable communication rate (% 70). We achieved an average accuracy over the minimum reliable communication rate on the BCI Competition-Ⅲ dataset. Performance levels were lower on the PhysioNet dataset. These results indicate that a viable task recognition system is achievable using pairwise synchronization measures evaluated at the proper task specific lags."
31543766,"Motor imagery (MI) has been widely used to operate brain-computer interface (BCI) systems for rehabilitation and some life assistive devices. However, the current performance of an MI-based BCI cannot fully meet the needs of its in-field applications. Most of the BCIs utilizing a generalized feature for all participants have been found to greatly hamper the efficacy of the BCI system. Hence, some attempts have made on the exploration of subject-dependent parameters, but it remains challenging to enhance BCI performance as expected. To this end, in this study, we used the independent component analysis (ICA), which has been proved capable of isolating the pure motor-related component from non-motor-related brain processes and artifacts and extracting the common motor-related component across MI, motor execution (ME), and motor observation (MO) conditions. Then, a sliding window approach was used to detect significant mu-suppression from the baseline using the electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha power time course and, thus, the success rate of the mu-suppression detection could be assessed on a single-trial basis. By comparing the success rates using different parameters, we further quantified the extent of the improvement in each motor condition to evaluate the effectiveness of both generalized and individualized parameters. The results showed that in ME condition, the success rate under individualized latency and that under generalized latency was 90.0% and 77.75%, respectively; in MI condition, the success rate was 74.14% for individual latency and 58.47% for generalized latency, and in MO condition, the success rate was 67.89% and 61.26% for individual and generalized latency, respectively. As can be seen, the success rate in each motor condition was significantly improved by utilizing an individualized latency compared to that using the generalized latency. Moreover, the comparison of the individualized window latencies for the mu-suppression detection across different runs of the same participant as well as across different participants showed that the window latency was significantly more consistent in the intra-subject than in the inter-subject settings. As a result, we proposed that individualizing the latency for detecting the mu-suppression feature for each participant might be a promising attempt to improve the MI-based BCI performance."
31522355,"For Brain-Computer interfaces (BCIs), system calibration is a lengthy but necessary process for successful operation. Co-adaptive BCIs aim to shorten training and imply positive motivation to users by presenting feedback already at early stages: After just 5 min of gathering calibration data, the systems are able to provide feedback and engage users in a mutual learning process. In this work, we investigate whether the retraining stage of co-adaptive BCIs can be adapted to a semi-supervised concept, where only a small amount of labeled data is available and all additional data needs to be labeled by the BCI itself. The aim of the current work was to evaluate whether a semi-supervised co-adaptive BCI could successfully compete with a supervised co-adaptive BCI model. In a supporting two-class (190 trials per condition) BCI study based on motor imagery tasks, we evaluated both approaches in two separate groups of 10 participants online, while we simulated the other approach in each group offline. Our results indicate that despite the lack of true labeled data, the semi-supervised driven BCI did not perform significantly worse (p > 0.05) than the supervised counterpart. We believe that these findings contribute to developing BCIs for long-term use, where continuous adaptation becomes imperative for maintaining meaningful BCI performance. Graphical abstract In this work, we investigate whether the retraining stage of a co-adaptive BCI can be adapted to a semi-supervised concept, where only a small amount of labeled data is available and all additional data needs to be labeled by the BCI itself.

31485883,"EEG signal can be a good alternative for disabled persons who cannot perform actions or perform them improperly. Brain computer interface (BCI) is an attractive technology which permits control and interaction with a computer or a machine using EEG signals. Brain task identification based on EEG signals is very difficult task and is still challenging researchers. In this paper, the motor imagery of left and right hand actions are identified using new features which are fed to a set of optimized SVM classifiers. Multi classifiers based classification showed having high faculty to improve the classification accuracy when using different kind or diversified features. Features selection was performed by genetic algorithm optimization. In single optimized SVM classifier, a mean classification accuracy of 89.8% was reached. To further improve the rate of classification, three SVMs classifiers have been suggested and optimized in order to find suitable features for each classifier. The three SVMs classifiers were optimized and achieved a performance mean of 94.11%. The achieved performance is a significant improvement comparing to the existing methods which does not exceed 81% while using the same database. Here, combining multi classifiers with selecting suitable features by optimization can be a good alternative for BCI applications."
31484971,"Motor imagery (MI) for target-oriented movements, which is a basis for functional activities of daily living, can be more appropriate than non-target-oriented MI as tasks to promote motor recovery or brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. This study aimed to explore different characteristics of brain activation among target-oriented kinesthetic imagery (KI) and visual imagery (VI) in the first-person (VI-1) and third-person (VI-3) perspectives. Eighteen healthy volunteers were evaluated for MI ability, trained for the three types of target-oriented MIs, and scanned using 3 T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) under MI and perceptual control conditions, presented in a block design. Post-experimental questionnaires were administered after fMRI. Common brain regions activated during the three types of MI were the left premotor area and inferior parietal lobule, irrespective of the MI modalities or perspectives. Contrast analyses showed significantly increased brain activation only in the contrast of KI versus VI-1 and KI versus VI-3 for considerably extensive brain regions, including the supplementary motor area and insula. Neural activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and cerebellum during VI-1 and KI was significantly correlated with MI ability measured by mental chronometry and a self-reported questionnaire, respectively. These results can provide a basis in developing MI-based protocols for neurorehabilitation to improve motor recovery and BCI training in severely paralyzed individuals."

The proposed algorithm using the FBCSP features generated from the supporting channel set for the principle channel significantly improved the classification performance.

31478864,"One of the challenges in motor imagery (MI) classification tasks is finding an easy-handled electroencephalogram (EEG) representation method which can preserve not only temporal features but also spatial ones. To fully utilize the features on various dimensions of EEG, a novel MI classification framework is first introduced in this paper, including a new 3D representation of EEG, a multi-branch 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) and the corresponding classification strategy. The 3D representation is generated by transforming EEG signals into a sequence of 2D array which preserves spatial distribution of sampling electrodes. The multi-branch 3D CNN and classification strategy are designed accordingly for the 3D representation. Experimental evaluation reveals that the proposed framework reaches state-of-the-art classification kappa value level and significantly outperforms other algorithms by 50% decrease in standard deviation of different subjects, which shows good performance and excellent robustness on different subjects. The framework also shows great performance with only nine sampling electrodes, which can significantly enhance its practicality. Moreover, the multi-branch structure exhibits its low latency and a strong ability in mitigating overfitting issues which often occur in MI classification because of the small training dataset."
31476743,"Electroencephalography (EEG) motor imagery classification has been widely used in healthcare applications such as mobile assistive robots and post-stroke rehabilitation. Recently, EEG motor imagery classification methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed and have achieved relatively high classification accuracy. However, these methods use single convolution scale in the CNN, while the best convolution scale differs from subject to subject. This limits the classification accuracy. Another issue is that the classification accuracy degrades when training data is limited. To address these issues, we have proposed a hybrid-scale CNN architecture with a data augmentation method for EEG motor imagery classification. Compared with several state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method achieves an average classification accuracy of 91.57% and 87.6% on two commonly used datasets, which outperforms several state-of-the-art EEG motor imagery classification methods. The proposed method effectively addresses the issues of existing CNN-based EEG motor imagery classification methods and improves the classification accuracy."
31455386,"Accidental Accidental awareness during general anesthesia (AAGA) occurs in 1-2% of high-risk practice patients and is a cause of severe psychological trauma, termed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, no monitoring techniques can accurately predict or detect AAGA. Since the first reflex for a patient during AAGA is to move, a passive brain-computer interface (BCI) based on the detection of an intention of movement would be conceivable to alert the anesthetist. However, the way in which propofol (i.e., an anesthetic commonly used for the general anesthesia induction) affects motor brain activity within the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal has been poorly investigated and is not clearly understood. For this reason, a detailed study of the motor activity behavior with a step-wise increasing dose of propofol is required and would provide a proof of concept for such an innovative BCI. The main goal of this study is to highlight the occurrence of movement attempt patterns, mainly changes in oscillations called event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS), in the EEG signal over the motor cortex, in healthy subjects, without and under propofol sedation, during four different motor tasks. MOTANA is an interventional, prospective, exploratory, physiological, monocentric, and randomized study conducted in healthy volunteers under light anesthesia, involving EEG measurements before and after target-controlled infusion of propofol at three different effect-site concentrations (0 μg.ml <sup>-1</sup>, 0.5 μg.ml <sup>-1</sup>, and 1.0 μg.ml <sup>-1</sup>). In this exploratory study, 30 healthy volunteers will perform 50 trials for the four motor tasks (real movement, motor imagery, motor imagery with median nerve stimulation, and median nerve stimulation alone) in a randomized sequence. In each conditions and for each trial, we will observe changes in terms of ERD and ERS according to the three propofol concentrations. Pre- and post-injection comparisons of propofol will be performed by paired series tests. MOTANA is an exploratory study aimed at designing an innovative BCI based on EEG-motor brain activity that would detect an attempt to move by a patient under anesthesia.

An improvement on BCIs could be achieved by enhancing brain signals from the source via subject intention-based modulation. In this work, we aim to investigate the effects of task complexity on performance of motor imagery (MI) based BCIs. In specific, we studied the effects of motor imagery of a complex task versus a simple task on discriminability of brain activation patterns using EEG. The results show an increase of up to 7.25% in BCI classification accuracy for motor imagery of the complex task in comparison to the simple task. Furthermore, spectral power analysis in low frequency bands, alpha and beta, shows a significant decrease in power value for the complex task. However, high frequency gamma band analysis unveils a significant increase for the complex task. These findings may lead to designing better BCIs with high performance."
31428313,"Significant research has been conducted in the field of brain computer interface (BCI) algorithm development, however, many of the resulting algorithms are both complex, and specific to a particular user as the most successful methodology can vary between individuals and sessions. The objective of this study was to develop a simple yet effective method of feature selection to improve the accuracy of a subject independent BCI algorithm and streamline the process of BCI algorithm development. Over the past several years, several high precision features have been suggested by researchers to classify different motor imagery tasks. This research applies fourteen of these features as a feature pool that can be used as a reference for future researchers. Additionally, we look for the most efficient feature or feature set with four different classifiers that best differentiates several motor imagery tasks. In this work we have successfully employed a feature fusion method to obtain the best sub-set of features. We have proposed a novel computer aided feature selection method to determine the best set of features for distinguishing between motor imagery tasks in lieu of the manual feature selection that has been performed in past studies. The features selected by this method were then fed into a Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, or support vector machine classifier for classification to determine the overall performance. The methods used were a novel performance based additive feature fusion algorithm working in conjunction with machine learning in order to classify the motor imagery signals into particular states. The data used for this study was collected from BCI competition III dataset IVa. The result of this algorithm was a classification accuracy of 99% for a subject independent algorithm with less computation cost compared to traditional methods, in addition to multiple feature/classifier combinations that outperform current subject independent methods. The conclusion of this study and its significance is that it developed a viable methodology for simple, efficient feature selection and BCI algorithm development, which leads to an overall increase in algorithm classification accuracy."
31421162,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a communication pathway applied for pathological analysis or functional substitution. BCI based on functional substitution enables the recognition of a subject's intention to control devices such as prosthesis and wheelchairs. Discrimination of electroencephalography (EEG) trials related to left- and right-hand movements requires complex EEG signal processing to achieve good system performance. In this study, a novel dynamic and self-adaptive algorithm (DSAA) based on the least-squares method is proposed to select the most appropriate feature extraction and classification algorithms couple for each subject. Specifically, the best couple identified during the training of the system is updated during online testing in order to check the stability of the selected couple and maintain high system accuracy. Extensive and systematic experiments were conducted on public datasets of 17 subjects in the BCI-competition and the results show an improved performance for DSAA over other selected state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed system enhanced the classification accuracy for the three chosen public datasets by 8% compared to other approaches. Moreover, the proposed system was successful in selecting the best path despite the unavailability of reference labels. Performing dynamic and self-adaptive selection for the best feature extraction and classification algorithm couple increases the recognition rate of trials despite the unavailability of reference trial labels. This approach allows the development of a complete BCI system with excellent accuracy."
31416258,"The classification recognition rate of motor imagery is a key factor to improve the performance of brain-computer interface (BCI). Thus, we propose a feature extraction method based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT), empirical mode decomposition (EMD), and approximate entropy. Firstly, the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is decomposed into a series of narrow band signals with DWT, then the sub-band signal is decomposed with EMD to get a set of stationary time series, which are called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Secondly, the appropriate IMFs for signal reconstruction are selected. Thus, the approximate entropy of the reconstructed signal can be obtained as the corresponding feature vector. Finally, support&nbsp;vector&nbsp;machine (SVM) is used to perform the classification. The proposed method solves the problem of wide frequency band coverage during EMD and further improves the classification accuracy of EEG signal motion imaging."

By using wavelet-based maximum entropy on the mean (wMEM), task-specific EEG channels are selected to predict right hand and right foot sensorimotor tasks, employing common spatial pattern (CSP) and regularized common spatial pattern (RCSP). EEG from five healthy individuals (Dataset IVa, BCI Competition III) were evaluated by a cross-subject paradigm. Prediction performance was evaluated via a two-layer feed-forward neural network, where the classifier was trained and tested by data from two subjects independently. On average, the overall mean prediction accuracies obtained using all 118 channels are (55.98±6.53) and (71.20±5.32) in cases of CSP and RCSP, respectively, which are slightly lower than the accuracies obtained using only the selected channels, i.e., (58.95±6.90) and (71.41±6.65), respectively. The highest mean prediction accuracy achieved for a specific subject pair by using selected EEG channels was on average (90.36±5.59) and outperformed that achieved by using all available channels (86.07 ± 10.71). Spatially projected cortical sources approximated using wMEM may be useful for capturing inter-subject associative sensorimotor brain dynamics and pave the way toward an enhanced subject-independent BCI."

Also, we developed a real-time health 4.0 (H4.0) architecture for brain-controlled internet of things (IoT) enabled environments (BCE), which uses the classified MI task to assist disabled persons in controlling IoT-enabled environments such as lighting and heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC). The first method for classification involves a simple and low-complex classification framework using a combination of regularized Riemannian mean (RRM) and linear SVM. Although this method performs better compared to state-of-the-art techniques, it still suffers from a nonnegligible misclassification rate. Hence, to overcome this, the second method offers a persistent decision engine (PDE) for the MI classification, which improves classification accuracy (CA) significantly. The proposed methods are validated using an in-house recorded four-class MI data set (data set I, collected over 14 subjects), and a four-class MI data set 2a of BCI competition IV (data set II, collected over 9 subjects). The proposed RRM architecture obtained average CAs of 74.30% and 67.60% when validated using datasets I and II, respectively. When analyzed along with the proposed PDE classification framework, an average CA of 92.25% on 12 subjects of data set I and 82.54% on 7 subjects of data set II is obtained. The results show that the PDE algorithm is more reliable for the classification of four-class MI and is also feasible for BCE applications. The proposed low-complex BCE architecture is implemented in real time using Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ along with the Virgo EEG data acquisition system. The hardware implementation results show that the proposed system architecture is well suited for body-wearable devices in the scenario of Health 4.0. We strongly feel that this study can aid in driving the future scope of BCE research."
31374781,"The use of robotic devices to provide active motor support and sensory feedback of ongoing motor intention, by means of a Brain Computer Interface (BCI), has received growing support by recent literature, with particular focus on neurorehabilitation therapies. At the same time, performance in the use of the BCI has become a more critical factor, since it directly influences congruency and consistency of the provided sensory feedback. As motor imagery is the mental simulation of a given movement without depending on residual function, training of patients in the use of motor imagery BCI can be extended beyond each rehabilitation session, and practiced by using simpler devices than rehabilitation robots available in the hospital. In this work, we investigated the use of haptic stimulation provided by vibrating electromagnetic motors to enhance BCI system training. The BCI is based on motor imagery of hand grasping and designed to operate a hand exoskeleton. We investigated whether haptic stimulation at fingerpads proves to be more effective than stimulation at wrist, already experimented in literature, due to the higher density of mechano-receptors. Our results did not show significant differences between the two body locations in BCI performance, yet a wider and more stable event-relateddesynchronization appeared for the finger-located stimulation. Future investigations will put in relation training with haptic feedback at fingerpads with BCI performance using the handexoskeleton, in grasping tasks that naturally involve haptic feedback at fingerpads."
31374711,"For individuals with severe motor deficiencies, controlling external devices such as robotic arms or wheelchairs can be challenging, as many devices require some degree of motor control to be operated, e.g. when controlled using a joystick. A brain-computer interface (BCI) relies only on signals from the brain and may be used as a controller instead of muscles. Motor imagery (MI) has been used in many studies as a control signal for BCIs. However, MI may not be suitable for all control purposes, and several people cannot obtain BCI control with MI. In this study, the aim was to investigate the feasibility of decoding covert speech from single-trial EEG and compare and combine it with MI. In seven healthy subjects, EEG was recorded with twenty-five channels during six different actions: Speaking three words (both covert and overt speech), two arm movements (both motor imagery and execution), and one idle class. Temporal and spectral features were derived from the epochs and classified with a random forest classifier. The average classification accuracy was $67 \pm 9$ % and $75\pm 7$ % for covert and overt speech, respectively; this was 5-10 % lower than the movement classification. The performance of the combined movement-speech decoder was $61 \pm 9$ % and $67\pm 7$ % (covert and overt), but it is possible to have more classes available for control. The possibility of using covert speech for controlling a BCI was outlined; this is a step towards a multimodal BCI system for improved usability."
31365911,"We proposed a brain-computer interface (BCI) based visual-haptic neurofeedback training (NFT) by incorporating synchronous visual scene and proprioceptive electrical stimulation feedback. The goal of this work was to improve sensorimotor cortical activations and classification performance during motor imagery (MI). In addition, their correlations and brain network patterns were also investigated respectively. 64-channel electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded in nineteen healthy subjects during MI before and after NFT. During NFT sessions, the synchronous visual-haptic feedbacks were driven by real-time lateralized relative event-related desynchronization (lrERD). By comparison between previous and posterior control sessions, the cortical activations measured by multi-band (i.e. alpha_1: 8-10 Hz, alpha_2: 11-13 Hz, beta_1: 15-20 Hz and beta_2: 22-28 Hz) absolute ERD powers and lrERD patterns were significantly enhanced after the NFT. The classification performance was also significantly improved, achieving a ~9% improvement and reaching ~85% in mean classification accuracy from a relatively poor performance. Additionally, there were significant correlations between lrERD patterns and classification accuracies. The partial directed coherence based functional connectivity (FC) networks covering the sensorimotor area also showed an increase after the NFT. These findings validate the feasibility of our proposed NFT to improve sensorimotor cortical activations and BCI performance during motor imagery. And it is promising to optimize conventional NFT manner and evaluate the effectiveness of motor training."
31362282,"The paper aims to present a method that enables the application of independent component analysis (ICA) to a low-channel EEG recording. The idea behind the method (called moving average ICA or MAICA) is to extend the original low-sensor matrix of signals by applying a set of zero-phase moving average filters to each of the recorded signals. The paper discusses the theoretical background of the MAICA algorithm and verifies its usefulness under three exemplary settings: (i) a pure mathematic system composed of ten source sinusoids; (ii) real EEG data recorded from 64 channels; (iii) real EEG data recorded from five subjects during 200 trials with motor imagery brain-computer interface. The first system shows that MAICA is able to decompose two mixed signals (composed of ten source sinusoids) into ten components with an extremely high correlation between the source patterns and identified components (99%-100%). The second system shows that when used over five channels, MAICA is able to recognize more artefact components than those recognized by classic ICA used over 64 channels. Finally, the third system demonstrates that MAICA is capable of working in an online mode without significant delays; the additional time needed to run MAICA for one trial was less than 6ms in the survey reported in the paper. The method presented in the paper should have a significant impact on all areas of medical signal processing where a large number of known and/or unknown patterns have to be retrieved in real time from complex signals recorded from a small number of external/internal body sensors."
31356896,"Impaired finger motor function in post-stroke hemiplegia is a debilitating condition with no evidence-based or accessible treatments. Here, we evaluated the neurophysiological effectiveness of direct brain control of robotic exoskeleton that provides movement support contingent with brain activity. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the neurofeedback intervention, we assessed resting-state functional connectivity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfcMRI) between the ipsilesional sensory and motor cortices before and after a single 1-h intervention. Eighteen stroke patients were randomly assigned to crossover interventions in a double-blind and sham-controlled design. One patient dropped out midway through the study, and 17 patients were included in this analysis. Interventions involved motor imagery, robotic assistance, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation administered to a paretic finger. The neurofeedback intervention delivered stimulations contingent on desynchronized ipsilesional electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations during imagined movement, and the control intervention delivered sensorimotor stimulations that were independent of EEG oscillations. There was a significant time × intervention interaction in rsfcMRI in the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex. Post-hoc analysis showed a larger gain in increased functional connectivity during the neurofeedback intervention. Although the neurofeedback intervention delivered fewer total sensorimotor stimulations compared to the sham-control, rsfcMRI in the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortices was increased during the neurofeedback intervention compared to the sham-control. Higher coactivation of the sensory and motor cortices during neurofeedback intervention enhanced rsfcMRI in the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortices. This study showed neurophysiological evidence that EEG-contingent neurofeedback is a promising strategy to induce intrinsic ipsilesional sensorimotor reorganization, supporting the importance of integrating closed-loop sensorimotor processing at a neurophysiological level."
31354460,"To maximize brain plasticity after stroke, a plethora of rehabilitation strategies have been explored. These include the use of intensive motor training, motor-imagery (MI), and action-observation (AO). Growing evidence of the positive impact of virtual reality (VR) techniques on recovery following stroke has been shown. However, most VR tools are designed to exploit active movement, and hence patients with low level of motor control cannot fully benefit from them. Consequently, the idea of directly training the central nervous system has been promoted by utilizing MI with electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). To date, detailed information on which VR strategies lead to successful functional recovery is still largely missing and very little is known on how to optimally integrate EEG-based BCIs and VR paradigms for stroke rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of an EEG-based BCI-VR system using a MI paradigm for post-stroke upper limb rehabilitation on functional assessments, and related changes in MI ability and brain imaging. To achieve this, a 60 years old male chronic stroke patient was recruited. The patient underwent a 3-week intervention in a clinical environment, resulting in 10 BCI-VR training sessions. The patient was assessed before and after intervention, as well as on a one-month follow-up, in terms of clinical scales and brain imaging using functional MRI (fMRI). Consistent with prior research, we found important improvements in upper extremity scores (Fugl-Meyer) and identified increases in brain activation measured by fMRI that suggest neuroplastic changes in brain motor networks. This study expands on the current body of evidence, as more data are needed on the effect of this type of interventions not only on functional improvement but also on the effect of the intervention on plasticity through brain imaging."
31341093,"Learning the structures and unknown correlations of a motor imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) signal is important for its classification. It is also a major challenge to obtain good classification accuracy from the increased number of classes and increased variability from different people. In this study, a four-class MI task is investigated. An end-to-end novel hybrid deep learning scheme is developed to decode the MI task from EEG data. The proposed algorithm consists of two parts: a. A one-versus-rest filter bank common spatial pattern is adopted to preprocess and pre-extract the features of the four-class MI signal. b. A hybrid deep network based on the convolutional neural network and long-term short-term memory network is proposed to extract and learn the spatial and temporal features of the MI signal simultaneously. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a hybrid deep network framework to improve the classification accuracy of the four-class MI-EEG signal. The hybrid deep network is a subject-independent shared neural network, which means it can be trained by using the training data from all subjects to form one model. The classification performance obtained by the proposed algorithm on brain-computer interface (BCI) competition IV dataset 2a in terms of accuracy is 83% and Cohen's kappa value is 0.80. Finally, the shared hybrid deep network is evaluated by every subject respectively, and the experimental results illustrate that the shared neural network has satisfactory accuracy. Thus, the proposed algorithm could be of great interest for real-life BCIs."
31326660,"Multi-channel EEG data are usually necessary for spatial pattern identification in motor imagery (MI)-based brain computer interfaces (BCIs). To some extent, signals from some channels containing redundant information and noise may degrade BCI performance. We assume that the channels related to MI should contain common information when participants are executing the MI tasks. Based on this hypothesis, a correlation-based channel selection (CCS) method is proposed to select the channels that contained more correlated information in this study. The aim is to improve the classification performance of MI-based BCIs. Furthermore, a novel regularized common spatial pattern (RCSP) method is used to extract effective features. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel is trained to accurately identify the MI tasks. An experimental study is implemented on three public EEG datasets (BCI competition IV dataset 1, BCI competition III dataset IVa and BCI competition III dataset IIIa) to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The results show that the CCS algorithm obtained superior classification accuracy (78% versus 56.4% for dataset1, 86.6% versus 76.5% for dataset 2 and 91.3% versus 85.1% for dataset 3) compared to the algorithm using all channels (AC), when CSP is used to extract the features. Furthermore, RCSP could further improve the classification accuracy (81.6% for dataset1, 87.4% for dataset2 and 91.9% for dataset 3), when CCS is used to select the channels."
31321955,"The number of electrode channels in a brain-computer interface affects not only its classification performance, but also its convenience in practical applications. However, an effective method for determining the number of channels has not yet been established for motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces. This paper proposes a novel evolutionary search algorithm, binary quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization, for channel selection, which is implemented in a wrapping manner, coupling common spatial pattern for feature extraction, and support vector machine for classification. The fitness function of binary quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization is defined as the weighted sum of classification error rate and relative number of channels. The classification performance of the binary quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization-based common spatial pattern was evaluated on an electroencephalograph data set and an electrocorticography data set. It was subsequently compared with that of other three common spatial pattern methods: using the channels selected by binary particle swarm optimization, all channels in raw data sets, and channels selected manually. Experimental results showed that the proposed binary quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization-based common spatial pattern method outperformed the other three common spatial pattern methods, significantly decreasing the classification error rate and number of channels, as compared to the common spatial pattern method using whole channels in raw data sets. The proposed method can significantly improve the practicability and convenience of a motor imagery-based brain-computer interface system."
31306609,"Purpose Speech motor control relies on neural processes for generating sensory expectations using an efference copy mechanism to maintain accurate productions. The N100 auditory event-related potential (ERP) has been identified as a possible neural marker of the efference copy with a reduced amplitude during active listening while speaking when compared to passive listening. This study investigates N100 suppression while controlling a motor imagery speech synthesizer brain-computer interface (BCI) with instantaneous auditory feedback to determine whether similar mechanisms are used for monitoring BCI-based speech output that may both support BCI learning through existing speech motor networks and be used as a clinical marker for the speech network integrity in individuals without severe speech and physical impairments. Method The motor-induced N100 suppression is examined based on data from 10 participants who controlled a BCI speech synthesizer using limb motor imagery. We considered listening to auditory target stimuli (without motor imagery) in the BCI study as passive listening and listening to BCI-controlled speech output (with motor imagery) as active listening since audio output depends on imagined movements. The resulting ERP was assessed for statistical significance using a mixed-effects general linear model. Results Statistically significant N100 ERP amplitude differences were observed between active and passive listening during the BCI task. Post hoc analyses confirm the N100 amplitude was suppressed during active listening. Conclusion Observation of the N100 suppression suggests motor planning brain networks are active as participants control the BCI synthesizer, which may aid speech BCI mastery."
31285468,"The understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms responsible for motor imagery (MI) is essential for the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and bioprosthetics. Our magnetoencephalographic (MEG) experiments with voluntary participants confirm the existence of two types of motor imagery, kinesthetic imagery (KI) and visual imagery (VI), distinguished by activation and inhibition of different brain areas in motor-related α- and β-frequency regions. Although the brain activity corresponding to MI is usually observed in specially trained subjects or athletes, we show that it is also possible to identify particular features of MI in untrained subjects. Similar to real movement, KI implies muscular sensation when performing an imaginary moving action that leads to event-related desynchronization (ERD) of motor-associated brain rhythms. By contrast, VI refers to visualization of the corresponding action that results in event-related synchronization (ERS) of α- and β-wave activity. A notable difference between KI and VI groups occurs in the frontal brain area. In particular, the analysis of evoked responses shows that in all KI subjects the activity in the frontal cortex is suppressed during MI, while in the VI subjects the frontal cortex is always active. The accuracy in classification of left-arm and right-arm MI using artificial intelligence is similar for KI and VI. Since untrained subjects usually demonstrate the VI imagery mode, the possibility to increase the accuracy for VI is in demand for BCIs. The application of artificial neural networks allows us to classify MI in raising right and left arms with average accuracy of 70% for both KI and VI using appropriate filtration of input signals. The same average accuracy is achieved by optimizing MEG channels and reducing their number to only 13."
31275105,"Hundreds of millions of general anesthesia are performed each year on patients all over the world. Among these patients, 0.1-0.2% are victims of Accidental Awareness during General Anesthesia (AAGA), i.e., an unexpected awakening during a surgical procedure under general anesthesia. Although anesthesiologists try to closely monitor patients using various techniques to prevent this terrifying phenomenon, there is currently no efficient solution to accurately detect its occurrence. We propose the conception of an innovative passive brain-computer interface (BCI) based on an intention of movement to prevent AAGA. Indeed, patients typically try to move to alert the medical staff during an AAGA, only to discover that they are unable to. First, we examine the challenges of such a BCI, i.e., the lack of a trigger to facilitate when to look for an intention to move, as well as the necessity for a high classification accuracy. Then, we present a solution that incorporates Median Nerve Stimulation (MNS). We investigate the specific modulations that MNS causes in the motor cortex and confirm that they can be altered by an intention of movement. Finally, we perform experiments on 16 healthy participants to assess whether an MI-based BCI using MNS is able to generate high classification accuracies. Our results show that MNS may provide a foundation for an innovative BCI that would allow the detection of AAGA."
31252557,"Various convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches have been recently proposed to improve the performance of motor imagery based-brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, the classification accuracy of CNNs is compromised when target data are distorted. Specifically for motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG), the measured signals, even from the same person, are not consistent and can be significantly distorted. To overcome these limitations, we propose to apply a capsule network (CapsNet) for learning various properties of EEG signals, thereby achieving better and more robust performance than previous CNN methods. The proposed CapsNet-based framework classifies the two-class motor imagery, namely right-hand and left-hand movements. The motor imagery EEG signals are first transformed into 2D images using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) algorithm and then used for training and testing the capsule network. The performance of the proposed framework was evaluated on the BCI competition IV 2b dataset. The proposed framework outperformed state-of-the-art CNN-based methods and various conventional machine learning approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach for classification of motor imagery EEG signals."

Several research projects have used this data to test the detection of visual stimuli, classification and selection of characteristics of brain signals, EEG preprocessing and for optimization processes based on heuristic algorithms and algorithms based upon collective animal intelligence.

31235800,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems having the ability to classify brain waves with greater accuracy are highly desirable. To this end, a number of techniques have been proposed aiming to be able to classify brain waves with high accuracy. However, the ability to classify brain waves and its implementation in real-time is still limited. In this study, we introduce a novel scheme for classifying motor imagery (MI) tasks using electroencephalography (EEG) signal that can be implemented in real-time having high classification accuracy between different MI tasks. We propose a new predictor, OPTICAL, that uses a combination of common spatial pattern (CSP) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network for obtaining improved MI EEG signal classification. A sliding window approach is proposed to obtain the time-series input from the spatially filtered data, which becomes input to the LSTM network. Moreover, instead of using LSTM directly for classification, we use regression based output of the LSTM network as one of the features for classification. On the other hand, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the CSP variance based features. The features in the reduced dimensional plane after performing LDA are used as input to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier together with the regression based feature obtained from the LSTM network. The regression based feature further boosts the performance of the proposed OPTICAL predictor. OPTICAL showed significant improvement in the ability to accurately classify left and right-hand MI tasks on two publically available datasets. The improvements in the average misclassification rates are 3.09% and 2.07% for BCI Competition IV Dataset I and GigaDB dataset, respectively. The Matlab code is available at https://github.com/ShiuKumar/OPTICAL ."
31233971,"Noninvasive brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for movement control via an electroencephalogram (EEG) have been extensively investigated. However, most previous studies decoded user intention for movement directions based on sensorimotor rhythms during motor imagery. BCI systems based on mapping imagery movement of body parts (e.g., left or right hands) to movement directions (left or right directional movement of a machine or cursor) are less intuitive and less convenient due to the complex training procedures. Thus, direct decoding methods for detecting user intention about movement directions are urgently needed. Here, we describe a novel direct decoding method for user intention about the movement directions using the echo state network and Gaussian readouts. Importantly parameters in the network were optimized using the genetic algorithm method to achieve better decoding performance. We tested the decoding performance of this method with four healthy subjects and an inexpensive wireless EEG system containing 14 channels and then compared the performance outcome with that of a conventional machine learning method. We showed that this decoding method successfully classified eight directions of intended movement (approximately 95% of an accuracy). We suggest that the echo state network and Gaussian readouts can be a useful decoding method to directly read user intention of movement directions even using an inexpensive and portable EEG system."
31217132,"This paper is focused on the experimental approach to explore the potential of independent component analysis (ICA) in the context of motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI). We presented a simple and efficient algorithmic framework of ICA-based MI BCI (ICA-MIBCI) for the evaluation of four classical ICA algorithms (Infomax, FastICA, Jade, and Sobi) as well as a simplified Infomax (sInfomax). Two novel performance indexes, self-test accuracy and the number of invalid ICA filters, were employed to assess the performance of MIBCI based on different ICA variants. As a reference method, common spatial pattern (CSP), a commonly-used spatial filtering method, was employed for the comparative study between ICA-MIBCI and CSP-MIBCI. The experimental results showed that sInfomax-based spatial filters exhibited significantly better transferability in session to session and subject to subject transfer as compared to CSP-based spatial filters. The online experiment was also introduced to demonstrate the practicability and feasibility of sInfomax-based MIBCI. However, four classical ICA variants, especially FastICA, Jade, and Sobi, performed much worse as compared to sInfomax and CSP in terms of classification accuracy and stability. We consider that conventional ICA-based spatial filtering methods tend to be overfitting while applied to real-life electroencephalogram data. Nevertheless, the sInfomax-based experimental results indicate that ICA methods have a great space for improvement in the application of MIBCI. We believe that this paper could bring forth new ideas for the practical implementation of ICA-MIBCI."
31217122,"One of the major limitations of motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is its long calibration time. Due to between sessions/subjects variations in the properties of brain signals, typically, a large amount of training data needs to be collected at the beginning of each session to calibrate the parameters of the BCI system for the target user. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach on the classification domain to reduce the calibration time without sacrificing the classification accuracy of MI-BCI. Thus, when only few subject-specific trials are available for training, the estimation of the classification parameters is improved by incorporating previously recorded data from other users. For this purpose, a regularization parameter is added to the objective function of the classifier to make the classification parameters as close as possible to the classification parameters of the previous users who have feature spaces similar to that of the target subject. In this paper, a new similarity measure based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL) is used to measure the similarity between two feature spaces obtained using subject-specific common spatial patterns (CSP). The proposed transfer learning approach is applied on the logistic regression classifier and evaluated using three datasets. The results showed that compared with the subject-specific classifier, the proposed weighted transfer learning classifier improved the classification results, particularly when few subject-specific trials were available for training (p < 0.05). Importantly, this improvement was more pronounced for users with medium and poor accuracy. Moreover, the statistical results showed that the proposed weighted transfer learning classifier performed significantly better than the considered comparable baseline algorithms."
31214255,"Due to the redundant information contained in multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, the classification accuracy of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems may deteriorate to a large extent. Channel selection methods can help to remove task-independent electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and hence improve the performance of BCI systems. However, in different frequency bands, brain areas associated with motor imagery are not exactly the same, which will result in the inability of traditional channel selection methods to extract effective EEG features. To address the above problem, this paper proposes a novel method based on common spatial pattern- (CSP-) rank channel selection for multifrequency band EEG (CSP-R-MF). It combines the multiband signal decomposition filtering and the CSP-rank channel selection methods to select significant channels, and then linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to calculate the classification accuracy. The results showed that our proposed CSP-R-MF method could significantly improve the average classification accuracy compared with the CSP-rank channel selection method."
31214009,"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) translate neuronal information into commands to control external software or hardware, which can improve the quality of life for both healthy and disabled individuals. Here, a multi-modal BCI which combines motor imagery (MI) and steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is proposed to achieve stable control of a quadcopter in three-dimensional physical space. The complete information common spatial pattern (CICSP) method is used to extract two MI features to control the quadcopter to fly left-forward and right-forward, and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is employed to perform the SSVEP classification for rise and fall. Eye blinking is designed to switch these two modes while hovering. Real-time feedback is provided to subjects by a global camera. Two flight tasks were conducted in physical space in order to certify the reliability of the BCI system. Subjects were asked to control the quadcopter to fly forward along the zig-zag pattern to pass through a gate in the relatively simple task. For the other complex task, the quadcopter was controlled to pass through two gates successively according to an S-shaped route. The performance of the BCI system is quantified using suitable metrics and subjects are able to acquire 86.5% accuracy for the complicated flight task. It is demonstrated that the multi-modal BCI has the ability to increase the accuracy rate, reduce the task burden, and improve the performance of the BCI system in the real world."
31211812,"A brain-computer interface (BCI), based on motor imagery EEG, uses information extracted from the electroencephalography signals generated by a person who intends to perform any action. One of the most important issues of current research is how to detect automatically whether the user intends to send some message to a certain device. This study presents a proposal, based on a hierarchical structured system, for recognising intentional and non-intentional mental tasks on a BCI system by applying machine learning techniques to the EEG signals. First-level clustering is performed to distinguish between intentional control (IC) and non-intentional control (NC) state patterns. Then, the patterns recognised as IC are passed on to a second stage where supervised learning techniques are used to classify them. In BCI applications, it is critical to correctly classify NC states with a low false positive rate (FPR) to avoid undesirable effects. According to the literature, we selected a maximum FPR of 10%. Under these conditions, our proposal achieved an average test accuracy of 66.6%, with an 8.2% FPR, for the BCI competition IIIa dataset. The main contribution of this paper is the hierarchical approach, based on machine learning paradigms, which performs intentional and non-intentional discrimination and, depending on the case, classifies the intended command selected by the user."
31199263,"This paper presents a novel feature extraction approach for motor imagery classification overcoming the weakness of conventional common spatial pattern (CSP) methods, especially for small sample settings. We consider local CSPs generated from individual channels and their neighbors (termed ""local regions"") rather than a global CSP generated from all channels. The novelty is to select a few good local regions using interquartile range (IQR) or an ""above the mean"" rule based on variance ratio dispersion score (VRDS) and inter-class feature distance (ICFD); instead of computationally expensive cross-validation method. Furthermore, we develop frequency optimization using filter banks by extending the VRDS and ICFD to frequency-optimized local CSPs. The proposed methods are tested on three publicly available brain-computer interface (BCI) datasets: BCI competition III dataset IVa, BCI competition IV dataset I, and BCI competition IV dataset IIb. The proposed method exhibits substantially improved classification accuracy compared to recent related motor imagery (MI) classification methods."
31191948,"Brain computer interface is an emerging technology to treat the sequelae of stroke. The purpose of this study was to explore the motor imagery related desynchronization of sensorimotor rhythms of stroke patients and to assess the efficacy of an upper limb neurorehabilitation therapy based on functional electrical stimulation controlled by a brain computer interface. Eight severe chronic stroke patients were recruited. The study consisted of two stages: screening and therapy. During screening, the ability of patients to desynchronize the contralateral oscillatory sensorimotor rhythms by motor imagery of the most affected hand was assessed. In the second stage, a therapeutic intervention was performed. It involved 20 sessions where an electrical stimulator was activated when the patient's cerebral activity related to motor imagery was detected. The upper limb was assessed, before and after the intervention, by the Fugl-Meyer score (primary outcome). Spasticity, motor activity, range of movement and quality of life were also evaluated (secondary outcomes). Desynchronization was identified in all screened patients. Significant post-treatment improvement (<i>p</i> < 0.05) was detected in the primary outcome measure and in the majority of secondary outcome scores. The results suggest that the proposed therapy could be beneficial in the neurorehabilitation of stroke individuals."
31191631,"Due to the nonlinear and high-dimensional characteristics of motor imagery electroencephalography (MI-EEG), it can be challenging to get high online accuracy. As a nonlinear dimension reduction method, landmark maximum variance unfolding (L-MVU) can completely retain the nonlinear features of MI-EEG. However, L-MVU still requires considerable computation costs for out-of-sample data. An incremental version of L-MVU (denoted as IL-MVU) is proposed in this paper. The low-dimensional representation of the training data is generated by L-MVU. For each out-of-sample data, its nearest neighbors will be found in the high-dimensional training samples and the corresponding reconstruction weight matrix be calculated to generate its low-dimensional representation as well. IL-MVU is further combined with the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT), which develops a hybrid feature extraction method (named as IL-MD). IL-MVU is applied to extract the nonlinear features of the specific subband signals, which are reconstructed by DTCWT and have the obvious event-related synchronization/event-related desynchronization phenomenon. The average energy features of <i>α</i> and <i>β</i> waves are calculated simultaneously. The two types of features are fused and are evaluated by a linear discriminant analysis classifier. Based on the two public datasets with 12 subjects, extensive experiments were conducted. The average recognition accuracies of 10-fold cross-validation are 92.50% on Dataset 3b and 88.13% on Dataset 2b, and they gain at least 1.43% and 3.45% improvement, respectively, compared to existing methods. The experimental results show that IL-MD can extract more accurate features with relatively lower consumption cost, and it also has better feature visualization and self-adaptive characteristics to subjects. The <i>t</i>-test results and Kappa values suggest the proposed feature extraction method reaches statistical significance and has high consistency in classification."
31191218,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) benefit greatly from performance feedback, but current systems lack automatic, task-independent feedback. Cortical responses elicited from user error have the potential to serve as state-based feedback to BCI decoders. To gain a better understanding of local error potentials, we investigate responsive cortical power underlying error-related potentials (ErrPs) from the human cortex during a one-dimensional center-out BCI task, tracking the topography of high-gamma (70-100 Hz) band power (HBP) specific to BCI error. We measured electrocorticography (ECoG) in three human subjects during dynamic, continuous control over BCI cursor velocity. Subjects used motor imagery and rest to move the cursor toward and subsequently dwell within a target region. We then identified and labeled epochs where the BCI decoder incorrectly moved the cursor in the direction opposite of the subject's expectations (i.e., BCI error). We found increased HBP in various cortical areas 100-500 ms following BCI error with respect to epochs of correct, intended control. Significant responses were noted in primary somatosensory, motor, premotor, and parietal areas and generally regardless of whether the subject was using motor imagery or rest to move the cursor toward the target. Parts of somatosensory, temporal, and parietal areas exclusively had increased HBP when subjects were using motor imagery. In contrast, only part of the parietal cortex near the angular gyrus exclusively had an increase in HBP during rest. This investigation is, to our knowledge, the first to explore cortical fields changes in the context of continuous control in ECoG BCI. We present topographical changes in HBP characteristic specific to the generation of error. By focusing on continuous control, instead of on discrete control for simple selection, we investigate a more naturalistic setting and provide high ecological validity for characterizing error potentials. Such potentials could be considered as design elements for co-adaptive BCIs in the future as task-independent feedback to the decoder, allowing for more robust and individualized BCIs."
31180893,"The brain-computer interface establishes a direct communication pathway between the human brain and an external device by recognizing specific patterns in cortical activities. The principle of hybridization stands for combining at least two different BCI modalities into a single interface with the aim of improving the information transfer rate by increasing the recognition accuracy and number of choices available for the user. This study proposes a simultaneous hybrid BCI system that recognizes the motor imagery (MI) and the steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) using the EEG signals from a dual-channel EEG setting with sensors placed over the central area (C3 and C4 channels). The data processing implements a supervised optimization algorithm for the feature extraction, named the common frequency pattern, which finds the optimal spectral filter that maximizes the separability of the data by classes. The experiment compares the classification accuracy in a two-class task using the MI, SSVEP and hybrid approaches on seventeen healthy 18-29 years old subjects with various dual-channel setups and complete set of thirty EEG electrodes. The designed system reaches a high accuracy of 97.4 ± 1.1% in the hybrid task using the C3-C4 channel configuration, which is marginally lower than the 98.8 ± 0.5% accuracy achieved with the complete set of channels while applying the support vector classifier; in the plain SSVEP task the accuracy drops from 91.3 ± 3.9% to 86.0 ± 2.5% while moving from the occipital to central area under the dual-channel condition. The results demonstrate that by combining the principles of hybridization and data-driven spectral filtering for the feature selection it is feasible to compensate a lack of spatial information and implement the proposed BCI using a portable few channel EEG device even under sub-optimal conditions for the sensors placement."
31180829,"This single-arm multisite trial investigates the efficacy of the neurostyle brain exercise therapy towards enhanced recovery (nBETTER) system, an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) employing visual feedback for upper-limb stroke rehabilitation, and the presence of EEG correlates of mental fatigue during BCI usage. A total of 13 recruited stroke patients underwent thrice-weekly nBETTER therapy coupled with standard arm therapy over six weeks. Upper-extremity Fugl-Meyer motor assessment (FMA) scores were measured at baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 6), and follow-ups (weeks 12 and 24). In total, 11/13 patients (mean age 55.2 years old, mean post-stroke duration 333.7 days, mean baseline FMA 35.5) completed the study. Significant FMA gains relative to baseline were observed at weeks 6 and 24. Retrospectively comparing to the standard arm therapy (SAT) control group and BCI with haptic knob (BCI-HK) intervention group from a previous similar study, the SAT group had no significant gains, whereas the BCI-HK group had significant gains at weeks 6, 12, and 24. EEG analysis revealed significant positive correlations between relative beta power and BCI performance in the frontal and central brain regions, suggesting that mental fatigue may contribute to poorer BCI performance. nBETTER, an EEG-based MI-BCI employing only visual feedback, helps stroke survivors sustain short-term FMA improvement. Analysis of EEG relative beta power indicates that mental fatigue may be present. This study adds nBETTER to the growing literature of safe and effective stroke rehabilitation MI-BCI, and suggests an additional fatigue-monitoring role in future such BCI."
31163204,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) translate brain activity into control signals or commands for a device. Motor imagery of the limbs allows for modulating the sensorimotor rhythms (SMR), but there are up to 30% of the participants for whom electroencephalography (EEG) based SMR-BCI cannot detect any imagery-related changes. Individual variables, such as ability to concentrate on a task and error duration in a two-hand visuomotor coordination (VMC) task have been previously found to predict accuracy in an SMR-BCI. A first study attempted to substantiate those predictors by introducing a 30 min relaxation or VMC training period prior to an SMR-BCI session, but performance did not increase when compared to a control group. As the predictor training may have been too short, we applied 4 such training sessions on consecutive days in the current study. In a pre-post design, SMR-BCI accuracy of n = 39 participants increased from session 1 before to session 2 after the predictor training. While the manipulation of the predictor variables was successful, there was no effect on SMR-BCI performance. BCI accuracy correlated positively with the neurophysiological SMR predictor identified by Blankertz et al. [3], consolidating its predictive value, and with the state mindfulness scale. No other psychological predictor could be identified or replicated. Further studies should therefore focus more on delineating (partially) replicated or potential predictors such as VMC or mindfulness to help refining a sound model to predict SMR-BCI accuracy."
31158476,"An important goal in Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI) is to find and enhance procedural strategies for users for whom BCI control is not sufficiently accurate. To address this challenge, we conducted offline analyses and online experiments to test whether the classification of different types of motor imagery could be improved when the training of the classifier was performed on the data obtained with the assistive muscular stimulation below the motor threshold. 10 healthy participants underwent three different types of experimental conditions: a) Motor imagery (MI) of hands and feet b) sensory threshold neuromuscular electrical stimulation (STM) of hands and feet while resting and c) sensory threshold neuromuscular electrical stimulation during performance of motor imagery (BOTH). Also, another group of 10 participants underwent conditions a) and c). Then, online experiments with 15 users were performed. These subjects received neurofeedback during MI using classifiers calibrated either on MI or BOTH data recorded in the same experiment. Offline analyses showed that decoding MI alone using a classifier based on BOTH resulted in a better BCI accuracy compared to using a classifier based on MI alone. Online experiments confirmed accuracy improvement of MI alone being decoded with the classifier trained on BOTH data. In addition, we observed that the performance in MI condition could be predicted on the basis of a more pronounced connectivity within sensorimotor areas in the frequency bands providing the best performance in BOTH. These finding might offer a new avenue for training SMR-based BCI systems particularly for users having difficulties to achieve efficient BCI control. It might also be an alternative strategy for users who cannot perform real movements but still have remaining afferent pathways (e.g., ALS and stroke patients)."
31144639,"A stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is critically reduced or blocked, potentially resulting in motor paralysis. One of the most promising and effective neurorehabilitation methods for strokes is a closed-loop brain-computer interface (BCI) based on the motor imagery (MI). For the design of MI-based BCI, action observation (AO) during MI facilitates the detection of a user's motor intention. In this paper, we investigated whether or not the AO's targeted objects (the hand of a participant or another person) affects brain activity during MI. To investigate the differences in brain activity induced by the targeted objection, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) data of 15 healthy right-handed males during three different conditions: 1) MI and AO of a participant's hand (MI + ownAO); 2) MI and AO of a non-participant's hand (MI + otherAO); and 3) MI only. The results showed that the event-related desynchronization (ERD) responses in the alpha frequency band (8-13 Hz) during MI + ownAO over the sensorimotor area (at the C3 and C4 channel locations) were stronger than those during the other two conditions. The results also showed that the difference between the participants' and non-participants' hands affected ERD responses during MI + ownAO and MI + otherAO."
31141703,"Motor imagery classification, an important branch of brain-computer interface (BCI), recognizes the intention of subjects to control external auxiliary equipment. Therefore, EEG-based motor imagery classification has received increasing attention in the fields of neuroscience. The common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm has recently achieved great success in motor imagery classification. However, varying discriminative frequency bands and few-channel EEG limit the performance of CSP. A class discrepancy-guided sub-band filter-based CSP (CDFCSP) algorithm is proposed to automatically recognize and augment the discriminative frequency bands for CSP algorithms. Specifically, a priori knowledge and templates obtained from the training set were applied as the design guidelines of the class discrepancy-guided sub-band filter (CDF). Second, a filter bank CSP was used to extract features from EEG traces filtered by the CDF. Finally, the CSP features of multiple frequency bands were leveraged to train linear support vector machine classifier and generate prediction. BCI competition IV datasets 2a and 2b, which include EEGs from 18 subjects, were used to validate the performance improvement provided by the CDF. Student's t-tests of the CDFCSP versus the filter bank CSP without the CDF showed that the performance improvement was significant (i.e., p-values of 0.040 and 0.032 for the ratio and normalization mode CDFCSP, respectively). The experiments show that the proposed CDFCSP improves the CSP algorithm and outperforms the other state-of-the-art algorithms evaluated in this paper. The increased performance of the proposed CDFCSP algorithm can promote the application of BCI systems."
31127535,"This work presents a classification performance comparison between different frameworks for functional connectivity evaluation and complex network feature extraction aiming to distinguish motor imagery classes in electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The analysis was performed in two online datasets: (1) a classical benchmark-the BCI competition IV dataset 2a-allowing a comparison with a representative set of strategies previously employed in this BCI paradigm and (2) a statistically representative dataset for signal processing technique comparisons over 52 subjects. Besides exploring three classical similarity measures-Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, and mean phase coherence-this work also proposes a recurrence-based alternative for estimating EEG brain functional connectivity, which takes into account the recurrence density between pairwise electrodes over a time window. These strategies were followed by graph feature evaluation considering clustering coefficient, degree, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. The features were selected by Fisher's discriminating ratio and classification was performed by a least squares classifier in agreement with classical and online BCI processing strategies. The results revealed that the recurrence-based approach for functional connectivity evaluation was significantly better than the other frameworks, which is probably associated with the use of higher order statistics underlying the electrode joint probability estimation and a higher capability of capturing nonlinear inter-relations. There were no significant differences in performance among the evaluated graph features, but the eigenvector centrality was the best feature regarding processing time. Finally, the best ranked graph-based attributes were found in classical EEG motor cortex positions for the subjects with best performances, relating functional organization and motor activity. Graphical Abstract Evaluating functional connectivity based on Space-Time Recurrence Counting for motor imagery classification in brain-computer interfaces. Recurrences are evaluated between electrodes over a time window, and, after a density threshold, the electrodes adjacency matrix is stablish, leading to a graph. Graph-based topological measures are used for motor imagery classification."
31110515,"Stroke is a leading cause of motor disability worldwide. Upper limb rehabilitation is particularly challenging since approximately 35% of patients recover significant hand function after 6 months of the stroke's onset. Therefore, new therapies, especially those based on brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and robotic assistive devices, are currently under research. Electroencephalography (EEG) acquired brain rhythms in alpha and beta bands, during motor tasks, such as motor imagery/intention (MI), could provide insight of motor-related neural plasticity occurring during a BCI intervention. Hence, a longitudinal analysis of subacute stroke patients' brain rhythms during a BCI coupled to robotic device intervention was performed in this study. Data of 9 stroke patients were acquired across 12 sessions of the BCI intervention. Alpha and beta event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) trends across sessions and their association with time since stroke onset and clinical upper extremity recovery were analyzed, using correlation and linear stepwise regression, respectively. More EEG channels presented significant ERD/ERS trends across sessions related with time since stroke onset, in beta, compared to alpha. Linear models implied a moderate relationship between alpha rhythms in frontal, temporal, and parietal areas with upper limb motor recovery and suggested a strong association between beta activity in frontal, central, and parietal regions with upper limb motor recovery. Higher association of beta with both time since stroke onset and upper limb motor recovery could be explained by beta relation with closed-loop communication between the sensorimotor cortex and the paralyzed upper limb, and alpha being probably more associated with motor learning mechanisms. The association between upper limb motor recovery and beta activations reinforces the hypothesis that broader regions of the cortex activate during movement tasks as a compensatory mechanism in stroke patients with severe motor impairment. Therefore, EEG across BCI interventions could provide valuable information for prognosis and BCI cortical activity targets."
31096192,"Graph signal processing (GSP) concepts are exploited for brain activity decoding and particularly the detection and recognition of a motor imagery (MI) movement. A novel signal analytic technique that combines graph Fourier transform (GFT) with estimates of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) and discriminative learning is introduced as a means to recover the subject's intention from the multichannel signal. Adopting a multi-view perspective, based on the popular concept of co-existing and interacting brain rhythms, a multilayer network model is first built from empirical data and its connectivity graph is used to derive the GFT-basis. A personalized decoding scheme supporting a binary decision, either 'left versus right' or 'rest versus MI', is crafted from a small set of training trials. Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity from 12 volunteers recorded during two randomly alternating, externally cued, MI tasks (clenching either left or right fist) and a rest condition is used to introduce and validate our methodology. In addition, the introduced methodology was further validated based on dataset IVa of BCI III competition. Our GFT-domain decoding scheme achieves nearly optimal performance and proves superior to alternative techniques that are very popular in the field. At a conceptual level, our work suggests a fruitful way to introduce network neuroscience in BCI research. At a more practical level, it is characterized by efficiency. Training is realized using a small number of exemplar trials and decoding requires very simple operations that leaves room for real-time implementation."
31095507,"The main idea of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is to facilitate the lives of patients having difficulties to move their muscles due to a disorder of their motor nervous systems but healthy cognitive functions. BCIs are usually electroencephalography (EEG)-based, and the success of the BCIs relies on the precision of signal preprocessing, detection of distinctive features, usage of suitable classifiers and selection of effective channels. In this study, a two-stage channel selection and local transformation-based feature extraction are proposed for the classification of motor imagery/movement tasks. In the first stage of the channel selection, the channels were combined according to the neurophysiological information about brain functions acquired from the literature, then averaged and a single channel was formed. In the second stage, selective channels were specified with the common spatial pattern-linear discriminant analysis (CSP-LDA)-based sequential channel removal. After the channel selection phase, the feature extraction was carried out with local transformation-based methods (LTBM): local centroid pattern (LCP), one-dimensional-local gradient pattern (1D-LGP), local neighborhood descriptive pattern (LNDP) and one-dimensional-local ternary pattern (1D-LTP). The distinctions and deficiencies of these methods were compared with other methods in the literature and the classification performances of the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and the support vector machines (SVM) were evaluated. As a result, the proposed methods yielded the highest average classification accuracies as 99.34%, 95.95%, 98.66% and 99.90% with the LCP, 1D-LGP, LNDP and 1D-LTP when using k-NN, respectively. The two-stage channel selection and 1D-LTP method showed promising results for recognition of motor tasks. The LTBM will contribute to the development of EEG-based BCIs with the advantages of high classification accuracy, easy implementation and low computational complexity."
31095487,"One of the main issues restricting the practical efficiency of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems is the inevitable occurrence of physiological artifacts during electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. The effects of the artifacts are, however, mostly discarded in practical BCI systems, due to the time-consuming and complicated computational processes. This paper presents the influences of the artifacts and the efficiency of reducing these influences in a practical BCI. Ocular and muscular artifacts are considered due to the high-amplitude and frequent presence. The paradigm is designed based on the mental controlling of a radio-control (RC) car. Two motor imagery commands, containing the imagination of movement of left/right hand, are used to navigate the BCI-based RC car to turn left/right. The results indicate that the artifacts can highly affect the system performance; reducing their influence significantly improves the efficiency."
31075785,"Brain computer interfacing (BCI) is a promising method to control assistive systems for patients with severe disabilities. Recently, we have presented a novel BCI approach that combines an electrotactile menu and a brain switch, which allows the user to trigger many commands robustly and efficiently. However, the commands are timed to periodic tactile cues and this may challenge online control. In the present study, therefore, we implemented and evaluated a novel approach for online closed-loop control using the proposed BCI. Eleven healthy subjects used the novel method to move a cursor in a 2D space. To assure robust control with properly timed commands, the BCI was integrated within a state machine allowing the subject to start the cursor movement in the selected direction and asynchronously stop the cursor. The brain switch was controlled using motor execution (ME) or imagery (MI) and the menu implemented four (straight movements) or eight commands (straight and diagonal movements). The results showed a high completion rate of a target hitting task (~97% and ~92% for ME and MI, respectively), with a small number of collisions, when four-channel control was used. There was no significant difference in outcome measures between MI and ME, and performance was similar for four and eight commands. These results demonstrate that the novel state-based scheme driven by a robust BCI can be successfully utilized for online control. Therefore, it can be an attractive solution for providing the user an online-control interface with many commands, which is difficult to achieve using classic BCI solutions."
31071048,"Motor imagery electroencephalography (EEG) decoding is an essential part of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) which help motor-disabled patients to communicate with the outside world by external devices. Recently, deep learning algorithms using decomposed spectrums of EEG as inputs may omit important spatial dependencies and different temporal scale information, thus generated the poor decoding performance. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end EEG decoding framework, which employs raw multi-channel EEG as inputs, to boost decoding accuracy by the channel-projection mixed-scale convolutional neural network (CP-MixedNet) aided by amplitude-perturbation data augmentation. Specifically, the first block in CP-MixedNet is designed to learn primary spatial and temporal representations from EEG signals. The mixed-scale convolutional block is then used to capture mixed-scale temporal information, which effectively reduces the number of training parameters when expanding reception fields of the network. Finally, based on the features extracted in previous blocks, the classification block is constructed to classify EEG tasks. The experiments are implemented on two public EEG datasets (BCI competition IV 2a and High gamma dataset) to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The competitive results demonstrate that our proposed method is a promising solution to improve the decoding performance of motor imagery BCIs."
31062175,"Mental tasks classification such as motor imagery, based on EEG signals is an important problem in brain computer interface systems (BCI). One of the major concerns in BCI is to have a high classification accuracy. The other concerning one is with the favorable result is guaranteed how to improve the computational efficiency. In this paper, Mu/Beta rhythm was obtained by bandpass filter from EEG signal. And the classical linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used for deciding which rhythm can give the better classification performance. During this, the common spatial pattern (CSP) was used to project data subject to the ratio of projected energy of one class to that of the other class was maximized. The optimal projection dimension was determined corresponding to the maximum of area under the curve (AUC) for each participant. Eventually, regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) is possible to decode the imagined motor sensed using electroencephalogram (EEG). Results show that higher classification accuracy can be provided by RLDA. And optimal projection dimensions determined by LDA and RLDA are of consistent solution, this improves computational efficiency of CSP-RLDA method without computation of projection dimension."
31057380,"Electroencephalography based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) show promise of providing an alternative communication channel between the brain and an external device. It is well acknowledged that BCI control is a skill and could be improved through practice and training. In this study, we explore the change of BCI behavioral performance as well as the electrophysiological properties across three training sessions in a pool of 42 human subjects. Our results show that the group average of BCI accuracy and the information transfer rate improved significantly in the third session compared to the first session; especially the significance reached in a smaller subset of a low BCI performance group (average accuracy <70%) as well. There was a significant difference of event-related desynchronization (ERD) lateralization for BCI control between the left- and right-hand imagination task in the last two sessions, but this significant difference was not revealed in the first training sessions. No significant change of <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> value or event-related desynchronization and synchronization (ERD/ERS) for either channel C3 or channel C4, which were used for online control, was found across the training sessions. The change of ERD lateralization was also not significant across the training sessions. The present results indicate that BCI training could induce a change of behavioral performance and electrophysiological properties quickly, within just a few hours of training, distributed into three sessions. Multiple training sessions might especially be beneficial for the low BCI performers."
31049051,"Feature extraction of motor imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) has shown good application prospects in the field of medical health. Also, multivariate entropy-based feature extraction methods have been gradually applied to analyze complex multichannel biomedical signals, such as EEG and electromyography. Compared with traditional multivariate entropies, refined composite multivariate multiscale fuzzy entropy (RCmvMFE) overcomes the defect of unstable entropy values caused by the scale factor increase and is beneficial towards obtaining richer feature information. However, the coarse-grained process of RCmvMFE is mean filtered, which weakens Gaussian noise and is powerless against random impulse noise interference. This yields poor quality feature information and low accuracy classification. In this paper, RCmvMFE is improved (IRCmvMFE) by using composite filters in the coarse-grained procedure to enhance filter performance. Median filters are employed to remove the impulse noise interference from multichannel MI-EEG signals, and these filtered MI-EEGs are further smoothed by the mean filters. The multiscale IRCmvMFEs are calculated for all channels of composite filtered MI-EEGs, forming a feature vector, and a support vector machine is used for pattern classification. Based on two public datasets with different motor imagery tasks, the recognition results of 10 × 10-fold cross-validation achieved 99.43% and 99.86%, respectively, and the statistical analysis of experimental results was completed, showing the effectiveness of IRCmvMFE, as well. The proposed IRCmvMFE-based feature extraction method is superior compared to entropy-based and traditional methods."
31034407,"This paper targets a major challenge in developing practical electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs): how to cope with individual differences so that better learning performance can be obtained for a new subject, with minimum or even no subject-specific data? We propose a novel approach to align EEG trials from different subjects in the Euclidean space to make them more similar, and hence improve the learning performance for a new subject. Our approach has three desirable properties: first, it aligns the EEG trials directly in the Euclidean space, and any signal processing, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms can then be applied to the aligned trials; second, its computational cost is very low; and third, it is unsupervised and does not need any label information from the new subject. Both offline and simulated online experiments on motor imagery classification and event-related potential classification verified that our proposed approach outperformed a state-of-the-art Riemannian space data alignment approach, and several approaches without data alignment. The proposed Euclidean space EEG data alignment approach can greatly facilitate transfer learning in BCIs. Our proposed approach is effective, efficient, and easy to implement. It could be an essential pre-processing step for EEG-based BCIs."
31021801,"Accurate classification of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals plays an important role in diagnoses of different type of mental activities. One of the most important challenges, associated with classification of EEG signals is how to design an efficient classifier consisting of strong generalization capability. Aiming to improve the classification performance, in this paper, we propose a novel multiclass support matrix machine (M-SMM) from the perspective of maximizing the inter-class margins. The objective function is a combination of binary hinge loss that works on C matrices and spectral elastic net penalty as regularization term. This regularization term is a combination of Frobenius and nuclear norm, which promotes structural sparsity and shares similar sparsity patterns across multiple predictors. It also maximizes the inter-class margin that helps to deal with complex high dimensional noisy data. The extensive experiment results supported by theoretical analysis and statistical tests show the effectiveness of the M-SMM for solving the problem of classifying EEG signals associated with motor imagery in brain-computer interface applications."
30990183,"In brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), the typical models of the EEG observations usually lead to a poor estimation of the trial covariance matrices, given the high non-stationarity of the EEG sources. We propose the application of two techniques that significantly improve the accuracy of these estimations and can be combined with a wide range of motor imagery BCI (MI-BCI) methods. The first one scales the observations in such a way that implicitly normalizes the common temporal strength of the source activities. When the scaling applies independently to the trials of the observations, the procedure justifies and improves the classical preprocessing for the EEG data. In addition, when the scaling is instantaneous and independent for each sample, the procedure particularizes to Tyler's method in statistics for obtaining a distribution-free estimate of scattering. In this case, the proposal provides an original interpretation of this existing method as a technique that pursuits an implicit instantaneous power-normalization of the underlying source processes. The second technique applies to the classifier and improves its performance through a convenient regularization of the features covariance matrix. Experimental tests reveal that a combination of the proposed techniques with the state-of-the-art algorithms for motor-imagery classification provides a significant improvement in the classification results."
30985403,"Motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interfaces could be used clinically to trigger neurological recovery and improve motor function for patients with neural injuries. However, the factors that impact on MI performance and rehabilitative effect of MI-based brain-computer interfaces have not been characterized. According to our previous study, complex imagery tasks with dynamic visual paradigm could induce stronger MI features and obtain significantly higher average classification accuracy than nondynamic guidance. This study attempted to further investigate intracortical activities under different instructive paradigms and explore their potential effects on motor recovery. Eleven participants performed four types of different paradigms, including a nondynamic visual paradigm with simple MI task and three other dynamic visual/audiovisual paradigms with simple/complex MI tasks. A 64-channel electroencephalography was acquired and a voxel by voxel grand average of cortical source activities with statistical nonparametric mapping based on standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography were performed for comparisons among these paradigms in both alpha and beta bands. Moreover, seven regions of interest were selected to further analyze mean current source density variations for each paradigm with statistical analysis between dynamic and nondynamic paradigms. The outcomes uncovered that the dynamic visual aided paradigm with complex imagery tasks stimulated stronger cortical activities in core motor-related regions and triggered more extensive activation in the classical frontoparietal mirror regions than nondynamic paradigm. Involvement of these areas had a positive impact on the recovery of motor deficits in patients with neural injuries."
30983986,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology shows potential for application to motor rehabilitation therapies that use neural plasticity to restore motor function and improve quality of life of stroke survivors. However, it is often difficult for BCI systems to provide the variety of control commands necessary for multi-task real-time control of soft robot naturally. In this study, a novel multimodal human-machine interface system (mHMI) is developed using combinations of electrooculography (EOG), electroencephalography (EEG), and electromyogram (EMG) to generate numerous control instructions. Moreover, we also explore subject acceptance of an affordable wearable soft robot to move basic hand actions during robot-assisted movement. Six healthy subjects separately perform left and right hand motor imagery, looking-left and looking-right eye movements, and different hand gestures in different modes to control a soft robot in a variety of actions. The results indicate that the number of mHMI control instructions is significantly greater than achievable with any individual mode. Furthermore, the mHMI can achieve an average classification accuracy of 93.83% with the average information transfer rate of 47.41 bits/min, which is entirely equivalent to a control speed of 17 actions per minute. The study is expected to construct a more user-friendly mHMI for real-time control of soft robot to help healthy or disabled persons perform basic hand movements in friendly and convenient way."
30978978,"Single-trial motor imagery classification is a crucial aspect of brain-computer applications. Therefore, it is necessary to extract and discriminate signal features involving motor imagery movements. Riemannian geometry-based feature extraction methods are effective when designing these types of motor-imagery-based brain-computer interface applications. In the field of information theory, Riemannian geometry is mainly used with covariance matrices. Accordingly, investigations showed that if the method is used after the execution of the filterbank approach, the covariance matrix preserves the frequency and spatial information of the signal. Deep-learning methods are superior when the data availability is abundant and while there is a large number of features. The purpose of this study is to a) show how to use a single deep-learning-based classifier in conjunction with BCI (brain-computer interface) applications with the CSP (common spatial features) and the Riemannian geometry feature extraction methods in BCI applications and to b) describe one of the wrapper feature-selection algorithms, referred to as the particle swarm optimization, in combination with a decision tree algorithm. In this work, the CSP method was used for a multiclass case by using only one classifier. Additionally, a combination of power spectrum density features with covariance matrices mapped onto the tangent space of a Riemannian manifold was used. Furthermore, the particle swarm optimization method was implied to ease the training by penalizing bad features, and the moving windows method was used for augmentation. After empirical study, the convolutional neural network was adopted to classify the pre-processed data. Our proposed method improved the classification accuracy for several subjects that comprised the well-known BCI competition IV 2a dataset."
30951847,"Volitional modulation and neurofeedback of sensorimotor oscillatory activity is currently being evaluated as a strategy to facilitate motor restoration following stroke. Knowledge on the interplay between this regional brain self-regulation, distributed network entrainment and handedness is, however, limited. In a randomized cross-over design, twenty-one healthy subjects (twelve right-handers [RH], nine left-handers [LH]) performed kinesthetic motor imagery of left (48 trials) and right finger extension (48 trials). A brain-machine interface turned event-related desynchronization in the beta frequency-band (16-22 Hz) during motor imagery into passive hand opening by a robotic orthosis. Thereby, every participant subsequently activated either the dominant (DH) or non-dominant hemisphere (NDH) to control contralateral hand opening. The task-related cortical networks were studied with electroencephalography. The magnitude of the induced oscillatory modulation range in the sensorimotor cortex was independent of both handedness (RH, LH) and hemispheric specialization (DH, NDH). However, the regional beta-band modulation was associated with different alpha-band networks in RH and LH: RH presented a stronger inter-hemispheric connectivity, while LH revealed a stronger intra-hemispheric interaction. Notably, these distinct network entrainments were independent of hemispheric specialization. In healthy subjects, sensorimotor beta-band activity can be robustly modulated by motor imagery and proprioceptive feedback in both hemispheres independent of handedness. However, right and left handers show different oscillatory entrainment of cortical alpha-band networks during neurofeedback. This finding may inform neurofeedback interventions in future to align them more precisely with the underlying physiology."
30946880,"Recently, hybrid brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) combining more than one modality have been investigated with the aim of boosting the performance of the existing single-modal BCIs in terms of accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR). Previously, we introduced a novel hybrid BCI in which EEG and fTCD modalities are used simultaneously to measure electrical brain activity and cerebral blood velocity during motor imagery (MI) tasks. In this paper, we used multi-scale analysis and common spatial pattern algorithm to extract EEG and fTCD features. Moreover, we proposed probabilistic fusion of EEG and fTCD evidences instead of concatenating EEG and fTCD feature vectors corresponding to each trial. A Bayesian approach was proposed to fuse EEG and fTCD evidences under 3 different assumptions. Experimental results showed that 93.85%, 93.71%, and 100% average accuracies and 19.89, 26.55, and 40.83 bits/min average ITRs were achieved for right MI vs baseline, left MI versus baseline, and right MI versus left MI respectively. These performance measures outperformed the results we obtained before in our preliminary study in which average accuracies of 88.33%, 89.48%, and 82.38% and average ITRs of 4.17, 5.45, and 10.57 bits/min were achieved for right MI versus baseline, left MI versus baseline, and right MI versus left MI respectively. Moreover, in terms of both accuracy and speed, the EEG- fTCD BCI with the proposed analysis techniques outperformed all EEG- fNIRS studies in comparison. The proposed system is a more accurate and faster alternative to EEG-fNIRS systems."
30932828,"A variety of pattern analysis techniques for model training in brain interfaces exploit neural feature dimensionality reduction based on feature ranking and selection heuristics. In the light of broad evidence demonstrating the potential sub-optimality of ranking-based feature selection by any criterion, we propose to extend this focus with an information theoretic learning-driven feature transformation concept. We present a maximum mutual information linear transformation and a nonlinear transformation framework derived by a general definition of the feature transformation learning problem. Empirical assessments are performed based on electroencephalographic data recorded during a four class motor imagery brain-computer interface (BCI) task. Exploiting the state-of-the-art methods for initial feature vector construction, we compare the proposed approaches with conventional feature selection-based dimensionality reduction techniques, which are widely used in brain interfaces. Furthermore, for the multi-class problem, we present and exploit a hierarchical graphical model-based BCI decoding system. Both binary and multi-class decoding analyses demonstrate significantly better performances with the proposed methods. Information theoretic feature transformations are capable of tackling potential confounders of conventional approaches in various settings. We argue that this concept provides significant insights to extend the focus on feature selection heuristics to a broader definition of feature transformation learning in brain interfaces."
30910728,"Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) enables the update of various brain-activity measures during an ongoing experiment as soon as a new brain volume is acquired. However, the recorded Blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal also contains physiological artifacts such as breathing and heartbeat, which potentially cause misleading false positive effects especially problematic in brain-computer interface (BCI) and neurofeedback (NF) setups. The low temporal resolution of echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences (which is in the range of seconds) prevents a proper separation of these artifacts from the BOLD signal. MR-Encephalography (MREG) has been shown to provide the high temporal resolution required to unalias and correct for physiological fluctuations and leads to increased specificity and sensitivity for mapping task-based activation and functional connectivity as well as for detecting dynamic changes in connectivity over time. By comparing a simultaneous multislice echo planar imaging (SMS-EPI) sequence and an MREG sequence using the same nominal spatial resolution in an offline analysis for three different experimental fMRI paradigms (perception of house and face stimuli, motor imagery, Stroop task), the potential of this novel technique for future BCI and NF applications was investigated. First, adapted general linear model pre-whitening which accounts for the high temporal resolution in MREG was implemented to calculate proper statistical results and be able to compare these with the SMS-EPI sequence. Furthermore, the respiration- and cardiac pulsation-related signals were successfully separated from the MREG signal using independent component analysis which were then included as regressors for a GLM analysis. Only the MREG sequence allowed to clearly separate cardiac pulsation and respiration components from the signal time course. It could be shown that these components highly correlate with the recorded respiration and cardiac pulsation signals using a respiratory belt and fingertip pulse plethysmograph. Temporal signal-to-noise ratios of SMS-EPI and MREG were comparable. Functional connectivity analysis using partial correlation showed a reduced standard error in MREG compared to SMS-EPI. Also, direct time course comparisons by down-sampling the MREG signal to the SMS-EPI temporal resolution showed lower variance in MREG. In general, we show that the higher temporal resolution is beneficial for fMRI time course modeling and this aspect can be exploited in offline application but also, is especially attractive, for real-time BCI and NF applications."

30883278,"Practical motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) data-based applications are limited by the waste of unlabeled samples in supervised learning and excessive time consumption in the pretraining period. A semisupervised deep stacking network with an adaptive learning rate strategy (SADSN) is proposed to solve the sample loss caused by supervised learning of EEG data and the extraction of manual features. The SADSN adopts the idea of an adaptive learning rate into a contrastive divergence (CD) algorithm to accelerate its convergence. Prior knowledge is introduced into the intermediary layer of the deep stacking network, and a restricted Boltzmann machine is trained by a semisupervised method in which the adjusting scope of the coefficient in learning rate is determined by performance analysis. Several EEG data sets are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that the recognition accuracy of SADSN is advanced with a more significant convergence rate and successfully classifies motor imagery."
30856388,"Electroencephalography (EEG) is a powerful, noninvasive tool that provides a high temporal resolution to directly reflect brain activities. Conventional electrodes require skin preparation and the use of conductive gels, while subjects must wear uncomfortable EEG hats. These procedures usually create a challenge for subjects. In the present study, we propose a portable EEG signal acquisition system. This study consists of two main parts: 1) A novel, portable dry-electrode and wireless brain-computer interface is designed. The EEG signal acquisition board is based on 24 bit, analog-to-digital converters chip and wireless microprocessor unit. The wireless portable brain computer interface device acquires an EEG signal comfortably, and the EEG signals are transmitted to a personal computer via Bluetooth. 2) A convolutional neural network (CNN) classification algorithm is implemented to classify the motor imagery (MI) experiment using novel feature 3-dimension input. The time dimension was reshaped to represent the first and second dimension, and the frequency band was used as the third dimension. Specifically, frequency domain representations of EEG signals obtained via wavelet package decomposition (WPD) are obtained to train CNN. The classification performance in terms of the value of kappa is 0.564 for the proposed method. The t-test results show that the performance improvement of CNN over other selected state-of-the-art methods is statistically significant. Our results show that the proposed design is reliable in measuring EEG signals, and the 3D CNN provides better classification performance than other method for MI experiments."
30843846,"Motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) controlling functional electrical stimulation (FES) is promising for disabled patients to restore their motor functions. However, it remains unclear how much the BCI part can contribute to the functional coupling between the brain and muscle. Specifically, whether it can enhance the cerebral activation for motor training? Here, we investigate the electroencephalographic and cerebral hemodynamic responses for MI-BCI-FES training and MI-FES training, respectively. Twelve healthy subjects were recruited in the motor training study when concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) were recorded. Compared with the MI-FES training conditions, the MI-BCI-FES could induce significantly stronger event-related desynchronization (ERD) and blood oxygen response, which demonstrates that BCI indeed plays a functional role in the closed-loop motor training. Therefore, this paper verifies the feasibility of using BCI to train motor functions in a closed-loop manner."
30840712,"This paper proposes a novel adaptive online-feedback methodology for Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). The method uses ElectroEncephaloGraphic (EEG) signals and combines motor with speech imagery to allow for tasks that involve multiple degrees of freedom (DoF). The main approach utilizes the covariance matrix descriptor as feature, and the Relevance Vector Machines (RVM) classifier. The novel contributions include, (1) a new method to select representative data to update the RVM model, and (2) an online classifier which is an adaptively-weighted mixture of RVM models to account for the users' exploration and exploitation processes during the learning phase. Instead of evaluating the subjects' performance solely based on the conventional metric of accuracy, we analyze their skill's improvement based on 3 other criteria, namely the confusion matrix's quality, the separability of the data, and their instability. After collecting calibration data for 8 minutes in the first run, 8 participants were able to control the system while receiving visual feedback in the subsequent runs. We observed significant improvement in all subjects, including two of them who fell into the BCI illiteracy category. Our proposed BCI system complements the existing approaches in several aspects. First, the co-adaptation paradigm not only adapts the classifiers, but also allows the users to actively discover their own way to use the BCI through their exploration and exploitation processes. Furthermore, the auto-calibrating system can be used immediately with a minimal calibration time. Finally, this is the first work to combine motor and speech imagery in an online feedback experiment to provide multiple DoF for BCI control applications."
30808014,"Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis has been an important tool in neuroscience with applications in neuroscience, neural engineering (e.g. Brain-computer interfaces, BCI's), and even commercial applications. Many of the analytical tools used in EEG studies have used machine learning to uncover relevant information for neural classification and neuroimaging. Recently, the availability of large EEG data sets and advances in machine learning have both led to the deployment of deep learning architectures, especially in the analysis of EEG signals and in understanding the information it may contain for brain functionality. The robust automatic classification of these signals is an important step towards making the use of EEG more practical in many applications and less reliant on trained professionals. Towards this goal, a systematic review of the literature on deep learning applications to EEG classification was performed to address the following critical questions: (1) Which EEG classification tasks have been explored with deep learning? (2) What input formulations have been used for training the deep networks? (3) Are there specific deep learning network structures suitable for specific types of tasks? A systematic literature review of EEG classification using deep learning was performed on Web of Science and PubMed databases, resulting in 90 identified studies. Those studies were analyzed based on type of task, EEG preprocessing methods, input type, and deep learning architecture. For EEG classification tasks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, deep belief networks outperform stacked auto-encoders and multi-layer perceptron neural networks in classification accuracy. The tasks that used deep learning fell into five general groups: emotion recognition, motor imagery, mental workload, seizure detection, event related potential detection, and sleep scoring. For each type of task, we describe the specific input formulation, major characteristics, and end classifier recommendations found through this review. This review summarizes the current practices and performance outcomes in the use of deep learning for EEG classification. Practical suggestions on the selection of many hyperparameters are provided in the hope that they will promote or guide the deployment of deep learning to EEG datasets in future research."
30804988,"This paper proposes a novel classification framework and a novel data reduction method to distinguish multiclass motor imagery (MI) electroencephalography (EEG) for brain computer interface (BCI) based on the manifold of covariance matrices in a Riemannian perspective. For method 1, a subject-specific decision tree (SSDT) framework with filter geodesic minimum distance to Riemannian mean (FGMDRM) is designed to identify MI tasks and reduce the classification error in the nonseparable region of FGMDRM. Method 2 includes a feature extraction algorithm and a classification algorithm. The feature extraction algorithm combines semisupervised joint mutual information (<i>semi</i>-JMI) with general discriminate analysis (GDA), namely, SJGDA, to reduce the dimension of vectors in the Riemannian tangent plane. And the classification algorithm replaces the FGMDRM in method 1 with k-nearest neighbor (KNN), named SSDT-KNN. By applying method 2 on BCI competition IV dataset 2a, the kappa value has been improved from 0.57 to 0.607 compared to the winner of dataset 2a. And method 2 also obtains high recognition rate on the other two datasets."
30802693,"In motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interface (BCI) signal analysis, mu and beta rhythms of electroencephalograms (EEGs) are widely investigated due to their high temporal resolution and capability to define the different movement-related mental tasks separately. However, due to the high dimensions and subject-specific behaviour of EEG features, there is a need for a suitable feature selection algorithm that can select the optimal features to give the best classification performance along with increased computational efficiency. The present study proposes a feature selection algorithm based on neighbourhood component analysis (NCA) with modification of the regularization parameter. In the experiment, time, frequency, and phase features of the EEG are extracted using a dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). Afterwards, the proposed algorithm selects the most significant EEG features, and using these selected features, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier performs the classification of MI signals. The proposed algorithm has been validated experimentally on two public BCI datasets (BCI Competition II Dataset III and BCI Competition IV Dataset 2b). The classification performance of the algorithm is quantified by the average accuracy and kappa coefficient, whose values are 80.7% and 0.615 respectively. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with standard feature selection methods based on Genetic Algorithm (GA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and ReliefF and performs better than these methods. Further, the proposed algorithm selects the lowest number of features and results in increased computational efficiency, which makes it a promising feature selection tool for an MI-based BCI system."
30786265,"The aim of this study is to propose a recognition system of pedaling motor imagery for lower-limb rehabilitation, which uses unsupervised methods to improve the feature extraction, and consequently the class discrimination of EEG patterns. After applying a spectrogram based on short-time Fourier transform (SSTFT), both sparseness constraints and total power are used on the time-frequency representation to automatically locate the subject-specific bands that pack the highest power during pedaling motor imagery. The output frequency bands are employed in the recognition system to automatically adjust the cut-off frequency of a low-pass filter (Butterworth, 2nd order). Riemannian geometry is also used to extract spatial features, which are further analyzed through a fast version of neighborhood component analysis to increase the class separability. For ten healthy subjects, our recognition system based on subject-specific bands achieved mean accuracy of [Formula: see text] and mean Kappa of [Formula: see text]. Our approach can be used to obtain a low-cost robotic rehabilitation system based on motorized pedal, as pedaling exercises have shown great potential for improving the muscular performance of post-stroke survivors."
30744661,"While spontaneous robotic arm control using motor imagery has been reported, most previous successful cases have used invasive approaches with advantages in spatial resolution. However, still many researchers continue to investigate methods for robotic arm control with noninvasive neural signal. Most of noninvasive control of robotic arm utilizes P300, steady state visually evoked potential, N2pc, and mental tasks differentiation. Even though these approaches demonstrated successful accuracy, they are limited in time efficiency and user intuition, and mostly require visual stimulation. Ultimately, velocity vector construction using electroencephalography activated by motion-related motor imagery can be considered as a substitution. In this study, a vision-aided brain-machine interface training system for robotic arm control is proposed and developed. The proposed system uses a Microsoft Kinect to detect and estimates the 3D positions of the possible target objects. The predicted velocity vector for robot arm input is compensated using the artificial potential to follow an intended one among the possible targets. Two participants with cervical spinal cord injury trained with the system to explore its possible effects. In a situation with four possible targets, the proposed system significantly improved the distance error to the intended target compared to the unintended ones (p < 0.0001). Functional magnetic resonance imaging after five sessions of observation-based training with the developed system showed brain activation patterns with tendency of focusing to ipsilateral primary motor and sensory cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and contralateral cerebellum. However, shared control with blending parameter α less than 1 was not successful and success rate for touching an instructed target was less than the chance level (= 50%). The pilot clinical study utilizing the training system suggested potential beneficial effects in characterizing the brain activation patterns."
30737625,"Improper selection of the number and the amplitude of noise channels in noise-assisted multivariate empirical mode decomposition (NA-MEMD) would induce mode mixing and leakage in the obtained intrinsic mode functions (IMF), which would degrade the performance in applications like brain-computer interface (BCI) systems based on motor imagery. A measurement (ML-index) using no prior knowledge of the underlying components of the original signals was proposed to quantify the amount of mode mixing and leakage of IMFs. Both synthetic signals and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from motor imagery experiments were used to test the validity. The BCI classification performance using NA-MEMD with the optimal parameters selected based on the ML-index was compared with the performance under the non-optimal parameter condition and the performance using the conventional filtering method. Test on synthetic signals demonstrated the ML-index can effectively quantify the amount of mode mixing and leakage, and help to improve the accuracy of extracting the underlying components. Test on EEG recordings showed the BCI classification performance can be significantly improved under the optimal parameter condition. This study provided a method to quantify the amount of mode mixing and leakage in IMFs and realized the optimization of the parameters associated with noise channels in NA-MEMD. Graphical abstract One of the synthetic multivariate signals comprised four components oscillating at different rates (middle column). Noise-assisted multivariate empirical mode decomposition (noise-assisted MEMD) was used to extract different components. Mode mixing issue occurred under the non-optimal parameter condition (left column). The issue was alleviated under the optimal parameter condition (right column) which can be obtained with the proposed method in this study."
30728772,"Predicting a subject's ability to use a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is one of the major issues in the BCI domain. Relevant applications of forecasting BCI performance include the ability to adapt the BCI to the needs and expectations of the user, assessing the efficiency of BCI use in stroke rehabilitation, and finally, homogenizing a research population. A limited number of recent studies have proposed the use of subjective questionnaires, such as the Motor Imagery Questionnaire Revised-Second Edition (MIQ-RS). However, further research is necessary to confirm the effectiveness of this type of subjective questionnaire as a BCI performance estimation tool. In this study we aim to answer the following questions: can the MIQ-RS be used to estimate the performance of an MI-based BCI? If not, can we identify different markers that could be used as performance estimators? To answer these questions, we recorded EEG signals from 35 healthy volunteers during BCI use. The subjects had previously completed the MIQ-RS questionnaire. We conducted an offline analysis to assess the correlation between the questionnaire scores related to Kinesthetic and Motor imagery tasks and the performances of four classification methods. Our results showed no significant correlation between BCI performance and the MIQ-RS scores. However, we reveal that BCI performance is correlated to habits and frequency of practicing manual activities."
30718518,"Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) provide a promising information channel between the biological brain and external devices and are applied in building brain-to-device control. Prior studies have explored the feasibility of establishing a brain-brain interface (BBI) across various brains via the combination of BMIs. However, using BBI to realize the efficient multidegree control of a living creature, such as a rat, to complete a navigation task in a complex environment has yet to be shown. In this study, we developed a BBI from the human brain to a rat implanted with microelectrodes (i.e., rat cyborg), which integrated electroencephalogram-based motor imagery and brain stimulation to realize human mind control of the rat's continuous locomotion. Control instructions were transferred from continuous motor imagery decoding results with the proposed control models and were wirelessly sent to the rat cyborg through brain micro-electrical stimulation. The results showed that rat cyborgs could be smoothly and successfully navigated by the human mind to complete a navigation task in a complex maze. Our experiments indicated that the cooperation through transmitting multidimensional information between two brains by computer-assisted BBI is promising."
30703032,"Brain-computer interfaces based on motor imagery (MI) have been widely used to support the rehabilitation of motor functions of the upper limbs rather than lower limbs. This is probably because it is more difficult to detect the brain activities of lower limb MI. In order to reliably detect the brain activities of lower limbs to restore or improve the walking ability of the disabled, we propose a new paradigm of walking imagery (WI) in a virtual environment (VE), in order to elicit the reliable brain activities and achieve a significant training effect. First, we extract and fuse both the spatial and time-frequency features as a multi-view feature to represent the patterns in the brain activity. Second, we design a multi-view multi-level deep polynomial network (MMDPN) to explore the complementarity among the features so as to improve the detection of walking from an idle state. Our extensive experimental results show that the VE-based paradigm significantly performs better than the traditional text-based paradigm. In addition, the VE-based paradigm can effectively help users to modulate the brain activities and improve the quality of electroencephalography signals. We also observe that the MMDPN outperforms other deep learning methods in terms of classification performance."
30703031,"Enhancing motor imagery (MI) results in amplified event-related desynchronization (ERD) and is important for MI-based rehabilitation and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Many attempts to enhance the MI by providing a visual guidance have been reported. We believe that the rubber hand illusion (RHI), which induces body ownership over an external object, can provide better guidance to enhance MI; thus, an RHI-based paradigm with motorized moving rubber hand was proposed. To validate the proposed MI enhancing paradigm, we conducted an experimental comparison among paradigms with 20 healthy subjects. The peak amplitude and arrival times of ERD were compared at contralateral and ipsilateral electroencephalogram channels. We found significantly amplified ERD caused by the proposed paradigm, which is similar to the ERD caused by motor execution. In addition, the arrival time suggests that the proposed paradigm is applicable for BCI. In conclusion, the proposed paradigm can significantly enhance the MI with better characteristics for use with BCI."
30700310,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have demonstrated the potential to provide paralyzed individuals with new means of communication, but an electroencephalography (EEG)-based endogenous BCI has never been successfully used for communication with a patient in a completely locked-in state (CLIS). In this study, we investigated the possibility of using an EEG-based endogenous BCI paradigm for online binary communication by a patient in CLIS. A female patient in CLIS participated in this study. She had not communicated even with her family for more than one year with complete loss of motor function. Offline and online experiments were conducted to validate the feasibility of the proposed BCI system. In the offline experiment, we determined the best combination of mental tasks and the optimal classification strategy leading to the best performance. In the online experiment, we investigated whether our BCI system could be potentially used for real-time communication with the patient. An online classification accuracy of 87.5% was achieved when Riemannian geometry-based classification was applied to real-time EEG data recorded while the patient was performing one of two mental-imagery tasks for 5 s. Our results suggest that an EEG-based endogenous BCI has the potential to be used for online communication with a patient in CLIS."
30699946,"Successful applications of brain-computer interface (BCI) approaches to motor imagery (MI) are still limited. In this paper, we propose a classification framework for MI electroencephalogram (EEG) signals that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with a variational autoencoder (VAE) for classification. The decoder of the VAE generates a Gaussian distribution, so it can be used to fit the Gaussian distribution of EEG signals. A new representation of input was developed by combining the time, frequency, and channel information from the EEG signal, and the CNN-VAE method was designed and optimized accordingly for this form of input. In this network, the classification of the extracted CNN features is performed via the deep network VAE. Our framework, with an average kappa value of 0.564, outperforms the best classification method in the literature for BCI Competition IV dataset 2b with a 3% improvement. Furthermore, using our own dataset, the CNN-VAE framework also yields the best performance for both three-electrode and five-electrode EEGs and achieves the best average kappa values 0.568 and 0.603, respectively. Our results show that the proposed CNN-VAE method raises performance to the current state of the art."
30699389,"A motor-imagery-based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) provides an alternative way for people to interface with the outside world. However, the classification accuracy of MI signals remains challenging, especially with an increased number of classes and the presence of high variations with data from multiple individual people. This work investigates electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing techniques, aiming to enhance the classification performance of multiple MI tasks in terms of tackling the challenges caused by the vast variety of subjects. This work introduces a novel method to extract discriminative features by combining the features of functional brain networks with two other feature extraction algorithms: common spatial pattern (CSP) and local characteristic-scale decomposition (LCD). After functional brain networks are established from the MI EEG signals of the subjects, the measures of degree in the binary networks are extracted as additional features and fused with features in the frequency and spatial domains extracted by the CSP and LCD algorithms. A real-time BCI robot control system is designed and implemented with the proposed method. Subjects can control the movement of the robot through four classes of MI tasks. Both the BCI competition IV dataset 2a and real-time data acquired in our designed system are used to validate the performance of the proposed method. As for the offline data experiment results, the average classification accuracy of the proposed method reaches 79.7%, outperforming the majority of popular algorithms. Experimental results with real-time data also prove the proposed method to be highly promising in its real-time performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method is robust in extracting discriminative brain activity features when performing different MI tasks, hence improving the classification accuracy in four-class MI tasks. The high classification accuracy and low computational demand show a considerable practicality for real-time rehabilitation systems."
30698704,"Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are mainly divided into three major paradigms: motor imagery (MI), event-related potential (ERP), and steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP). Here, we present a BCI dataset that includes the three major BCI paradigms with a large number of subjects over multiple sessions. In addition, information about the psychological and physiological conditions of BCI users was obtained using a questionnaire, and task-unrelated parameters such as resting state, artifacts, and electromyography of both arms were also recorded. We evaluated the decoding accuracies for the individual paradigms and determined performance variations across both subjects and sessions. Furthermore, we looked for more general, severe cases of BCI illiteracy than have been previously reported in the literature. Average decoding accuracies across all subjects and sessions were 71.1% (± 0.15), 96.7% (± 0.05), and 95.1% (± 0.09), and rates of BCI illiteracy were 53.7%, 11.1%, and 10.2% for MI, ERP, and SSVEP, respectively. Compared to the ERP and SSVEP paradigms, the MI paradigm exhibited large performance variations between both subjects and sessions. Furthermore, we found that 27.8% (15 out of 54) of users were universally BCI literate, i.e., they were able to proficiently perform all three paradigms. Interestingly, we found no universally illiterate BCI user, i.e., all participants were able to control at least one type of BCI system. Our EEG dataset can be utilized for a wide range of BCI-related research questions. All methods for the data analysis in this study are supported with fully open-source scripts that can aid in every step of BCI technology. Furthermore, our results support previous but disjointed findings on the phenomenon of BCI illiteracy."
30693612,"Effective use of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) typically requires training. Improved understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying BCI training will facilitate optimisation of BCIs. The current study examined the neural mechanisms related to training for electroencephalography (EEG)-based communication with an auditory event-related potential (ERP) BCI. Neural mechanisms of training in 10 healthy volunteers were assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an auditory ERP-based BCI task before (t1) and after (t5) three ERP-BCI training sessions outside the fMRI scanner (t2, t3, and t4). Attended stimuli were contrasted with ignored stimuli in the first-level fMRI data analysis (t1 and t5); the training effect was verified using the EEG data (t2-t4); and brain activation was contrasted before and after training in the second-level fMRI data analysis (t1 vs. t5). Training increased the communication speed from 2.9 bits/min (t2) to 4 bits/min (t4). Strong activation was found in the putamen, supplementary motor area (SMA), and superior temporal gyrus (STG) associated with attention to the stimuli. Training led to decreased activation in the superior frontal gyrus and stronger haemodynamic rebound in the STG and supramarginal gyrus. The neural mechanisms of ERP-BCI training indicate improved stimulus perception and reduced mental workload. The ERP task used in the current study showed overlapping activations with a motor imagery based BCI task from a previous study on the neural mechanisms of BCI training in the SMA and putamen. This suggests commonalities between the neural mechanisms of training for both BCI paradigms."
30682025,"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are inefficient for a non-negligible part of the population, estimated around 25%. To understand this phenomenon in Sensorimotor Rhythm (SMR) based BCIs, data from a large-scale screening study conducted on 80 novice participants with the Berlin BCI system and its standard machine-learning approach were investigated. Each participant performed one BCI session with resting state Encephalography, Motor Observation, Motor Execution and Motor Imagery recordings and 128 electrodes. A significant portion of the participants (40%) could not achieve BCI control (feedback performance > 70%). Based on the performance of the calibration and feedback runs, BCI users were stratified in three groups. Analyses directed to detect and elucidate the differences in the SMR activity of these groups were performed. Statistics on reactive frequencies, task prevalence and classification results are reported. Based on their SMR activity, also a systematic list of potential reasons leading to performance drops and thus hints for possible improvements of BCI experimental design are given. The categorization of BCI users has several advantages, allowing researchers 1) to select subjects for further analyses as well as for testing new BCI paradigms or algorithms, 2) to adopt a better subject-dependent training strategy and 3) easier comparisons between different studies."
30658523,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) based motor imagery brain⁻computer interface (BCI) requires large number of subject specific training trials to calibrate the system for a new subject. This results in long calibration time that limits the BCI usage in practice. One major challenge in the development of a brain⁻computer interface is to reduce calibration time or completely eliminate it. To address this problem, existing approaches use covariance matrices of electroencephalography (EEG) trials as descriptors for decoding BCI but do not consider the geometry of the covariance matrices, which lies in the space of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. This inevitably limits their performance. We focus on reducing calibration time by introducing SPD based classification approach. However, SPD-based classification has limited applicability in small training sets because the dimensionality of covariance matrices is large in proportion to the number of trials. To overcome this drawback, our paper proposes a new framework that transforms SPD matrices in lower dimension through spatial filter regularized by prior information of EEG channels. The efficacy of the proposed approach was validated on the small sample scenario through Dataset IVa from BCI Competition III. The proposed approach achieved mean accuracy of 86.13 % and mean kappa of 0.72 on Dataset IVa. The proposed method outperformed other approaches in existing studies on Dataset IVa. Finally, to ensure the robustness of the proposed method, we evaluated it on Dataset IIIa from BCI Competition III and Dataset IIa from BCI Competition IV. The proposed method achieved mean accuracy 92.22 % and 81.21 % on Dataset IIIa and Dataset IIa, respectively."
30634177,"The aim of this study was to introduce a novel methodology for classification of brain hemodynamic responses collected via functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during rest, motor imagery (MI) and motor execution (ME) tasks which involves generating population-level training sets. A 48-channel fNIRS system was utilized to obtain hemodynamic signals from the frontal (FC), primary motor (PMC) and somatosensory cortex (SMC) of ten subjects during an experimental paradigm consisting of MI and ME of various right hand movements. Classification accuracies of random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN) were computed at the single subject level by training each classifier with subject specific features, and at the group level by training with features from all subjects for ME versus Rest, MI versus Rest and MI versus ME conditions. The performances were also computed for channel data restricted to FC, PMC and SMC regions separately to determine optimal probe location. RF, SVM and ANN had comparably high classification accuracies for ME versus Rest (%94, %96 and %98 respectively) and for MI versus Rest (%95, %95 and %98 respectively) when fed with group level feature sets. The accuracy performance of each algorithm in localized brain regions were comparable (>%93) to the accuracy performance obtained with whole brain channels (>%94) for both ME versus Rest and MI versus Rest conditions. By demonstrating the feasibility of generating a population level training set with a high classification performance for three different classification algorithms, the findings pave the path for removing the necessity to acquire subject specific training data and hold promise for a novel, real-time fNIRS based BCI system design which will be most effective for application to disease populations for whom obtaining data to train a classification algorithm is not possible."
30626132,"Non-invasive, electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) on motor imagery movements translate the subject's motor intention into control signals through classifying the EEG patterns caused by different imagination tasks, e.g., hand movements. This type of BCI has been widely studied and used as an alternative mode of communication and environmental control for disabled patients, such as those suffering from a brainstem stroke or a spinal cord injury (SCI). Notwithstanding the success of traditional machine learning methods in classifying EEG signals, these methods still rely on hand-crafted features. The extraction of such features is a difficult task due to the high non-stationarity of EEG signals, which is a major cause by the stagnating progress in classification performance. Remarkable advances in deep learning methods allow end-to-end learning without any feature engineering, which could benefit BCI motor imagery applications. We developed three deep learning models: (1) A long short-term memory (LSTM); (2) a spectrogram-based convolutional neural network model (CNN); and (3) a recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN), for decoding motor imagery movements directly from raw EEG signals without (any manual) feature engineering. Results were evaluated on our own publicly available, EEG data collected from 20 subjects and on an existing dataset known as 2b EEG dataset from ""BCI Competition IV"". Overall, better classification performance was achieved with deep learning models compared to state-of-the art machine learning techniques, which could chart a route ahead for developing new robust techniques for EEG signal decoding. We underpin this point by demonstrating the successful real-time control of a robotic arm using our CNN based BCI."
30623892,"Motor imagery brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG), a promising technology to provide assistance and support rehabilitation of neurological patients with sensorimotor impairments, require a reliable and adaptable subject-specific model to efficiently decode motor intention. The most popular EEG feature extraction algorithm for MI-BCIs is the common spatial patterns (CSP) method, but its performance strongly depends on the predefined frequency band and time segment length for analyzing the EEG signal. In this work, a novel method for efficiently decoding motor intention for EEG-based BCIs performing multiple frequency band analysis in multiple EEG segments is presented. This decoding algorithm uses raw multichannel EEG data which are decomposed into specific [Formula: see text] temporal and [Formula: see text] frequency bands. Features are extracted at each [Formula: see text]-[Formula: see text] band by using CSP. Feature selection and classification are simultaneously performed by means of a fast procedure, based on elastic-net regression, which allows for the inclusion of a priori discriminative information into the model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested off-line on two public EEG-based MI-BCI datasets and on a self-acquired dataset in two configurations: multiple temporal windows and single temporal window. The experimental results show that the proposed multiple time-frequency band method yields overall accuracy improvements of up to [Formula: see text] (average accuracy of 84.8%) as compared to the best current state-of-the-art methods based on filter bank analysis and CSP for MI detection. Also, classification variability is reduced, making the proposed method more robust to intra-subject EEG fluctuations. This paper presents a novel approach for improving motor intention detection by automatically selecting subject-specific spatio-temporal-spectral features, especially when MI has to be detected against rest condition. This technique contributes to the further advancement and application of EEG-based MI-BCIs for assistance and neurorehabilitation therapy."
30619079,"The goal of the paper is to present an example of integrated analysis of electrical, hemodynamic, and motor activity accompanying the motor function recovery in a post-stroke patient having an extensive cortical lesion. The patient underwent a course of neurorehabilitation assisted with the hand exoskeleton controlled by brain-computer interface based on kinesthetic motor imagery. The BCI classifier was based on discriminating covariance matrices of EEG corresponding to motor imagery. The clinical data from three successive 2 weeks hospitalizations with 4 and 8 month intervals, respectively were under analysis. The rehabilitation outcome was measured by Fugl-Meyer scale and biomechanical analysis. Both measures indicate prominent improvement of the motor function of the paretic arm after each hospitalization. The analysis of brain activity resulted in three main findings. First, the sources of EEG activity in the intact brain areas, most specific to motor imagery, were similar to the patterns we observed earlier in both healthy subjects and post-stroke patients with mild subcortical lesions. Second, two sources of task-specific activity were localized in primary somatosensory areas near the lesion edge. The sources exhibit independent mu-rhythm activity with the peak frequency significantly lower than that of mu-rhythm in healthy subjects. The peculiarities of the detected source activity underlie changes in EEG covariance matrices during motor imagery, thus serving as the BCI biomarkers. Third, the fMRI data processing showed significant reduction in size of areas activated during the paretic hand movement imagery and increase for those activated during the intact hand movement imagery, shifting the activations to the same level. This might be regarded as the general index of the motor recovery. We conclude that the integrated analysis of EEG, fMRI, and motor activity allows to account for the reorganization of different levels of the motor system and to provide a comprehensive basis for adequate assessment of the BCI+ exoskeleton rehabilitation efficiency."
30609208,"Technologies such as brain-computer interfaces are able to guide mental practice, in particular motor imagery performance, to promote recovery in stroke patients, as a combined approach to conventional therapy. The aim of this systematic review was to provide a status report regarding advances in brain-computer interface, focusing in particular in upper limb motor recovery. The databases PubMed, Scopus, and PEDro were systematically searched for articles published between January 2010 and December 2017. The selected studies were randomized controlled trials involving brain-computer interface interventions in stroke patients, with upper limb assessment as primary outcome measures. Reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the trials, using the PEDro methodologic rating scale. From 309 titles, we included nine studies with high quality (PEDro ≥ 6). We found that the most common interface used was non-invasive electroencephalography, and the main neurofeedback, in stroke rehabilitation, was usually visual abstract or a combination with the control of an orthosis/robotic limb. Moreover, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale was a major outcome measure in eight out of nine studies. In addition, the benefits of functional electric stimulation associated to an interface were found in three studies. Neurofeedback training with brain-computer interface systems seem to promote clinical and neurophysiologic changes in stroke patients, in particular those with long-term efficacy."
33094110,"Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems infer brain signals recorded via EEG without using common neuromuscular pathways. User brain response to BCI error is a contributor to non-stationarity of the EEG signal and poses challenges in developing reliable active BCI control. Many passive BCI implementations, on the other hand, have the detection of error-related brain activity as their primary goal. Therefore, reliable detection of this signal is crucial in both active and passive BCIs. In this work, we propose CREST: a novel covariance-based method that uses Riemannian and Euclidean geometry and combines spatial and temporal aspects of the feedback-related brain activity in response to BCI error. We evaluate our proposed method with two datasets: an active BCI for 1-D cursor control using motor imagery and a passive BCI for 2-D cursor control. We show significant improvement across participants in both datasets compared to existing methods."
30590086,"Hybrid brain computer interfaces (BCIs) combining multiple brain imaging modalities have been proposed recently to boost the performance of single modality BCIs. In this paper, we propose a novel motor imagery (MI) hybrid BCI that uses electrical brain activity recorded using Electroencephalography (EEG) as well as cerebral blood flow velocity measured using functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound (fTCD). Features derived from the power spectrum for both EEG and fTCD signals were calculated. Mutual information and linear support vector machines (SVM) were employed for feature selection and classification. Using the EEG-fTCD combination, average accuracies of 88.33%, 89.48%, and 82.38% were achieved for right arm MI versus baseline, left arm MI versus baseline, and right arm MI versus left arm MI respectively. Compared to performance measures obtained using EEG only, the hybrid system provided significant improvement in terms of accuracy by 4.48%, 5.36%, and 4.76% respectively. In addition, average transmission rates of 4.17, 5.45, and 10.57 bits/min were achieved for right arm MI versus baseline, left arm MI versus baseline, and right arm MI versus left arm MI respectively. Compared to EEG-fNIRS hybrid BCIs in literature, we achieved similar or higher accuracies with shorter task duration. The proposed hybrid system is a promising candidate for real-time BCI applications."
30587046,"Modulation of sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) power, a rhythmic brain oscillation physiologically linked to motor imagery, is a popular Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) paradigm, but its interplay with slower cortical rhythms, also involved in movement preparation and cognitive processing, is not entirely understood. In this study, we evaluated the changes in phase and power of slow cortical activity in delta and theta bands, during a motor imagery task controlled by an SMR-based BMI system. In Experiment I, EEG of 20 right-handed healthy volunteers was recorded performing a motor-imagery task using an SMR-based BMI controlling a visual animation, and during task-free intervals. In Experiment II, 10 subjects were evaluated along five daily sessions, while BMI-controlling same visual animation, a buzzer, and a robotic hand exoskeleton. In both experiments, feedback received from the controlled device was proportional to SMR power (11-14 <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mspace></mspace></math> Hz) detected by a real-time EEG-based system. Synchronization of slow EEG frequencies along the trials was evaluated using inter-trial-phase coherence (ITPC). Results: cortical oscillations of EEG in delta and theta frequencies synchronized at the onset and at the end of both active and task-free trials; ITPC was significantly modulated by feedback sensory modality received during the tasks; and ITPC synchronization progressively increased along the training. These findings suggest that phase-locking of slow rhythms and resetting by sensory afferences might be a functionally relevant mechanism in cortical control of motor function. We propose that analysis of phase synchronization of slow cortical rhythms might also improve identification of temporal edges in BMI tasks and might help to develop physiological markers for identification of context task switching and practice-related changes in brain function, with potentially important implications for design and monitoring of motor imagery-based BMI systems, an emerging tool in neurorehabilitation of stroke."
30564961,"Word production begins with high-Gamma automatic linguistic processing functions followed by speech motor planning and articulation. Phonetic properties are processed in both linguistic and motor stages of word production. Four phonetically dissimilar phonemic structures ""BA"", ""FO"", ""LE"", and ""RY"" were chosen as covert speech tasks. Ten neurologically healthy volunteers with the age range of 21-33 participated in this experiment. Participants were asked to covertly speak a phonemic structure when they heard an auditory cue. EEG was recorded with 64 electrodes at 2048 samples/s. Initially, one-second trials were used, which contained linguistic and motor imagery activities. The four-class true positive rate was calculated. In the next stage, 312 ms trials were used to exclude covert articulation from analysis. By eliminating the covert articulation stage, the four-class grand average classification accuracy dropped from 96.4% to 94.5%. The most valuable features emerge after Auditory cue recognition (~100 ms post onset), and within the 70-128 Hz frequency range. The most significant identified brain regions were the Prefrontal Cortex (linked to stimulus driven executive control), Wernicke's area (linked to Phonological code retrieval), the right IFG, and Broca's area (linked to syllabification). Alpha and Beta band oscillations associated with motor imagery do not contain enough information to fully reflect the complexity of speech movements. Over 90% of the most class-dependent features were in the 30-128 Hz range, even during the covert articulation stage. As a result, compared to linguistic functions, the contribution of motor imagery of articulation in class separability of covert speech tasks from EEG data is negligible."
30523919,"Advances in brain science and computer technology in the past decade have led to exciting developments in brain-computer interface (BCI), thereby making BCI a top research area in applied science. The renaissance of BCI opens new methods of neurorehabilitation for physically disabled people (e.g. paralyzed patients and amputees) and patients with brain injuries (e.g. stroke patients). Recent technological advances such as wireless recording, machine learning analysis, and real-time temporal resolution have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI approaches. Many BCI studies have focused on decoding EEG signals associated with whole-body kinematics/kinetics, motor imagery, and various senses. Thus, there is a need to understand the various experimental paradigms used in EEG-based BCI systems. Moreover, given that there are many available options, it is essential to choose the most appropriate BCI application to properly manipulate a neuroprosthetic or neurorehabilitation device. The current review evaluates EEG-based BCI paradigms regarding their advantages and disadvantages from a variety of perspectives. For each paradigm, various EEG decoding algorithms and classification methods are evaluated. The applications of these paradigms with targeted patients are summarized. Finally, potential problems with EEG-based BCI systems are discussed, and possible solutions are proposed."
30522993,"We developed a brain-machine interface (BMI) system for poststroke patients with severe hemiplegia to detect event-related desynchronization (ERD) on scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) and to operate a motor-driven hand orthosis combined with neuromuscular electrical stimulation. ERD arises when the excitability of the ipsi-lesional sensorimotor cortex increases. The aim of this study was to evaluate our hypothesis that motor training using this BMI system could improve severe hemiparesis that is resistant to improvement by conventional rehabilitation. We, therefore, planned and implemented a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intensive rehabilitation using the BMI system. We conducted a single blind, multicenter RCT and recruited chronic poststroke patients with severe hemiparesis more than 90 days after onset (N=40). Participants were randomly allocated to the BMI group (n=20) or the control group (n=20). Patients in the BMI group repeated 10-second motor attempts to operate EEG-BMI 40 min every day followed by 40 min of conventional occupational therapy. The interventions were repeated 10 times in 2 weeks. Control participants performed a simple motor imagery without servo-action of the orthosis, and electrostimulation was given for 10 seconds for 40 min, similar to the BMI intervention. Overall, 40 min of conventional occupational therapy was also given every day after the control intervention, which was also repeated 10 times in 2 weeks. Motor functions and electrophysiological phenotypes of the paretic hands were characterized before (baseline), immediately after (post), and 4 weeks after (follow-up) the intervention. Improvement in the upper extremity score of the Fugl-Meyer assessment between baseline and follow-up was the main outcome of this study. Recruitment started in March 2017 and ended in July 2018. This trial is currently in the data correcting phase. This RCT is expected to be completed by October 31, 2018. No widely accepted intervention has been established to improve finger function of chronic poststroke patients with severe hemiparesis. The results of this study will provide clinical data for regulatory approval and novel, important understanding of the role of sensory-motor feedback based on BMI to induce neural plasticity and motor recovery.

30533323,"There is evidence that 15-30% of the general population cannot effectively operate brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Thus the BCI performance predictors are critically required to pre-screen participants. Current neurophysiological and psychological tests either require complicated equipment or suffer from subjectivity. Thus, a simple and objective BCI performance predictor is desirable. Neurofeedback (NFB) training involves performing a cognitive task (motor imagery) instructed via sensory stimuli and re-adjusted through ongoing real-time feedback. A simple reaction time (SRT) test reflects the time required for a subject to respond to a defined stimulus. Thus, we postulated that individuals with shorter reaction times operate a BCI with rapidly updated feedback better than individuals with longer reaction times. Furthermore, we investigated how changing the feedback update interval (FUI), i.e., modification of the feedback provision frequency, affects the correlation between the SRT and BCI performance. Ten participants attended four NFB sessions with FUIs of 16, 24, 48, and 96 ms in a randomized order. We found that: 1) SRT is correlated with the BCI performance with FUIs of 16 and 96 ms; 2) good and poor performers elicit stronger ERDs and control BCIs more effectively (i.e., produced larger information transfer rates) with 16 and 96 ms FUIs, respectively. Our findings suggest that SRT may be used as a simple and objective surrogate for BCI aptitude with FUIs of 16 and 96 ms. It also implies that the FUI customization according to participants SRT measure may enhance the BCI performance."
30507513,"Although brain-computer interface (BCI) has potential application in the rehabilitation of neural disease and performance improvement of the human in the loop system, it is restricted in the laboratory environment. One of the hindrances behind this restriction is the requirement of a long training data collection session for the user prior to operation of the system at each time. Several approaches have been proposed including the reduction of training data maintaining the robust performance. One of them is active learning (AL) which asks for labeling the training samples and it has the potential to reach robust performance using reduced informative training set. In this paper, one of the AL methods, query by committee (QBC), is applied by forming the committee in heterogeneous and homogeneous feature space. In heterogeneous feature space, three state-of-the-art feature extraction methods are coupled with linear discriminant analysis classifier. For homogeneous feature space, random K -fold sampling is applied after extracting the features using a single method to form the committee of K -members. The joint accuracy by QBC-heterogeneous has obtained the baselines using maximum 35% of the whole training set. It also shows a significant difference at the 5% significance level from QBC-homogeneous selection as well as other contemporary AL methods and random selection method. Thus, QBC-heterogeneous has reduced the labeling effort and the training data collection effort significantly more than that of random labeling process. It infers that QBC is a potential candidate for abridging overall calibration time of BCI systems."
30510569,"Classification of motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) plays a vital role in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Recent research has shown that nonlinear classification algorithms perform better than their linear counterparts, but most of them cannot extract sufficient significant information which leads to a less efficient classification. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called FDDL-ELM, which combines the discriminative power of extreme learning machine (ELM) with the reconstruction capability of sparse representation. Firstly, the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is adopted to perform spatial filtering on raw EEG data to enhance the task-related neural activity. Secondly, the Fisher discrimination criterion is employed to learn a structured dictionary and obtain sparse coding coefficients from the filtered data, and these discriminative coefficients are then used to acquire the reconstructed feature representations. Finally, a nonlinear classifier ELM is used to identify these features in different MI tasks. The proposed method is evaluated on 2-class Datasets IVa and IIIa of BCI Competition III and 4-class Dataset IIa of BCI Competition IV. Experimental results show that our method achieved superior performance than the other existing algorithms and yielded the accuracies of 80.68%, 87.54%, and 63.76% across all subjects in the above-mentioned three datasets, respectively."
30510537,"Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are thought to revolutionize rehabilitation after SCI, e.g., by controlling neuroprostheses, exoskeletons, functional electrical stimulation, or a combination of these components. However, most BCI research was performed in healthy volunteers and it is unknown whether these results can be translated to patients with spinal cord injury because of neuroplasticity. We sought to examine whether high-density EEG (HD-EEG) could improve the performance of motor-imagery classification in patients with SCI. We recorded HD-EEG with 256 channels in 22 healthy controls and 7 patients with 14 recordings (4 patients had more than one recording) in an event related design. Participants were instructed acoustically to either imagine, execute, or observe foot and hand movements, or to rest. We calculated Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and full frequency directed transfer function (ffDTF) for each condition and classified conditions pairwise with support vector machines when using only 2 channels over the sensorimotor area, full 10-20 montage, high-density montage of the sensorimotor cortex, and full HD-montage. Classification accuracies were comparable between patients and controls, with an advantage for controls for classifications that involved the foot movement condition. Full montages led to better results for both groups (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and classification accuracies were higher for FFT than for ffDTF (<i>p</i> < 0.001), for which the feature vector might be too long. However, full-montage 10-20 montage was comparable to high-density configurations. Motor-imagery driven control of neuroprostheses or BCI systems may perform as well in patients as in healthy volunteers with adequate technical configuration. We suggest the use of a whole-head montage and analysis of a broad frequency range."
30499562,"To study the electric brain activity during motor imagery task in the brain-computer interface (BCI) in motor-disabled patients to determine the optimal ways for using BCI-based ideomotor training in medical rehabilitation. The study included 26 patients with arm motor dysfunction caused by a stroke or a spinal cord injury. They were involved in motor imagery training in the BCI. The power and localization of electroencephalographic (EEG) event-related desynchronization during imagery of different arm movements were measured. The accuracy in the two-command BCI was assessed. The pattern of imagery-related EEG desynchronization showed the typical localization for such tasks. Despite the fact that the power of EEG reactions during motor imagery in motor-disabled patients was on average lower than in healthy subjects during a similar task, all the patients were able to achieve high accuracy in the two-command BCI system after several (at least three) training sessions. Our results demonstrate the great potential for using BCI-based motor imagery training for neurorehabilitation of patients with motor dysfunctions."
30488148,"Even though it has long been felt that psychological state influences the performance of brain-computer interfaces (BCI), formal analysis to support this hypothesis has been scant. This study investigates the inter-relationship between motor imagery (MI) and mental fatigue using EEG: a. whether prolonged sequences of MI produce mental fatigue and b. whether mental fatigue affects MI EEG class separability. Eleven participants participated in the MI experiment, 5 of which quit in the middle because of experiencing high fatigue. The growth of fatigue was monitored using the Kernel Partial Least Square (KPLS) algorithm on the remaining 6 participants which shows that MI induces substantial mental fatigue. Statistical analysis of the effect of fatigue on motor imagery performance shows that high fatigue level significantly decreases MI EEG separability. Collectively, these results portray an MI-fatigue inter-connection, emphasizing the necessity of developing adaptive MI BCI by tracking mental fatigue."
33501008,"Motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) extract commands in real-time and can be used to control a cursor, a robot or functional electrical stimulation (FES) devices. The control of FES devices is especially interesting for stroke rehabilitation, when a patient can use motor imagery to stimulate specific muscles in real-time. However, damage to motor areas resulting from stroke or other causes might impair control of a motor imagery BCI for rehabilitation. The current work presents a comparative evaluation of the MI-based BCI control accuracy between stroke patients and healthy subjects. Five patients who had a stroke that affected the motor system participated in the current study, and were trained across 10-24 sessions lasting about 1 h each with the recoveriX system. The participants' EEG data were classified while they imagined left or right hand movements, and real-time feedback was provided on a monitor. If the correct imagination was detected, the FES was also activated to move the left or right hand. The grand average mean accuracy was 87.4% for all patients and sessions. All patients were able to achieve at least one session with a maximum accuracy above 96%. Both the mean accuracy and the maximum accuracy were surprisingly high and above results seen with healthy controls in prior studies. Importantly, the study showed that stroke patients can control a MI BCI system with high accuracy relative to healthy persons. This may occur because these patients are highly motivated to participate in a study to improve their motor functions. Participants often reported early in the training of motor improvements and this caused additional motivation. However, it also reflects the efficacy of combining motor imagination, seeing continuous bar feedback, and real hand movement that also activates the tactile and proprioceptive systems. Results also suggested that motor function could improve even if classification accuracy did not, and suggest other new questions to explore in future work. Future studies will also be done with a first-person view 3D avatar to provide improved feedback and thereby increase each patients' sense of engagement."
30474793,"Mentally imagining rather physically executing the motor behaviors is defined as motor imagery (MI). During MI, the mu rhythmical oscillation of cortical neurons is the event-related desynchronization (ERD) subserving the physiological basis of MI-based brain-computer interface. In our work, we investigated the specific brain network reconfiguration from rest idle to MI task states, and also probed the underlying relationship between the brain network reconfiguration and MI related ERD. Findings revealed that comparing to rest state, the MI showed the enhanced motor area related linkages and the deactivated activity of default mode network. In addition, the reconfigured network index was closely related to the ERDs, i.e., the higher the reconfigured network index was, the more obvious the ERDs were. These findings consistently implied that the reconfiguration from rest to task states underlaid the reallocation of related brain resources, and the efficient brain reconfiguration corresponded to a better MI performance, which provided the new insights into understanding the mechanism of MI as well as the potential biomarker to evaluate the rehabilitation quality for those patients with deficits of motor function."
30459588,"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) constitute an alternative channel of communication between humans and environment. There are a number of different technologies which enable the recording of brain activity. One of these is electroencephalography (EEG). The most common EEG methods include interfaces whose operation is based on changes in the activity of Sensorimotor Rhythms (SMR) during imagery movement, so-called Motor Imagery BCI (MIBCI).The present article is a review of 131 articles published from 1997 to 2017 discussing various procedures of data processing in MIBCI. The experiments described in these publications have been compared in terms of the methods used for data registration and analysis. Some of the studies (76 reports) were subjected to meta-analysis which showed corrected average classification accuracy achieved in these studies at the level of 51.96%, a high degree of heterogeneity of results (<i>Q</i> = 1806577.61; <i>df</i> = 486; <i>p</i> < 0.001; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 99.97%), as well as significant effects of number of channels, number of mental images, and method of spatial filtering. On the other hand the meta-regression failed to provide evidence that there was an increase in the effectiveness of the solutions proposed in the articles published in recent years. The authors have proposed a newly developed standard for presenting results acquired during MIBCI experiments, which is designed to facilitate communication and comparison of essential information regarding the effects observed. Also, based on the findings of descriptive analysis and meta-analysis, the authors formulated recommendations regarding practices applied in research on signal processing in MIBCIs."

We test the feasibility and report the performance of this paradigm in wheelchair navigation control. By sequentially imaging left- and right-hand movements, the subjects can complete four sMI tasks in an asynchronous mode that are then encoded to control six steering functions of a wheelchair, including moving forward, turning left, turning right, accelerating, decelerating, and stopping. Two experiments, a simulated experiment, and an online wheelchair navigation experiment, were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in seven subjects. In summary, the subjects completed 99 of 105 experimental trials along a predefined route. The success rate was 94.2% indicating the practicality and the effectiveness of the proposed asynchronous control paradigm in wheelchair navigation control."
30441486,"Recent progress in the number of studies involving brain connectivity analysis of motor imagery (MI) tasks for brain-computer interface (BCI) systems has warranted the need for pre-processing methods. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of current source density (CSD) estimation from raw electroencephalogram (EEG) signals on the classification performance of scalp level brain connectivity feature based MI-BCI. In particular, time-domain partial Granger causality (PGC) method was implemented on the raw EEG signals and CSD signals of a publicly available dataset for the estimation of brain connectivity features. Moreover, pairwise binary classifications of four different MI tasks were performed in inter-session and intra-session conditions using a support vector machine classifier. The results showed that CSD provided a statistically significant increase of the AUC: 20.28% in the inter-session condition; 12.54% and 13.92% with session 01 and session 02, respectively, in the intra-session condition. These results show that pre-processing of EEG signals is crucial for single-trial connectivity features based MI-BCI systems and CSD can enhance their overall performance."
30441485,"Motor imagery (MI) based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are a viable option for giving locked-in syndrome patients independence and communicability. BCIs comprising expensive medical-grade EEG systems evaluated in carefully-controlled, artificial environments are impractical for take-home use. Previous studies evaluated low-cost systems; however, performance was suboptimal or inconclusive. Here we evaluated a low-cost EEG system, OpenBCI, in a natural environment and leveraged neurofeedback, deep learning, and wider temporal windows to improve performance. $\mu-$rhythm data collected over the sensorimotor cortex from healthy participants performing relaxation and right-handed MI tasks were used to train a multi-layer perceptron binary classifier using deep learning.

Such variability further escalates in case of multi-class MI, which is currently a common practice. The failures due to interpersonal variability can be attributed to handcrafted features as they failed to extract more generalized features. The proposed approach employs convolution neural network (CNN) based model with both filtering (through axis shuffling) and feature extraction to avail end-to-end training. Axis shuffling is performed adopted in initial blocks of the model for 1D preprocessing and reduce the parameters required. Such practice has avoided the overfitting which resulted in an improved generalized model. Publicly available BCI Competition-IV 2a dataset is considered to evaluate the proposed model. The proposed model has demonstrated the capability to identify subject-specific frequency band with an average and highest accuracy of 70.5% and S3.6% respectively. Proposed CNN model can classify in real time without relying on accelerated computing device like GPU."
30441483,"Common Spectral Pattern (CSP) algorithm remains predominant for feature extraction from multichannel EEG motor imagery data. However, multiclass classification of from this featureset has been a challenging job. Different approaches have been proposed to be applied on featureset of different EEG subbands to achieve significant classification accuracy. Ensemble learning is very effective in this context to achieve higher accuracy in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) domain. In this study, we have proposed enhanced classification algorithms to achieve higher classification accuracies. The methods were evaluated against the motor imagery data from Dataset 2a of the publicly available BCI Competition IV (2008). This dataset consists of 22 channels EEG data of 9 subjects for four different movements. A tree based ensemble approach for supervised classification, Extra-Trees algorithm, has been proposed in this paper and also evaluated for its efficacy on this dataset to classify between left hand and right hand movement imaginations. Moreover, this classifier has its inherent capability to select optimum features. Furthermore, in this paper an extension of the binary classification into multiclass domain is also implemented with error correcting output codes (ECOC) approach using the same dataset. Subject-specific frequency bands $\alpha$ (8-12Hz) and $\beta$ (12-30Hz) along with $HG$ (70-100Hz) were considered to extract CSP features. We have achieved an individual peak accuracy of 98ȥ and 84ȥ in binary class and multiclass classification respectively. Furthermore, the results yielded a mean kappa value of 0.58 across all the subjects. This kappa value is higher than of the winner of competition and also from the most of the other approaches applied in this dataset."
30441377,"In this paper, we propose a novel and intuitively pleasing graph-based spatio-temporal feature extraction framework for classification of motor imagery tasks from elec- troencephalography (EEG) signals for brain-computer interface systems (BCIs). In particular, to account for the observation that measurements obtained from the EEG channels form a non-uniformly distributed sensor field, a representation graph is constructed using geographical distances between sensors to form connectivity neighborhoods. By capitalizing on the fact that functionality of different connectivity neighborhoods varies based on the intensity of the performed activity and concentration level of the subject, we formed an initial func- tional clustering of EEG electrodes by designing a separate adjacency matrix for each identified functional cluster. Using a collapsing methodology based on total variation measures on graphs, the overall model will eventually be reduced (collapsed) into two functional clusters. The proposed framework offers two main superiorities over its state-of-the-art counterparts: (i) First, the resulting dimensionality reduction is subject-adaptive and respects the brain plasticity of subjects, and; (ii) Second, the proposed methodology identifies active regions of the brain during the motor imagery task, which can be used to re-align EEG electrodes to improve accuracy during consecutive data collection sessions. The experimental results based on Dataset IVa from BCI Competition III show that the proposed method can provide higher classification accuracy as compared to the other existing methods."
30441040,"The Electroencephalogram (EEG) can be considered as the output of a nonlinear system whose dynamics is significantly affected by motor tasks. Nevertheless, computational approaches derived from the complex system theory has not been fully exploited for characterising motor imagery tasks. To this extent, in this study we investigated EEG complexity changes throughout the following categories of imaginary motor tasks of the upper limb: transitive (actions involving an object), intransitive (meaningful gestures that do not include the use of objects), and tool-mediated (actions using an object to interact with another one). EEG irregularity was quantified following the definition of Fuzzy Entropy, which has been demonstrated to be a reliable quantifier of system complexity with low dependence on data length. Experimental results from paired statistical analyses revealed minor topographical changes between EEG complexity associated with transitive and tool-mediated tasks, whereas major significant differences were shown between the intransitive actions vs. the others. Our results suggest that EEG complexity level during motor imagery tasks of the upper limb are strongly biased by the presence of an object."
30440922,"Brain-computer Interfaces (BCIs) provide a direct pathway between the brain and the outward environment. Specifically, motor imagery (MI)-based BCI controlling functional electric stimulation (FES) is a promising approach for disabled patients with intact mind to restore or rehabilitate their motor functions. This study probed for the improvement of cortical activation for motor imagery during the closed-loop BCI-FES training. We used electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to inspect the cortical activation for four different training strategies, i.e. MI-BCI-FES, MI-FES, MI and FES. Compared with the other three training conditions, the MI-BCI-FES could achieve stronger cortical activation viewing from the event-related desynchronization (ERD) and the blood oxygen response. The results demonstrate that the closed-loop MI training using BCI-FES can prospectively increase the cortical activation of motor cortical areas."
30440859,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a novel method for stroke rehabilitation. However, lacking of sufficient motor-related cortical activity greatly decreases the BCI performance in stroke patients. Interestingly, high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to increase the cortical excitability of lesioned hemisphere in stroke patients. This stimulation effect may have benefits on the enhancement of BCI decoding. This study recruited 16 stroke patients to evaluate the stimulation effect on BCI accuracy, with 8 patients were assigned to the TMS-group and the other 8 patients were assigned to the Control-group. Patients in the TMS-group underwent 12 sessions of 10-Hz TMS interventions in four consecutive weeks, whereas no stimulation was applied during this period in the Control-group. Meanwhile, three BCI evaluation sessions were carried out in one day before, one day after, and three days after the TMS intervention, separately. The results showed that the TMS intervention significantly improved the BCI accuracy from 63.5% to 74.3% in motor imagery (MI) tasks, and from 81.9% to 91.1% in motor execution (ME) tasks. This finding provides a novel method for the cure of BCI-inefficiency problem, and may facilitate the clinical application of BCI-based stroke rehabilitation."
30440834,"This work studies a novel transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) montage to improve a brain-machine interface (BMI) lower limb motor imagery detection. The tDCS montage is composed by two anodes and one cathode. One anode is located over the motor cortex and the other one over the cerebellum. Ten healthy subjects participated in this experiment. They were randomly separated into two groups: sham, which received a fake stimulation, and active tDCS, which received a real stimulation. Each subject was experimented on five consecutive days. Results pointed out that there was a significant difference $(p < 0 .05)$ in the classification accuracy between the sham and the active tDCS group. On each of the five days of the experiment the active tDCS group achieved better accuracy results than the sham group: 4%, 10%, 10%, 9% and 7% higher respectively."
30440793,"Various adaptation techniques have been proposed to address the non-stationarity issue faced by electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, most of these adaptation techniques are only suitable for binary-class BCIs. This paper proposes a supervised multiclass data space adaptation technique (MDSA) to transform the test data using a linear transformation such that the distribution difference between the multiclass train and test data is minimized. The results of using the proposed MDSA on BCI Competition IV dataset 2a improved the classification accuracy by an average of 4.3% when 20 trials per class were used from the test session to estimate adaptation transformation. The results also showed that the proposed MDSA algorithm outperformed the multi pooled mean linear discrimination (MPMLDA) technique with as few as 10 trials per class used for calculating the transformation matrix. Hence the results showed the effectiveness of the proposed MDSA algorithm in addressing non-stationarity issue for multiclass EEG-based BCI."
30440791,"Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) provides an alternate channel of interaction for people with severe motor disabilities. The Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm is effective in extracting discriminative features from EEG data for motor imagery-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). CSP yields signal from various locations for better performance. In this study, we selected a subset of EEG channels using correlation coefficient of spectral entropy and compared the classification performance using the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) algorithm. We conducted experiments on 4 healthy subjects and one Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patient. The results showed that the proposed channel selection method increased classification accuracy of all subjects from 1.25% to 8.22%. Optimal performance was obtained using between 13 to 24 channels, and channels located over the motor cortex zone possess higher probabilities of being selected. Comparing with the channels manually selected to over the motor cortex area, the correlation coefficient method is able to identify the optimal channel combination and improve the motor imagery decoding accuracy of Healthy and ALS subjects."
30440789,"Subject-specific calibration plays an important role in electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for Motor Imagery (MI) detection. A calibration session is often introduced to build a subject specific model, which then can be deployed into BCI system for MI detection in the following rehabilitation sessions. The model is termed as a fixed calibration model. Progressive adaptive models can also be built by using data not only from calibration session, but also from available rehabilitation sessions. It was reported that the progressive adaptive model yielded significant improved MI detection compared to the fixed model in a retrospective clinical study. In this work, we deploy the progressive adaptation model in a BCI-based stroke rehabilitation system and bring it online. We dub this system nBETTER (Neurostyle Brain Exercise Therapy Towards Enhanced Recovery). A clinical trial using the nBETTER system was conducted to evaluate the performance of 11 stroke patients who underwent a calibration session followed by 18 rehabilitation sessions over 6 weeks. We conduct retrospective analysis to compare the performance of various modeling strategies: the fixed calibration model, the online progressive adaptation model and a light-weight adaptation model, where the second one is generated online by nBETTER system and the other two models are obtained retrospectively. The mean accuracy of the three models across 11 subjects are 68.17%, 74.04% and 74.53% respectively. Statistical test conducted on the three groups using ANOVA yields a p-value of 9.83-e06. The test result shows that the two adaptation models both have significant different mean from fixed mode. Hence our study confirmed the effectiveness of using the progressive adaptive model for EEGbased BCI to detect MI in an online setting."
30440782,"Motor Imagery (MI) based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems have shown potential to serve as a tool for neurorehabilitation for post stroke patients to complement the standard therapy. The aim of this study was to develop an MI based BCI system that could potentially be used in neurorehabilitation of hand motor function in stroke patients. Two co-adaptive, three-class MI based BCI systems for realtime processing were developed and compared using the publicly available data from the BCI Competition III Dataset V as well as our own data. The first algorithm utilizes the Filterbank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) for feature extraction, and the other utilizes the Separable Common Spatio-Spectral Pattern (SCSSP) - both combined with a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) for classification. The proposed system proved successful when using the competition data showing an average accuracy of 64.71 % for the SCSSP compared to 60.48% for the FBCSP. This proved superior to a related study using the same feature extraction methods, but with other classification methods. The proposed system, however did show results around chance level for the 3-class MI experimental data that we have collected in our laboratory. Further studies needs to be conducted to improve the performance as well as to realize such a system to put in use."
30440769,"Motor imagery (MI) based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is an important active BCI paradigm for recognizing movement intention of severely disabled persons. There are extensive studies about MI-based intention recognition, most of which heavily rely on staged handcrafted EEG feature extraction and classifier design. For end-to-end deep learning methods, researchers encode spatial information with convolution neural networks (CNNs) from raw EEG data. Compared with CNNs, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) allow for long-range lateral interactions between features. In this paper, we proposed a pure RNNs-based parallel method for encoding spatial and temporal sequential raw data with bidirectional Long Short- Term Memory (bi-LSTM) and standard LSTM, respectively. Firstly, we rearranged the index of EEG electrodes considering their spatial location relationship. Secondly, we applied sliding window method over raw EEG data to obtain more samples and split them into training and testing sets according to their original trial index. Thirdly, we utilized the samples and their transposed matrix as input to the proposed pure RNNs- based parallel method, which encodes spatial and temporal information simultaneously. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated in the public MI-based eegmmidb dataset and compared with the other three methods (CSP+LDA, FBCSP+LDA, and CNN-RNN method). The experiment results demonstrated the superior performance of our proposed pure RNNs-based parallel method. In the multi-class trial-wise movement intention classification scenario, our approach obtained an average accuracy of 68.20% and significantly outperformed other three methods with an 8.25% improvement of relative accuracy on average, which proves the feasibility of our approach for the real-world BCI system."
30440578,"Non-invasive brain computer interface (BCI) has been successfully used to control cursors, helicopters and robotic arms. However, this technology is not widely adopted by people with late-stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) due to poor effectiveness. In this study, we attempt to assess the cognitive state of a completely locked-in ALS subject, and her ability to use motor imagery-based BCI for control. The subject achieves above chance level accuracies for both open loop (62.2%) and closed-loop (68.7%) 2-class movement vs. idle decoding. We also observe a prominent theta oscillation with peak frequency at 4.5 Hz during the experiments. Quantification shows that the theta oscillatory power increases during motor imagery tasks compared to idle tasks for both open-loop as well as closed-loop BCI tasks. Furthermore, for closed-loop sessions, theta oscillation power correlates positively with feedback accuracy during movement tasks, and negatively with feedback accuracy during idle tasks. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of motor imagery-based BCI for late-stage ALS subjects, and highlights the importance of feedback during BCI implementation."
30440571,"Mapping the brain alterations post stroke and post intervention is important for rehabilitation therapy development. Previous work has shown changes in functional connectivity based on resting-state fMRI, structural connectivity derived from diffusion MRI and perfusion as a result of brain-computer interface-assisted motor imagery (MI-BCI) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in upper-limb stroke rehabilitation. Besides functional connectivity, regional amplitude of local low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) may provide complementary information on the underlying neural mechanism in disease. Yet, findings on spontaneous brain activity during resting-state in stroke patients after intervention are limited and inconsistent. Here, we sought to investigate the different brain alteration patterns induced by tDCS compared to MI-BCI for upper-limb rehabilitation in chronic stroke patients using resting-state fMRI-based ALFF method. Our results suggested that stroke patients have lower ALFF in the ipsilesional somatomotor network compared to controls at baseline. Increased ALFF at contralesional somatomotor network and alterations in higher-level cognitive networks such as the default mode network (DMN) and salience networks accompany motor recovery after intervention; though the MI-BCI alone group and MI-BCI combined with tDCS group exhibit differential patterns."
30440381,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) has been widely introduced in many medical applications. One of the main challenges in BCI is to run the signal processing algorithms in real-time which is challenging and usually comes with high processing unit costs. BCIs based on motor imagery task are introduced for severe neurological diseases especially locked-in patients. A common concept is to detect one's movement intention and use it to control external devices such as wheelchair or rehabilitation devices. In real-time BCI, running the signal processing algorithms might not always be possible due to the complexity of the algorithms. Moreover, the speed of the affordable computational units is not usually enough for those applications. This study evaluated a range of feature extraction methods which are commonly used for such real-time BCI applications. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Electrooculogram (EOG) data available through IEEE Brain Initiative repository was used to investigate the performance of different feature extraction methods including template matching, statistical moments, selective bandpower, and fast Fourier transform (FFT) power spectrum. The support vector machine (SVM) was used for classification. The result indicates that there is not a significant difference when utilizing different feature extraction methods in terms of movement prediction although there is a vast difference in the computational time needed to extract these features. The results suggest that computational time could be considered as the primary parameter when choosing the feature extraction methods as there is no significant difference between the results when different features extraction methods are used."
30440377,"In Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Research,Electroencephalography (EEG) has obtained great attention for biomedical applications. In BCI system, feature representation and classification are important tasks as the accuracy of classification highly depends on these stages. In this paper, we propose a model in which Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) is used to discriminate inter-class data using co-variance maximization and Fast Fourier Transform Energy Map (FFTEM) is used for feature selection and mapping of 1D data into 2D data (energy maps). Convolutional Neural Network is used for classification of multi-class Motor Imagery (MI) signals. Further, this paper investigates near-optimal parameter selection for feature mapping, frequency bands selection, and temporal segmentation. It is shown that our proposed method outperformed the reported methods by achieving 0.61 mean kappa value."
30440376,"Use of Motor Imagery in EEG signals is gaining importance to develop Brain Computer Interface (BCI) applications in various fields ranging from bio-medical to entertainment. Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) algorithm is a promising feature extraction technique to deal with subject-specific behavior in Motor Imagery classification. Using FBCSP on EEG we have developed an accurate but less computationally expensive approach by making use of Time Domain Parameters (TDP) and Band Power (BP) features to form a combined feature set. The novelty of our approach is also the use of optimal time segmentation to overcome non-stationary state behavior of Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) and Event-Related Synchronization (ERS) over time. We analyzed the impact of parameter variations on classification accuracy and achieved 0.59 mean kappa value for Dataset 2a BCI competition IV, the highest reported for FBCSP approaches, along with the lowest inter-subject variation."
30440375,"Motor imagery-based BCIs are the most natural human-computer interaction paradigms. In recent years, researchers have tried to decode the kinetic information of motor imagery. In this paper, we analyzed and discriminated the EEG patterns of different force levels motor imagery using MRCPs. In the experiment, nine healthy subjects were required to perform the hand force motor imagery tasks (30% MVC and 10% MVC). From the view of MRCPs, the most significant discrimination between the two levels of mental tasks was the manifestation of motor planning. The average classification accuracy for features involving both MRCP and CSP was 78.3%, which was 8.5% higher than the CSP-based features (p¡0.001) and 2% higher than the MRCP-based features. The results demonstrated the feasibility of using MRCPs for hand force motor imagery classification."
30440374,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) make humancomputer interaction more natural, especially for people with neuro-muscular disabilities. Among various data acquisition modalities the electroencephalograms (EEG) occupy the most prominent place due to their non-invasiveness. In this work, a method based on sparse kernel machines is proposed for the classification of motor imagery (MI) EEG data. More specifically, a new sparse prior is proposed for the selection of the most important information and the estimation of model parameters is performed using the bayesian framework. The experimental results obtained on a benchmarking EEG dataset for MI, have shown that the proposed method compares favorably with state of the art approaches in BCI literature."
30440373,"The use of motion assistance devices improves the rehabilitation process of patients that have motor disabilities. In the case these devices are controlled by brain-machine interfaces, the rehabilitation process can be improved due to neuroplasticity. However, in the case of lower limb rehabilitation, the limited accuracy of the control algorithms is a serious difficulty to overcome. In this research, different EEG signal's processing techniques, based on motor imagery, are tested for a brain-computer interface in an offline scenario, in order to detect the limitations of the models previous to its realtime implementation. The results reveal that motor imagery is very dependent on the subject and that Stockwell Transform provides the best accuracy among the models tested."
30440266,"Despite all the work in the Brain Computer Interface (BCI) community, one of the main issues that prevents it from becoming pervasive is the limitation on the number of commands with a satisfactory accuracy of detection. In this paper, we propose a solution to increase the number of commands while maintaining a satisfactory accuracy performance via a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)- Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The setup makes use of a classifier (a CNN) that works over a small alphabet of established mental tasks like the motor imagery task and detects sequences comprised of these tasks using HMMs. To optimize the learning capacity, we select a subset of sequences by measuring the distance between HMM models. This system, based on the experiments we have conducted, shows a 14% gain in accuracy over the non-sequenced classifier. Alternatively, it can be used to increase the command set size by 4 times when using all the channels or by 1.5 times when using only 1/3 of the EEG channels and have the same performance as a non-sequenced classifier that uses all available channels. This shows that the CNN-HMM hybrid model is a viable approach to increase the capacity of learning in BCI."
30402801,"Independent component analysis (ICA) is a potential spatial filtering method for the implementation of motor imagery brain-computer interface (MIBCI). However, ICA-based MIBCI (ICA-MIBCI) is sensitive to electroencephalogram (EEG) channels and the quality of the training data, which are two crucial factors affecting the stability and classification performance of ICA-MIBCI. To address these problems, this paper is mainly focused on the investigation of EEG channel optimization. As a reference, we constructed a single-trial-based ICA-MIBCI system with commonly used channels and common spatial pattern-based MIBCI (CSP-MIBCI). To minimize the impact of artifacts on EEG channel optimization, a data-quality evaluation method, named ""self-testing"" in this paper, was used in a single-trial-based ICA-MIBCI system to evaluate the quality of single trials in each dataset; the resulting self-testing accuracies were used for the selection of high-quality trials. Given several candidate channel configurations, ICA filters were calculated using selected high-quality trials and applied to the corresponding ICA-MIBCI implementation. Optimal channels for each dataset were assessed and selected according to the self-testing results related to various candidate configurations. Forty-eight MI datasets of six subjects were employed in this study to validate the proposed methods. Experimental results revealed that the average classification accuracy of the optimal channels yielded a relative increment of 2.8% and 8.5% during self-testing, 14.4% and 9.5% during session-to-session transfer, and 36.2% and 26.7% during subject-to-subject transfer compared to CSP-MIBCI and ICA-MIBCI with fixed the channel configuration. This work indicates that the proposed methods can efficiently improve the practical feasibility of ICA-MIBCI."
30400325,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can be used to induce neural plasticity in the human nervous system by pairing motor cortical activity with relevant afferent feedback, which can be used in neurorehabilitation. The aim of this study was to identify the optimal type or combination of afferent feedback modalities to increase cortical excitability in a BCI training intervention. In three experimental sessions, 12 healthy participants imagined a dorsiflexion that was decoded by a BCI which activated relevant afferent feedback: (1) electrical nerve stimulation (ES) (peroneal nerve-innervating tibialis anterior), (2) passive movement (PM) of the ankle joint, or (3) combined electrical stimulation and passive movement (Comb). The cortical excitability was assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation determining motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in tibialis anterior before, immediately after and 30 min after the BCI training. Linear mixed regression models were used to assess the changes in MEPs. The three interventions led to a significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) increase in MEP amplitudes immediately and 30 min after the training. The effect sizes of Comb paradigm were larger than ES and PM, although, these differences were not statistically significant (<i>p</i> > 0.05). These results indicate that the timing of movement imagery and afferent feedback is the main determinant of induced cortical plasticity whereas the specific type of feedback has a moderate impact. These findings can be important for the translation of such a BCI protocol to the clinical practice where by combining the BCI with the already available equipment cortical plasticity can be effectively induced. The findings in the current study need to be validated in stroke populations."
30384845,"Physical motor exercise aided by an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is known to improve motor recovery in patients with stroke. In such a BCI paradigm, event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the alpha and beta bands extracted from EEG recorded over the primary sensorimotor area (SM1) is often used, since ERD has been suggested to be associated with an increase of corticospinal excitability. Recently, we demonstrated a novel online lock-in amplifier (LIA) algorithm to estimate the amplitude modulation of motor-related SM1 ERD. With this algorithm, the delay time, accuracy, and stability to estimate motor-related SM1 ERD were significantly improved compared with the conventional fast Fourier transformation (FFT) algorithm. These technical improvements to extract an ERD trace imply a potential advantage for a better trace of the excitatory status of the SM1 in a BCI context. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the precision of LIA-based ERD tracking for estimation of corticospinal excitability using a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm. The motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by single-pulse TMS over the primary motor cortex depending on the magnitudes of SM1 ERD (i.e., 35% and 70%) extracted by the online LIA or FFT algorithm were monitored during a motor imagery task of wrist extension in 17 healthy participants. Then, the peak-to-peak amplitudes of MEPs and their variabilities were assessed to investigate the precision of the algorithms. We found greater MEP amplitude evoked by single-pulse TMS triggered by motor imagery-related alpha SM1 ERD than at rest. This enhancement was associated with the magnitude of ERD in both FFT and LIA algorithms. Moreover, we found that the variabilities of peak-to-peak MEP amplitudes at 35% and 70% ERDs calculated by the novel online LIA algorithm were smaller than those extracted using the conventional FFT algorithm. The present study demonstrated that the calculation of motor imagery-related SM1 ERDs using the novel online LIA algorithm led to a more precise estimation of corticospinal excitability than when the ordinary FFT-based algorithm was used."
30380372,"<i>Purpose</i>: The use of standardized screening protocols may inform brain-computer interface (BCI) research procedures to help maximize BCI performance outcomes and provide foundational information for clinical translation. Therefore, in this study we developed and evaluated a new BCI screening protocol incorporating cognitive, sensory, motor and motor imagery tasks. <i>Methods</i>: Following development, BCI screener outcomes were compared to the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Cognitive Behavioral Screen (ALS-CBS), and ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALS-FRS) for twelve individuals with a neuromotor disorder. <i>Results</i>: Scores on the cognitive portion of the BCI screener demonstrated limited variability, indicating all participants possessed core BCI-related skills. When compared to the ALS-CBS, the BCI screener was able to modestly discriminate possible cognitive difficulties that are likely to influence BCI performance. In addition, correlations between the motor imagery section of the screener and ALS-CBS and ALS-FRS were non-significant, suggesting the BCI screener may provide information not captured on other assessment tools. Additional differences were found between motor imagery tasks, with greater self-ratings on first-person explicit imagery of familiar tasks compared to unfamiliar/generic BCI tasks. <i>Conclusion</i>: The BCI screener captures factors likely relevant for BCI, which has value for guiding person-centered BCI assessment across different devices to help inform BCI trials."
30373619,"Phase synchrony has extensively been studied for understanding neural coordination in health and disease. There are a few studies concerning the implications in the context of BCIs, but its potential for establishing a communication channel in patients suffering from neuromuscular disorders remains totally unexplored. We investigate, here, this possibility by estimating the time-resolved phase connectivity patterns induced during a motor imagery (MI) task and adopting a supervised learning scheme to recover the subject's intention from the streaming data. Electroencephalographic activity from six patients suffering from neuromuscular disease (NMD) and six healthy individuals was recorded during two randomly alternating, externally cued, MI tasks (clenching either left or right fist) and a rest condition. The metric of Phase locking value (PLV) was used to describe the functional coupling between all recording sites. The functional connectivity patterns and the associate network organization was first compared between the two cohorts. Next, working at the level of individual patients, we trained support vector machines (SVMs) to discriminate between ""left"" and ""right"" based on different instantiations of connectivity patterns (depending on the encountered brain rhythm and the temporal interval). Finally, we designed and realized a novel brain decoding scheme that could interpret the intention from streaming connectivity patterns, based on an ensemble of SVMs. The group-level analysis revealed increased phase synchrony and richer network organization in patients. This trend was also seen in the performance of the employed classifiers. Time-resolved connectivity led to superior performance, with distinct SVMs acting as local experts, specialized in the patterning emerged within specific temporal windows (defined with respect to the external trigger). This empirical finding was further exploited in implementing a decoding scheme that can be activated without the need of the precise timing of a trigger. The increased phase synchrony in NMD patients can turn to a valuable tool for MI decoding. Considering the fast implementation for the PLV pattern computation in multichannel signals, we can envision the development of efficient personalized BCI systems in assistance of these patients."
30371375,"Bimanual movements are an integral part of everyday activities and are often included in rehabilitation therapies. Yet, electroencephalography (EEG)-based assistive and rehabilitative brain-computer interface (BCI) systems typically rely on motor imagination (MI) of one limb at the time. In this paper, we present a classifier which discriminates between uni-and bi-manual MI. Ten able-bodied participants took part in cue-based motor execution (ME) and MI tasks of the left (L), right (R) and both (B) hands. A 32-channel EEG was recorded. Three linear discriminant analysis classifiers, based on MI of L-B, B-R, and B-L hands were created, with features based on wide band common spatial patterns (CSP) 8-30 Hz, and band specifics common spatial patterns (CSPb). Event-related desynchronization (ERD) was significantly stronger during bimanual compared to unimanual ME on both hemispheres. Bimanual MI resulted in bilateral parietally shifted ERD of similar intensity to unimanual MI. The average classification accuracy for CSP and CSPb was comparable for the L-R task (73% ± 9% and 75% ± 10%, respectively) and for the L-B task (73% ± 11% and 70% ± 9%, respectively). However, for the R-B task (67% ± 3% and 72% ± 6%, respectively), it was significantly higher for CSPb ( ). Six participants whose L-R classification accuracy exceeded 70% were included in an online task a week later, using the unmodified offline CSPb classifier, achieving 69% ± 3% and 66% ± 3% accuracy for L-R and R-B tasks, respectively. Combined uni- and bi-manual BCI could be used for restoration of motor function of highly disabled patents and for motor rehabilitation of patients with motor deficits."
30370718,"In order to realize brain-computer interface (BCI), optimal features of single trail motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) were extracted and classified. Mu rhythm of EEG was obtained by preprocessing, and the features were optimized by spatial filtering, which are estimated from a set of data by method of common spatial pattern. Classification decision can be made by Fisher criterion, and classification performance can be evaluated by cross validation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Optimal feature dimension determination projected by spatial filter was discussed deeply in cross-validation way. The experimental results show that the high discriminate accuracy can be guaranteed, meanwhile the program running speed is improved. Motor imagery intention classification based on optimized EEG feature provides difference of states and simplifies the recognition processing, which offers a new method for the research of intention recognition."
30349004,"Invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) require surgeries with high health-risks. The risk-to-benefit ratio of the procedure could potentially be improved by pre-surgically identifying the ideal locations for mental strategy classification. We recorded high-spatiotemporal resolution blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signals using functional MRI at 7 Tesla in eleven healthy participants during two motor imagery tasks. BCI diagnostic task isolated the intent to imagine movements, while BCI simulation task simulated the neural states that may be yielded in a real-life BCI-operation scenario. Imagination of movements were classified from the BOLD signals in sub-regions of activation within a single or multiple dorsal motor network regions. Then, the participant's decoding performance during the BCI simulation task was predicted from the BCI diagnostic task. The results revealed that drawing information from multiple regions compared to a single region increased the classification accuracy of imagined movements. Importantly, systematic unimodal and multimodal classification revealed the ideal combination of regions that yielded the best classification accuracy at the individual-level. Lastly, a given participant's decoding performance achieved during the BCI simulation task could be predicted from the BCI diagnostic task. These results show the feasibility of 7T-fMRI with unimodal and multimodal classification being utilized for identifying ideal sites for mental strategy classification."
30338495,"The electroencephalogram signals are used to distinguish different motor imagery tasks in brain-computer interfaces. In most studies, in order to classify the EEG signals recorded in a cue-guided BCI paradigm, time segments for feature extraction after the onset of the visual cue were selected manually. In addition, in these studies the authors have selected a single identical time segment for different subjects. The present study emphasized on the inter-individual variability and difference between different motor imagery tasks as the potential source of erroneous results and used mutual information and the subject specific time interval to overcome this problem. More specifically, a new method was proposed to automatically find the best subject specific time intervals for the classification of four-class motor imagery tasks by using MI between the BCI input and output. Moreover, the signal-to-noise ratio was used to calculate the MI values, while the MI values were used as feature selection criteria to select the discriminative features. The time segments and the best discriminative features were found by using training data and used to assess the evaluation data. Furthermore, the CSP algorithm was used to extract signal features. The dataset 2A of BCI competition IV used in this study consisted of four different motor imagery signals, which were obtained from nine different subjects. One Vs One decomposition scheme was used to deal with the multi-class nature of the problem. The MI values showed that the obtained time segments not only varied between different subjects but also varied between different classifiers of different pair of classes. Finally, the results suggested that the proposed method was efficient in classifying multi-class motor imagery signals as compared to other classification strategies proposed by the other studies."
30336362,"This paper describes the implementation of a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) scheme using a common spatial patterns (CSP) filter in combination with a Recursive Least Squares (RLS) approach to iteratively update the coefficients of the CSP filter. The proposed adaptive CSP (ACSP) algorithm is made more robust by introducing regularization using Diagonal Loading (DL), and thus will be able to significantly reduce the length of training sessions when introducing new patients to the BCI system. The system is tested on a 4-class multi-limb motor imagery (MI) data set from the BCI competition IV (2a), and a more complex single limb 3-class MI dataset recorded in-house. The latter dataset is produced to mimic an upper limb rehabilitation session, e.g., after stroke. The findings indicate that when extensive calibration data is available, the ACSP performs comparably to the CSP (kappa value of 0.523 and 0.502, respectively, for the 4-class problem); for reduced calibration sessions, the ACSP significantly improved the performance of the system (up to 4-fold). The proposed paradigm proved feasible and the ACSP algorithm seems to enable a user or semi user independent scenario, where the need for long system calibration sessions without feedback is eliminated."
30334800,"Classification of motor imagery electroencephalograph signals is a fundamental problem in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. We propose in this paper a classification framework based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. To achieve robust classification, a one dimension-aggregate approximation (1d-AX) is employed to extract effective signal representation for LSTM networks. Inspired by classical common spatial pattern, channel weighting technique is further deployed to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed classification framework. Public BCI competition data are used for the evaluation of the proposed feature extraction and classification network, whose performance is also compared with that of the state-of-the-arts approaches based on other deep networks."
30325349,"Recent advancements in brain computer interfaces (BCI) have demonstrated control of robotic systems by mental processes alone. Together with invasive BCI, electroencephalographic (EEG) BCI represent an important direction in the development of BCI systems. In the context of EEG BCI, the processing of EEG data is the key challenge. Unfortunately, advances in that direction have been complicated by a lack of large and uniform datasets that could be used to design and evaluate different data processing approaches. In this work, we release a large set of EEG BCI data collected during the development of a slow cortical potentials-based EEG BCI. The dataset contains 60 h of EEG recordings, 13 participants, 75 recording sessions, 201 individual EEG BCI interaction session-segments, and over 60 000 examples of motor imageries in 4 interaction paradigms. The current dataset presents one of the largest EEG BCI datasets publically available to date."
30323737,"High accuracy decoding of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is still a major challenge that can hardly be solved in the design of an effective motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (BCI), especially when the signal contains various extreme artifacts and outliers arose from data loss. The conventional process to avoid such cases is to directly reject the entire severely contaminated EEG segments, which leads to a drawback that the BCI has no decoding results during that certain period. In this study, a novel decoding scheme based on the combination of Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP) and deep belief network (DBN) was proposed to recognize the incomplete motor imagery EEG. Particularly, instead of discarding the entire segment, two forms of data removal were adopted to eliminate the EEG portions with extreme artifacts and data loss. The LSP was utilized to steadily extract the power spectral density (PSD) features from the incomplete EEG constructed by the remaining portions. A DBN structure based on the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) was exploited and optimized to perform the classification task. Various comparative experiments were conducted and evaluated on simulated signal and real incomplete motor imagery EEG, including the comparison of three PSD extraction methods (fast Fourier transform, Welch and LSP) and two classifiers (DBN and support vector machine, SVM). The results demonstrate that the LSP can estimate relative robust PSD features and the proposed scheme can significantly improve the decoding performance for the incomplete motor imagery EEG. This scheme can provide an alternative decoding solution for the motor imagery EEG contaminated by extreme artifacts and data loss. It can be beneficial to promote the stability, smoothness and maintain consecutive outputs without interruption for a BCI system that is suitable for the online and long-term application."
30281428,"While noninvasive electroenceph-alography (EEG) based brain-computer interfacing (BCI) has been successfully demonstrated in two-dimensional (2-D) control tasks, little work has been published regarding its extension to practical three-dimensional (3-D) control. In this study, we developed a new BCI approach for 3-D control by combining a novel form of endogenous visuospatial attentional modulation, defined as overt spatial attention (OSA), and motor imagery (MI). OSA modulation was shown to provide comparable control to conventional MI modulation in both 1-D and 2-D tasks. Furthermore, this paper provides evidence for the functional independence of traditional MI and OSA, as well as an investigation into the simultaneous use of both. Using this newly proposed BCI paradigm, 16 participants successfully completed a 3-D eight-target control task. Nine of these subjects further demonstrated robust 3-D control in a 12-target task, significantly outperforming the information transfer rate achieved in the 1-D and 2-D control tasks (29.7 ± 1.6 b/min). These results strongly support the hypothesis that noninvasive EEG-based BCI can provide robust 3-D control through endogenous neural modulation in broader populations with limited training. Through the combination of the two strategies (MI and OSA), a substantial portion of the recruited subjects were capable of robustly controlling a virtual cursor in 3-D space. The proposed novel approach could broaden the dimensionality of BCI control and shorten the training time."
30277219,"Neural engineering research is actively engaged in optimizing the robustness of sensorimotor rhythms (SMR)-brain-computer interface (BCI) to boost its potential real-world use. This paper investigates two vital factors in efficient and robust SMR-BCI design-algorithms that address subject-variability of optimal features and neurophysiological factors that correlate with BCI performance. Existing SMR-BCI research using electroencephalogram (EEG) to classify bilateral motor imagery (MI) focus on identifying subject-specific frequency bands with most discriminative motor patterns localized to sensorimotor region. A novel strategy to further optimize BCI performance by taking into account the variability of discriminative spectral regions across various EEG channels is proposed in this paper. The proposed technique results in a significant ([Formula: see text]) increase in average ([Formula: see text]) classification accuracy by [Formula: see text] accompanied by a considerable reduction in number of channels and bands. The session-to-session transfer variation in spectro-spatial patterns using proposed algorithm is investigated offline and classification performance of the optimized BCI model is successfully evaluated in an online SMR-BCI. Further, the effective prediction of SMR-BCI performance with physiological indicators derived from multi-channel resting-state EEG is demonstrated. The results indicate that the resting state activation patterns such as entropy and gamma power from pre-motor (fronto-central) and posterior (parietal and centro-parietal) areas, and beta power from posterior (centro-parietal) areas estimate BCI performance with minimum error. These patterns, strongly related to BCI performance, may represent certain cognitive states during rest. Findings reported in this paper imply the need for subject-specific modelling of BCI and the prediction of BCI performance using multi-channel rest-state parameters, to ensure enhanced BCI performance."
30268089,"Conventional methods of motor imagery brain computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) suffer from the limited number of samples and simplified features, so as to produce poor performances with spatial-frequency features and shallow classifiers. Alternatively, this paper applies a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) with a sliding window cropping strategy (SWCS) to signal classification of MI-BCIs. The spatial-frequency features are first extracted by the filter bank common spatial pattern (FB-CSP) algorithm, and such features are cropped by the SWCS into time slices. By extracting spatial-frequency-sequential relationships, the cropped time slices are then fed into RNN for classification. In order to overcome the memory distractions, the commonly used gated recurrent unit (GRU) and long-short term memory (LSTM) unit are applied to the RNN architecture, and experimental results are used to determine which unit is more suitable for processing EEG signals. Experimental results on common BCI benchmark datasets show that the spatial-frequency-sequential relationships outperform all other competing spatial-frequency methods. In particular, the proposed GRU-RNN architecture achieves the lowest misclassification rates on all BCI benchmark datasets. By introducing spatial-frequency-sequential relationships with cropping time slice samples, the proposed method gives a novel way to construct and model high accuracy and robustness MI-BCIs based on limited trials of EEG signals."
30260320,"Most brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) require that users perform mental tasks such as motor imagery, mental arithmetic, or music imagery to convey a message or to answer simple yes or no questions. These cognitive tasks usually have no direct association with the communicative intent, which makes them difficult for users to perform. In this paper, a 3-class intuitive BCI is presented which enables users to directly answer yes or no questions by covertly rehearsing the word 'yes' or 'no' for 15 s. The BCI also admits an equivalent duration of unconstrained rest which constitutes the third discernable task. Twelve participants each completed one offline block and six online blocks over the course of two sessions. The mean value of the change in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration during a trial was calculated for each channel and used to train a regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) classifier. By the final online block, nine out of 12 participants were performing above chance (p  <  0.001 using the binomial cumulative distribution), with a 3-class accuracy of 83.8%  ±  9.4%. Even when considering all participants, the average online 3-class accuracy over the last three blocks was 64.1 %  ±  20.6%, with only three participants scoring below chance (p  <  0.001). For most participants, channels in the left temporal and temporoparietal cortex provided the most discriminative information. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an online 3-class imagined speech BCI. Our findings suggest that imagined speech can be used as a reliable activation task for selected users for development of more intuitive BCIs for communication."
30215610,"The objective of this work is to present gumpy, a new free and open source Python toolbox designed for hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI). Gumpy provides state-of-the-art algorithms and includes a rich selection of signal processing methods that have been employed by the BCI community over the last 20 years. In addition, a wide range of classification methods that span from classical machine learning algorithms to deep neural network models are provided. Gumpy can be used for both EEG and EMG biosignal analysis, visualization, real-time streaming and decoding. The usage of the toolbox was demonstrated through two different offline example studies, namely movement prediction from EEG motor imagery, and the decoding of natural grasp movements with the applied finger forces from surface EMG (sEMG) signals. Additionally, gumpy was used for real-time control of a robot arm using steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) as well as for real-time prosthetic hand control using sEMG. Overall, obtained results with the gumpy toolbox are comparable or better than previously reported results on the same datasets. Gumpy is a free and open source software, which allows end-users to perform online hybrid BCIs and provides different techniques for processing and decoding of EEG and EMG signals. More importantly, the achieved results reveal that gumpy's deep learning toolbox can match or outperform the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy. This can therefore enable BCI researchers to develop more robust decoding algorithms using novel techniques and hence chart a route ahead for new BCI improvements."
30185802,"Currently the most common imagery task used in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) is motor imagery, asking a user to imagine moving a part of the body. This study investigates the possibility to build BCIs based on another kind of mental imagery, namely ""visual imagery"". We study to what extent can we distinguish alternative mental processes of observing visual stimuli and imagining it to obtain EEG-based BCIs. Per trial, we instructed each of 26 users who participated in the study to observe a visual cue of one of two predefined images (a flower or a hammer) and then imagine the same cue, followed by rest. We investigated if we can differentiate between the different subtrial types from the EEG alone, as well as detect which image was shown in the trial. We obtained the following classifier performances: (i) visual imagery vs. visual observation task (71% of classification accuracy), (ii) visual observation task towards different visual stimuli (classifying one observation cue versus another observation cue with an accuracy of 61%) and (iii) resting vs. observation/imagery (77% of accuracy between imagery task versus resting state, and the accuracy of 75% between observation task versus resting state). Our results show that the presence of visual imagery and specifically related alpha power changes are useful to broaden the range of BCI control strategies."
30172725,"Pairing cortical and peripheral input during motor imagery (MI)-related sensorimotor desynchronization (ERD) modulates corticospinal excitability at the cortical representation (hotspot) of the imagined movement. To determine the effects of this associative stimulation protocol on the cortical motor map beyond the hotspot. In healthy subjects, peripheral stimulation through passive hand opening by a robotic orthosis and single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to the respective cortical motor representation were applied in a brain-machine interface environment. State-dependency was investigated by concurrent, delayed or non-specific stimulation with respect to ERD in the beta-band (16-22 Hz) during MI of finger extension. Concurrent stimulation led to increased excitability of an extended motor map. Delayed and non-specific stimulation led to heterogeneous changes, i.e., opposite patterns of increased excitability in either the center or the periphery of the motor map. These results could be instrumental in closed-loop, state-dependent stimulation in the context of neurorehabilitation."
30172003,"Bridging between brain activity and machine control, brain-computer interface (BCI) can be employed to activate distributed neural circuits implicated in a specific aspect of motor control. Using a motor imagery-based BCI paradigm, we previously found a disinhibition within the primary motor cortex contralateral to the imagined movement, as evidenced by event-related desynchronization (ERD) of oscillatory cortical activity. Yet it is unclear whether this BCI approach does selectively facilitate corticomotor representations targeted by the imagery. To address this question, we used brain state-dependent transcranial magnetic stimulation while participants performed kinesthetic motor imagery of wrist movements with their right hand and received online visual feedback of the ERD. Single and paired-pulse magnetic stimulation were given to the left primary motor cortex at a low or high level of ERD to assess intracortical excitability. While intracortical facilitation showed no modulation by ERD, short-latency intracortical inhibition was reduced the higher the ERD. Intracortical disinhibition was only found in the agonist muscle targeted by motor imagery at high ERD level, but not in the antagonist muscle. Single pulse motor-evoked potential was also increased the higher the ERD. However, at high ERD level, this facilitatory effect on overall corticospinal excitability was not selective to the agonist muscle. Analogous results were found in two independent experiments, in which participants either performed kinesthetic motor imagery of wrist extension or flexion. Our results showed that motor imagery-based BCI can selectively disinhibit the corticomotor output to the agonist muscle, enabling effector-specific training in patients with motor paralysis."
30154834,"Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a rapidly developing technology that aims to support individuals suffering from various disabilities and, ultimately, improve everyday quality of life. Sensorimotor rhythm-based BCIs have demonstrated remarkable results in controlling virtual or physical external devices but they still face a number of challenges and limitations. Main challenges include multiple degrees-of-freedom control, accuracy, and robustness. In this work, we develop a multiclass BCI decoding algorithm that uses electroencephalography (EEG) source imaging, a technique that maps scalp potentials to cortical activations, to compensate for low spatial resolution of EEG. Spatial features were extracted using Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) filters in the cortical source space from a number of selected Regions of Interest (ROIs). Classification was performed through an ensemble model, based on individual ROI classification models. The evaluation was performed on the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a, which features 4 motor imagery classes from 9 participants. Our results revealed a mean accuracy increase of 5.6% with respect to the conventional application method of CSP on sensors. Neuroanatomical constraints and prior neurophysiological knowledge play an important role in developing source space-based BCI algorithms. Feature selection and classifier characteristics of our implementation will be explored to raise performance to current state-of-the-art."
30101753,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) equips humans with the ability to control computers and technical devices mentally. However, the enormous data and the existing irrelevant features of the electrocorticogram signal limit the performance of the classifier. To address these problems, a novel signal processing framework for a binary motor imagery-based BCI system (MI-BCI) is proposed in this paper. Stockwell transform and Bayesian linear discriminant analysis were applied to feature extraction and classification, respectively, and a genetic algorithm (GA) was used in the process of feature selection to extract the most relevant features for classification. The superiority of the algorithm is demonstrated through test results based on the BCI Competition III dataset I. By comparing the processes with or without feature selection, the performance of the classification was proven to improve using the GA. By adjusting the parameters of the GA, the best feature set (selected 48.6% features) was selected to achieve classification sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy of 94%, 98%, 97.9%, and 96%, respectively, exceeding the results of the existing state-of-the art algorithms. As the proposed method can reduce the number of features and select the best feature set, its classification performance was improved and the classification time was shortened; thus, it can be applied to various BCI systems."
30101383,"Multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) commands are required for a brain-actuated virtual automatic car, which makes the brain-computer interface (BCI) control strategy a big challenge. In order to solve the challenging issue, a mixed model of BCI combining P300 potentials and motor imagery had been realized in our previous study. However, compared with single model BCI, more training procedures are needed for the mixed model and more mental workload for users to bear. In the present study, we propose a multiple patterns of motor imagery (MPMI) BCI method, which is based on the traditional two patterns of motor imagery. Our motor imagery BCI approach had been extended to multiple patterns: right-hand motor imagery, left-hand motor imagery, foot motor imagery, and both hands motor imagery resulting in turning right, turning left, acceleration, and deceleration for a virtual automatic car control. Ten healthy subjects participated in online experiments, the experimental results not only show the efficiency of our proposed MPMI-BCI strategy but also indicate that those users can control the virtual automatic car spontaneously and efficiently without any other visual attention. Furthermore, the metric of path length optimality ratio (1.23) is very encouraging and the time optimality ratio (1.28) is especially remarkable.

30087594,"In order to improve the activation of the mirror neuron system and the ability of the visual-cued motor imagery further, the multi-stimuli-cued unilateral lower limb motor imagery is studied in this paper. The visual-auditory evoked pathway is proposed and the sensory process is studied. To analyze the visual-auditory interactions, the kinesthetic motor imagery with the visual-auditory stimulus, visual stimulus and no stimulus are involved. The motor-related rhythm suppression is applied on quantitative evaluation. To explore the statistical sensory process, the causal relationships among the functional areas and the event-related potentials are investigated. The results have demonstrated the outstanding performances of the visual-auditory evoked motor imagery on the improvement of the mirror neuron system activation and the motor imagery ability. Besides, the abundant information interactions among functional areas and the positive impacts of the auditory stimulus in the motor and the visual areas have been revealed. The possibility that the sensory processes evoked by the visual-auditory interactions differ from the one elicited by kinesthetic motor imagery, has also been indicated. This study will promisingly offer an efficient way to motor rehabilitation, thus favorable for hemiparesis and partial paralysis patients."
30071853,"One of the most promising applications for electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain computer interface is for stroke rehabilitation. Implemented as a standalone motor imagery (MI) training system or as part of a rehabilitation robotic system, many studies have shown benefits of using them to restore motor control in stroke patients. Hand movements have widely been chosen as MI tasks. Although potentially more challenging to analyze, wrist and forearm movement such as wrist flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination should also be considered for MI tasks, because these movements are part of the main exercises given to patients in conventional stroke rehabilitation. This paper will evaluate the effectiveness of such movements for MI tasks. Three hand and wrist movement tasks which were hand opening/closing, wrist flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination were chosen as motor imagery tasks for both hands. Eleven subjects participated in the experiment. All of them completed hand opening/closing task session. Ten subjects completed two MI task sessions which were hand opening/closing and wrist flexion/extension. Five subjects completed all three MI tasks sessions. Each MI task comprised 8 sessions spanning a 4 weeks period. For classification, feature extraction based on common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm was used. Two types were implemented, one with conventional CSP (termed WB) and one with an increase number of features achieved by filtering EEG data into five bands (termed FB). Classification was done by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM). Eight-fold cross validation was applied on EEG data. LDA and SVM gave comparable classification accuracy. FB achieved significantly higher classification accuracy compared to WB. The accuracy of classifying wrist flexion/extension task were higher than that of classifying hand opening/closing task in all subjects. Classifying forearm pronation/supination task achieved higher accuracy than classifying hand opening/closing task in most subjects but achieved lower accuracy than classifying wrist flexion/extension task in all subjects. Significant improvements of classification accuracy were found in nine subjects when considering individual sessions of experiments of all MI tasks. The results of classifying hand opening/closing task and wrist flexion/extension task were comparable to the results of classifying hand opening/closing task and forearm pronation/supination task. Classification accuracy of wrist flexion/extension task and forearm pronation/supination task was lower than those of hand movement tasks and wrist movement tasks. High classification accuracy of the three MI tasks support the possibility of using EEG-based stroke rehabilitation system with these movements. Either LDA or SVM can equally be chosen as a classifier since the difference of their accuracies is not statistically significant. Significantly higher classification accuracy made FB more suitable for classifying MI task compared to WB. More training sessions could potentially lead to better accuracy as evident in most subjects in this experiment."
30068128,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems establish a direct communication channel from the brain to an output device. As the basis of BCIs, recognizing motor imagery activities poses a considerable challenge to signal processing due to the complex and non-stationary characteristics. This paper introduces an optimal and intelligent method for motor imagery BCIs. Because of the robustness to noise, wavelet packet decomposition and common spatial pattern (CSP) methods were implemented to reduce the dimensions of preprocessed signals. And a novel and efficient classifier projection extreme learning machine (PELM) was employed to recognize the labels of electroencephalogram signals. Experiments have been performed on the BCI Competition Dataset to demonstrate the superiority of wavelet-CSP in BCI and the outperformance of the PELM-based method. Results show that the average recognition rate of PELM approaches approximately 70%, while the optimal rate of other methods is 72%, whose training time and classification time are relatively longer as 11.00 ms and 11.66 ms, respectively, compared with 4.75 ms and 4.87 ms obtained by using the proposed BCI system."
30054779,"Feature extraction and classification is a vital part in motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system. Traditional deep learning (DL) methods usually perform better with more labeled training samples. Unfortunately, the labeled samples are usually scarce for electroencephalography (EEG) data, while unlabeled samples are available in large quantity and easy to collect. In addition, traditional DL algorithms are notoriously time-consuming for the training process. To address these issues, a novel method of hierarchical semi-supervised extreme learning machine (HSS-ELM) is proposed in this paper and applied for motor imagery (MI) task classification. Firstly, the deep architecture of hierarchical ELM (H-ELM) approach is employed for feature learning automatically, and then these new high-level features are classified using the semi-supervised ELM (SS-ELM) algorithm which can exploit the information from both labeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments were conducted on some benchmark datasets and EEG datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with several state-of-the-art methods, including SVM, ELM, SAE, H-ELM, and SS-ELM, our HSS-ELM method can achieve better classification accuracy, a mean kappa value of 0.7945 and 0.5701 across all subjects in the training and evaluation sessions of BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a, respectively. Finally, it comes to the conclusion that the proposed method has achieved superior performance for feature extraction and classification of EEG signals.

30021931,"In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) system that measures electrical brain activity as well as cerebral blood velocity using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound (fTCD) respectively in response to flickering mental rotation (MR) and flickering word generation (WG) cognitive tasks as well as a fixation cross that represents the baseline. This work extends our previous approach, in which we showed that motor imagery induces simultaneous changes in EEG and fTCD to enable task discrimination; and hence, provides a design approach for a hybrid BCI. Here, we show that instead of using motor imagery, the proposed visual stimulation technique enables the design of an EEG-fTCD based BCI with higher accuracy. Features based on the power spectrum of EEG and fTCD signals were calculated. Mutual information and support vector machines were used for feature selection and classification purposes. EEG-fTCD combination outperformed EEG by 4.05% accuracy for MR versus baseline problem and by 5.81% accuracy for WG versus baseline problem. An average accuracy of 92.38% was achieved for MR versus WG problem using the hybrid combination. Average transmission rates of 4.39, 3.92, and 5.60 bits min<sup>-1</sup> were obtained for MR versus baseline, WG versus baseline, and MR versus WG problems respectively. In terms of accuracy, the current visual presentation outperforms the motor imagery visual presentation we designed before for the EEG-fTCD system by 10% accuracy for task versus task problem. Moreover, the proposed system outperforms the state of the art hybrid EEG-fNIRS BCIs in terms of accuracy and/or information transfer rate. Even though there are still limitations of the proposed system, such promising results show that the proposed hybrid system is a feasible candidate for real-time BCIs."
30012780,"In the recent past, training systems using an interactive virtual environment have been introduced to neurorehabilitation. Such systems can be applied to encourage purposeful limb movements and will increasingly be used at home by the individual patient. Therefore, an integrated valid and reliable assessment tool on the basis of such a system to monitor the recovery process would be an essential asset. The aim of the study is to evaluate usability, feasibility and validity of the digital version of the Action Research Arm Test using the Bi-Manu-Trainer system as a platform. Additionally, the feasibility and usability of the implementation of action observation and motor imagery tasks into the Bi-Manu-Trainer software will be evaluated. This observational study is planned as a single-arm trial for testing the new assessment and the action observation and motor imagery training module. Therefore, 75 patients with Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain injury or Guillain-Barré syndrome will be included. 30 out of the 75 patients will additionally take part in a 4-week training on the enhanced Bi-Manu-Trainer system. Primary outcomes will be the score on the System Usability Scale and the correlation between the conventional and digital Action Research Arm Test scores. Secondary outcomes will be hand dexterity, upper limb activities of daily living and quality of life. We hypothesise that the digital Action Research Arm Test assessment is a valid and essential tool and that it is feasible to incorporate action observation and motor imagery into Bi-Manu-Trainer practice. The results are expected to give recommendations for necessary modifications and might also contribute knowledge concerning the application of action observation and motor imagery tasks using a training system such as the Bi-Manu-Trainer.

30002615,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology allowing patients with severe motor dysfunctions to use their electroencephalographic signals to create a communication channel to control devices. The objective of this paper is to study the feasibility of continuous and switch control modes for a brain-controlled wheelchair (BCW) using sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) modulated through a right-hand motor imagery task. Previous studies, which used a continuous navigation control with SMR, have reported the difficulty of maintaining the motor imagery task for a long time, especially for the forward command. The switch control has been presented as a proposal that may help to solve this issue since this task is only used temporary for either disabling or enabling the movement. Regarding the methodology, 10 of 15 able-bodied users, who had overcome the criterion of 30% error rate in the calibration phase, controlled the BCW using both paradigms. The navigation tasks consisted of a straight path divided in five sections: in three of them the users had to move forward, and in the other two the users had to maintain their position. To assess user performance in the device management, a usability approach was adopted, measuring the factors of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. Then, variables related to the time employed and commands selected by the user or parameters related to the confusion matrix were applied. In addition, the scores in NASA-TLX and two <i>ad hoc</i> questionnaires were considered to discuss the user experience controlling the wheelchair. Despite the results showed that the best system for a specific user relies on his/her abilities and preferences, the switch control mode obtained better accuracy (0.59 ± 0.17 for continuous and 0.72 ± 0.05 for switch). Furthermore, the switch paradigm can be recommended for the advance sections as with it users could complete the advance sections in less time (42.2 ± 28.7 s for continuous and 15.47 ± 3.43 s for switch), while the continuous mode seems to be better at keeping the wheelchair stopped (42.45 ± 16.01 s for continuous and 24.35 ± 10.94 s for switch)."
29994667,"Common spatial pattern (CSP)-based spatial filtering has been most popularly applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) feature extraction for motor imagery (MI) classification in brain-computer interface (BCI) application. The effectiveness of CSP is highly affected by the frequency band and time window of EEG segments. Although numerous algorithms have been designed to optimize the spectral bands of CSP, most of them selected the time window in a heuristic way. This is likely to result in a suboptimal feature extraction since the time period when the brain responses to the mental tasks occurs may not be accurately detected. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, namely temporally constrained sparse group spatial pattern (TSGSP), for the simultaneous optimization of filter bands and time window within CSP to further boost classification accuracy of MI EEG. Specifically, spectrum-specific signals are first derived by bandpass filtering from raw EEG data at a set of overlapping filter bands. Each of the spectrum-specific signals is further segmented into multiple subseries using sliding window approach. We then devise a joint sparse optimization of filter bands and time windows with temporal smoothness constraint to extract robust CSP features under a multitask learning framework. A linear support vector machine classifier is trained on the optimized EEG features to accurately identify the MI tasks. An experimental study is implemented on three public EEG datasets (BCI Competition III dataset IIIa, BCI Competition IV datasets IIa, and BCI Competition IV dataset IIb) to validate the effectiveness of TSGSP in comparison to several other competing methods. Superior classification performance (averaged accuracies are 88.5%, 83.3%, and 84.3% for the three datasets, respectively) based on the experimental results confirms that the proposed algorithm is a promising candidate for performance improvement of MI-based BCIs."
29994075,"Deep learning (DL) methods and architectures have been the state-of-the-art classification algorithms for computer vision and natural language processing problems. However, the successful application of these methods in motor imagery (MI) brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), in order to boost classification performance, is still limited. In this paper, we propose a classification framework for MI data by introducing a new temporal representation of the data and also utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for classification. The new representation is generated from modifying the filter-bank common spatial patterns method, and the CNN is designed and optimized accordingly for the representation. Our framework outperforms the best classification method in the literature on the BCI competition IV-2a 4-class MI data set by 7% increase in average subject accuracy. Furthermore, by studying the convolutional weights of the trained networks, we gain an insight into the temporal characteristics of EEG."
29994055,"A potential limitation of a motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interface (BCI) is that it usually requires a relatively long time to record sufficient electroencephalogram (EEG) data for robust classifier training. The calibration burden during data acquisition phase will most probably cause a subject to be reluctant to use a BCI system. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel sparse group representation model (SGRM) for improving the efficiency of MI-based BCI by exploiting the intersubject information. Specifically, preceded by feature extraction using common spatial pattern, a composite dictionary matrix is constructed with training samples from both the target subject and other subjects. By explicitly exploiting within-group sparse and group-wise sparse constraints, the most compact representation of a test sample of the target subject is then estimated as a linear combination of columns in the dictionary matrix. Classification is implemented by calculating the class-specific representation residual based on the significant training samples corresponding to the nonzero representation coefficients. Accordingly, the proposed SGRM method effectively reduces the required training samples from the target subject due to auxiliary data available from other subjects. With two public EEG data sets, extensive experimental comparisons are carried out between SGRM and other state-of-the-art approaches. Superior classification performance of our method using 40 trials of the target subject for model calibration (Averaged accuracy = 78.2%, Kappa = 0.57 and Averaged accuracy = 77.7%, Kappa = 0.55 for the two data sets, respectively) indicates its promising potential for improving the practicality of MI-based BCI."
29973645,"Long calibration time hinders the feasibility of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). If other subjects' data were used for training the classifier, BCI-based neurofeedback practice could start without the initial calibration. Here, we compare methods for inter-subject decoding of left- vs. right-hand motor imagery (MI) from MEG and EEG. Six methods were tested on data involving MEG and EEG measurements of healthy participants. Inter-subject decoders were trained on subjects showing good within-subject accuracy, and tested on all subjects, including poor performers. Three methods were based on Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), and three others on logistic regression with l<sub>1</sub> - or l<sub>2,1</sub> -norm regularization. The decoding accuracy was evaluated using (1) MI and (2) passive movements (PM) for training, separately for MEG and EEG. With MI training, the best accuracies across subjects (mean 70.6% for MEG, 67.7% for EEG) were obtained using multi-task learning (MTL) with logistic regression and l<sub>2,1</sub>-norm regularization. MEG yielded slightly better average accuracies than EEG. With PM training, none of the inter-subject methods yielded above chance level (58.7%) accuracy. In conclusion, MTL and training with other subject's MI is efficient for inter-subject decoding of MI. Passive movements of other subjects are likely suboptimal for training the MI classifiers."
29938940,"Event-related desynchronization (ERD) is the basic feature of electroencephalogram (EEG), and the brain-computer interface based on motor imagery (MI-BCI) with the foundation of the analysis of ERD is of great significance in motor function recovery. The valid ERD characteristics extracted from EEG are the key to the performance of the BCI, so the study of which kind of stimulation mode can prompt subjects to generate more obvious characteristics of ERD is crucial. Four different stimulation modes are designed in this paper, and the effects of motion imagery tasks under static text stimulation, grip video stimulation, serial motion video stimulation of fingers as well as serial motion video stimulation of fingers with sound on the characteristics of ERD are analyzed. Combining the analysis of time-frequency spectrum, the power spectral density curve, ERD value and brain topographic map, it is shown that the ERD under serial motion video stimulation of fingers and serial motion video stimulation of fingers with sound modes is much stronger and has wider range of activation, and the BCI based on the analysis of ERD will have a better effect on practical application. As a result, the recognition and acceptance of the users of BCI system are improved in some extent."
29922477,"Phase synchronisation between different neural groups is considered an important source of information to understand the underlying mechanisms of brain cognition. This Letter investigated phase-synchronisation patterns from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded from ten healthy participants performing motor imagery (MI) tasks using schematic emotional faces as stimuli. These phase-synchronised states, named synchrostates, are specific for each cognitive task performed by the user. The maximum and minimum number of occurrence states were selected for each subject and task to extract the connectivity network measures based on graph theory to feed a set of classification algorithms. Two MI tasks were successfully classified with the highest accuracy of 85% with corresponding sensitivity and specificity of 85%. In this work, not only the performance of different supervised learning techniques was studied, as well as the optimal subset of features to obtain the best discrimination rates. The robustness of this classification method for MI tasks indicates the possibility of expanding its use for online classification of the brain-computer interface (BCI) systems."
29903485,"Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method that measures and records the electrical activity of the human brain. These biomedical signals are currently being actively used in many research fields and have a wide range of potential uses in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The main aim of the present work is to improve the classification of EEG patterns for EEG-based BCI systems. In this paper, we presented a classification approach for EEG-based BCIs. For this purpose, in the training stage, 2-D representations of signals were extracted and a quasi-probabilistic learning model was built for binary classification. In the testing stage, the estimation of class membership probability was performed with an untrained sub-data set. To confirm the validity of the proposed method, we conducted experiments on the BCI Competition 2003 Data Sets (Ia and Ib). The classification performances were evaluated for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F-measure measurements using the five-fold leave-one-out cross-validation technique ten times. The proposed method yielded an average classification accuracy of 95.54% (with sensitivity and specificity of 100.00% and 91.80% respectively) for Data Set Ia and accuracy of 72.37% (with sensitivity and specificity of 75.76% and 69.77% respectively) for Data Set Ib, which are the highest rates ever reported for both data sets. It is apparent from the results that the proposed method has potential and can assist in the development of effective EEG-based BCIs. The advantage of this method lies in its relatively simple algorithm and easy computational implementation. The experimental results also showed that the selection of relevant channels is an important step in developing efficient EEG-based BCI systems."
29872420,"Qualitative clinical assessments of the recovery of awareness after severe brain injury require an assessor to differentiate purposeful behavior from spontaneous behavior. As many such behaviors are minimal and inconsistent, behavioral assessments are susceptible to diagnostic errors. Advanced neuroimaging tools can bypass behavioral responsiveness and reveal evidence of covert awareness and cognition within the brains of some patients, thus providing a means for more accurate diagnoses, more accurate prognoses, and, in some instances, facilitated communication. The majority of reports to date have employed the neuroimaging methods of functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and electroencephalography (EEG). However, each neuroimaging method has its own advantages and disadvantages (e.g., signal resolution, accessibility, etc.). Here, we describe a burgeoning technique of non-invasive optical neuroimaging-functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-and review its potential to address the clinical challenges of prolonged disorders of consciousness. We also outline the potential for simultaneous EEG to complement the fNIRS signal and suggest the future directions of research that are required in order to realize its clinical potential."
29867320,"EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are becoming a new tool for neurorehabilitation. BCIs are used to help stroke patients to improve the functional capability of the impaired limbs, and to communicate and assess the level of consciousness in Disorder of Consciousness (DoC) patients. BCIs based on a motor imagery paradigm typically require a training period to adapt the system to each user's brain, and the BCI then creates and uses a classifier created with the acquired EEG. The quality of this classifier relies on amount of data used for training. More data can improve the classifier, but also increases the training time, which can be especially problematic for some patients. Training time might be reduced by creating new artificial frames by applying Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) on the EEG frames and mixing their Intrinsic Mode Function (IMFs). The purpose of this study is to explore the use of artificial EEG frames as replacements for some real ones by comparing classifiers trained with some artificial frames to classifiers trained with only real data. Results showed that, in some subjects, it is possible to replace up to 50% of frames with artificial data, which reduces training time from 720 to 360 s. In the remaining subjects, at least 12.5% of the real EEG frames could be replaced, reducing the training time by 90 s. Moreover, the method can be used to replace EEG frames that contain artifact, which reduces the impact of rejecting data with artifact. The method was also tested on an out of sample scenario with the best subjects from a public database, who yielded very good results using a frame collection with 87.5% artificial frames. These initial results with healthy users need to be further explored with patients' data, along with research into alternative IMF mixing strategies and using other BCI paradigms."
29867307,"Multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used in typical brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. In general, a number of parameters are essential for a EEG classification algorithm due to redundant features involved in EEG signals. However, the generalization of the EEG method is often adversely affected by the model complexity, considerably coherent with its number of undetermined parameters, further leading to heavy overfitting. To decrease the complexity and improve the generalization of EEG method, we present a novel <i>l</i><sub>1</sub>-norm-based approach to combine the decision value obtained from each EEG channel directly. By extracting the information from different channels on independent frequency bands (FB) with l1-norm regularization, the method proposed fits the training data with much less parameters compared to common spatial pattern (CSP) methods in order to reduce overfitting. Moreover, an effective and efficient solution to minimize the optimization object is proposed. The experimental results on dataset IVa of BCI competition III and dataset I of BCI competition IV show that, the proposed method contributes to high classification accuracy and increases generalization performance for the classification of MI EEG. As the training set ratio decreases from 80 to 20%, the average classification accuracy on the two datasets changes from 85.86 and 86.13% to 84.81 and 76.59%, respectively. The classification performance and generalization of the proposed method contribute to the practical application of MI based BCI systems."
29860376,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide access to augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices using neurological activity alone without voluntary movements. As with traditional AAC access methods, BCI performance may be influenced by the cognitive-sensory-motor and motor imagery profiles of those who use these devices. Therefore, we propose a person-centered, feature matching framework consistent with clinical AAC best practices to ensure selection of the most appropriate BCI technology to meet individuals' communication needs. The proposed feature matching procedure is based on the current state of the art in BCI technology and published reports on cognitive, sensory, motor, and motor imagery factors important for successful operation of BCI devices. Considerations for successful selection of BCI for accessing AAC are summarized based on interpretation from a multidisciplinary team with experience in AAC, BCI, neuromotor disorders, and cognitive assessment. The set of features that support each BCI option are discussed in a hypothetical case format to model possible transition of BCI research from the laboratory into clinical AAC applications. This procedure is an initial step toward consideration of feature matching assessment for the full range of BCI devices. Future investigations are needed to fully examine how person-centered factors influence BCI performance across devices."
29853844,"We investigated cortically mediated changes in reciprocal inhibition (RI) following motor imagery (MI) in short- and long(er)-term periods. The goals of this study were (1) to describe RI during MI in patients with chronic stroke and (2) to examine the change in RI after MI-based brain-machine interface (BMI) training. Twenty-four chronic stroke patients participated in study 1. All patients imagined wrist extension on the affected side. RI from the extensor carpi radialis to the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) was assessed using a FCR H reflex conditioning-test paradigm. We calculated the ""MI effect score on RI"" (RI value during MI divided by that at rest) and compared that score according to lesion location. RI during MI showed a significant enhancement compared with RI at rest. The MI effect score on RI in the subcortical lesion group was significantly greater than that in the cortical lesion group. Eleven stroke patients participated in study 2. All patients performed BMI training for 10 days. The MI effect score on RI at a 20 ms interstimulus interval was significantly increased after BMI compared with baseline. In conclusion, mental practice with MI may induce plastic change in spinal reciprocal inhibitory circuits in patients with stroke."
29849992,"Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have shown potential for the rehabilitation of stroke patients; however, low performance has restricted their application in clinical environments. Therefore, this work presents the implementation of a BCI system, coupled to a robotic hand orthosis and driven by hand motor imagery of healthy subjects and the paralysed hand of stroke patients. A novel processing stage was designed using a bank of temporal filters, the common spatial pattern algorithm for feature extraction and particle swarm optimisation for feature selection. Offline tests were performed for testing the proposed processing stage, and results were compared with those computed with common spatial patterns. Afterwards, online tests with healthy subjects were performed in which the orthosis was activated by the system. Stroke patients' average performance was 74.1 ± 11%. For 4 out of 6 patients, the proposed method showed a statistically significant higher performance than the common spatial pattern method. Healthy subjects' average offline and online performances were of 76.2 ± 7.6% and 70 ± 6.7, respectively. For 3 out of 8 healthy subjects, the proposed method showed a statistically significant higher performance than the common spatial pattern method. System's performance showed that it has a potential to be used for hand rehabilitation of stroke patients."
29804044,"We tested the feasibility of deploying a commercially available EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) in the intensive care unit (ICU) to detect consciousness in patients with acute disorders of consciousness (DoC) or locked-in syndrome (LIS). Ten patients (9 DoC, 1 LIS) and 10 healthy subjects (HS) were enrolled. The BCI utilized oddball auditory evoked potentials, vibrotactile evoked potentials (VTP) and motor imagery (MoI) to assess consciousness. We recorded the assessment completion rate and the time required for assessment, and we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of each paradigm for detecting behavioral signs of consciousness. All 10 patients completed the assessment, 9 of whom required less than 1 h. The LIS patient reported fatigue before the end of the session. The HS and LIS patient showed more consistent BCI responses than DoC patients, but overall there was no association between BCI responses and behavioral signs of consciousness. The system is feasible to deploy in the ICU and may confirm consciousness in acute LIS, but it was unreliable in acute DoC. The accuracy of the paradigms for detecting consciousness must be improved and the duration of the protocol should be shortened before this commercially available BCI is ready for clinical implementation in the ICU in patients with acute DoC."
29782968,"We investigated the trainability of the hemodynamic response as assessed with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during one neurofeedback (NF) session. Forty-eight participants were randomly assigned to four different groups that tried to either increase or decrease oxygenated (oxy-Hb) or deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) over the inferior frontal gyrus during imagery of swallowing movements. Deoxy-Hb could be successfully up-regulated while oxy-Hb could be successfully down-regulated during NF. Participants were not able to down-regulate deoxy-Hb or to up-regulate oxy-Hb. These results show that the natural course of oxy- and deoxy-Hb during movement imagery can be reinforced by providing real-time feedback of the corresponding NIRS parameter since deoxy-Hb generally increases and oxy-Hb decreases during imagery of swallowing. Furthermore, signal-to-noise ratio of deoxy-Hb but not of oxy-Hb improved during training. Our results provide new insights into the trainability of the hemodynamic response as assessed with NIRS and have an impact on the application of NIRS-based real-time feedback."
29768971,"We adopted a fusion approach that combines features from simultaneously recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) signals to improve classification performances in motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). We applied our approach to a group of 15 healthy subjects and found a significant classification performance enhancement as compared to standard single-modality approaches in the alpha and beta bands. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the advantage of considering multimodal approaches as complementary tools for improving the impact of noninvasive BCIs."
29747059,"Feature selection plays an important role in the field of EEG signals based motor imagery pattern classification. It is a process that aims to select an optimal feature subset from the original set. Two significant advantages involved are: lowering the computational burden so as to speed up the learning procedure and removing redundant and irrelevant features so as to improve the classification performance. Therefore, feature selection is widely employed in the classification of EEG signals in practical brain-computer interface systems. In this paper, we present a novel statistical model to select the optimal feature subset based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure, and automatically select the optimal subject-specific time segment. The proposed method comprises four successive stages: a broad frequency band filtering and common spatial pattern enhancement as preprocessing, features extraction by autoregressive model and log-variance, the Kullback-Leibler divergence based optimal feature and time segment selection and linear discriminate analysis classification. More importantly, this paper provides a potential framework for combining other feature extraction models and classification algorithms with the proposed method for EEG signals classification. Experiments on single-trial EEG signals from two public competition datasets not only demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in selecting discriminative features and time segment, but also show that the proposed method yields relatively better classification results in comparison with other competitive methods."
29746465,"This work aims at corroborating the importance and efficacy of mutual learning in motor imagery (MI) brain-computer interface (BCI) by leveraging the insights obtained through our participation in the BCI race of the Cybathlon event. We hypothesized that, contrary to the popular trend of focusing mostly on the machine learning aspects of MI BCI training, a comprehensive mutual learning methodology that reinstates the three learning pillars (at the machine, subject, and application level) as equally significant could lead to a BCI-user symbiotic system able to succeed in real-world scenarios such as the Cybathlon event. Two severely impaired participants with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI), were trained following our mutual learning approach to control their avatar in a virtual BCI race game. The competition outcomes substantiate the effectiveness of this type of training. Most importantly, the present study is one among very few to provide multifaceted evidence on the efficacy of subject learning during BCI training. Learning correlates could be derived at all levels of the interface-application, BCI output, and electroencephalography (EEG) neuroimaging-with two end-users, sufficiently longitudinal evaluation, and, importantly, under real-world and even adverse conditions."
29745536,"Multi-modal brain-computer interface and multi-modal brain function imaging are developing trends for the present and future. Aiming at multi-modal brain-computer interface based on electroencephalogram-near infrared spectroscopy (EEG-NIRS) and in order to simultaneously acquire the brain activity of motor area, an acquisition helmet by NIRS combined with EEG was designed and verified by the experiment. According to the 10-20 system or 10-20 extended system, the diameter and spacing of NIRS probe and EEG electrode, NIRS probes were aligned with C3 and C4 as the reference electrodes, and NIRS probes were placed in the middle position between EEG electrodes to simultaneously measure variations of NIRS and the corresponding variation of EEG in the same functional brain area. The clamp holder and near infrared probe were coupled by tightening a screw. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the multi-modal EEG-NIRS helmet, NIRS and EEG signals were collected from six healthy subjects during six mental tasks involving the right hand clenching force and speed motor imagery. These signals may reflect brain activity related to hand clenching force and speed motor imagery in a certain extent. The experiment showed that the EEG-NIRS helmet designed in the paper was feasible and effective. It not only could provide support for the multi-modal motor imagery brain-computer interface based on EEG-NIRS, but also was expected to provide support for multi-modal brain functional imaging based on EEG-NIRS."
29743934,"Motor-imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) commonly use the common spatial pattern (CSP) as preprocessing step before classification. The CSP method is a supervised algorithm. Therefore a lot of time-consuming training data is needed to build the model. To address this issue, one promising approach is transfer learning, which generalizes a learning model can extract discriminative information from other subjects for target classification task. To this end, we propose a transfer kernel CSP (TKCSP) approach to learn a domain-invariant kernel by directly matching distributions of source subjects and target subjects. The dataset IVa of BCI Competition III is used to demonstrate the validity by our proposed methods. In the experiment, we compare the classification performance of the TKCSP against CSP, CSP for subject-to-subject transfer (CSP SJ-to-SJ), regularizing CSP (RCSP), stationary subspace CSP (ssCSP), multitask CSP (mtCSP), and the combined mtCSP and ssCSP (ss + mtCSP) method. The results indicate that the superior mean classification performance of TKCSP can achieve 81.14%, especially in case of source subjects with fewer number of training samples. Comprehensive experimental evidence on the dataset verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed TKCSP approach over several state-of-the-art methods."
29740302,"Motor imagery (MI), a covert cognitive process where an action is mentally simulated but not actually performed, could be used as an effective neurorehabilitation tool for motor function improvement or recovery. Recent approaches employing brain-computer/brain-machine interfaces to provide online feedback of the MI during rehabilitation training have promising rehabilitation outcomes. In this study, we examined whether participants could volitionally recall MI-related brain activation patterns when guided using neurofeedback (NF) during training. The participants' performance was compared to that without NF. We hypothesized that participants would be able to consistently generate the relevant activation pattern associated with the MI task during training with NF compared to that without NF. To assess activation consistency, we used the performance of classifiers trained to discriminate MI-related brain activation patterns. Our results showed significantly higher predictive values of MI-related activation patterns during training with NF. Additionally, this improvement in the classification performance tends to be associated with the activation of middle temporal gyrus/inferior occipital gyrus, a region associated with visual motion processing, suggesting the importance of performance monitoring during MI task training. Taken together, these findings suggest that the efficacy of MI training, in terms of generating consistent brain activation patterns relevant to the task, can be enhanced by using NF as a mechanism to enable participants to volitionally recall task-related brain activation patterns."
29738806,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a new communication pathway for users with neurological deficiencies. The implementation of a BCI system requires complex electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing including filtering, feature extraction and classification algorithms. Most of current BCI systems are implemented on personal computers. Therefore, there is a great interest in implementing BCI on embedded platforms to meet system specifications in terms of time response, cost effectiveness, power consumption, and accuracy. This article presents an embedded-BCI (EBCI) system based on a Stratix-IV field programmable gate array. The proposed system relays on the weighted overlap-add (WOLA) algorithm to perform dynamic filtering of EEG-signals by analyzing the event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS). The EEG-signals are classified, using the linear discriminant analysis algorithm, based on their spatial features. The proposed system performs fast classification within a time delay of 0.430 s/trial, achieving an average accuracy of 76.80% according to an offline approach and 80.25% using our own recording. The estimated power consumption of the prototype is approximately 0.7 W. Results show that the proposed EBCI system reduces the overall classification error rate for the three datasets of the BCI-competition by 5% compared to other similar implementations. Moreover, experiment shows that the proposed system maintains a high accuracy rate with a short processing time, a low power consumption, and a low cost. Performing dynamic filtering of EEG-signals using WOLA increases the recognition rate of ERD/ERS patterns of motor imagery brain activity. This approach allows to develop a complete prototype of a EBCI system that achieves excellent accuracy rates."
29737970,"When designing multiclass motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI), a so-called tangent space mapping (TSM) method utilizing the geometric structure of covariance matrices is an effective technique. This paper aims to introduce a method using TSM for finding accurate operational frequency bands related brain activities associated with MI tasks. A multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is decomposed into multiple subbands, and tangent features are then estimated on each subband. A mutual information analysis-based effective algorithm is implemented to select subbands containing features capable of improving motor imagery classification accuracy. Thus obtained features of selected subbands are combined to get feature space. A principal component analysis-based approach is employed to reduce the features dimension and then the classification is accomplished by a support vector machine (SVM). Offline analysis demonstrates the proposed multiband tangent space mapping with subband selection (MTSMS) approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods. It acheives the highest average classification accuracy for all datasets (BCI competition dataset 2a, IIIa, IIIb, and dataset JK-HH1). The increased classification accuracy of MI tasks with the proposed MTSMS approach can yield effective implementation of BCI. The mutual information-based subband selection method is implemented to tune operation frequency bands to represent actual motor imagery tasks."
29733940,"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are one of the widely used classifiers in the brain-computer interface (BCI) systems-based on noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Among the different ANN architectures, the most commonly applied for BCI classifiers is the multilayer perceptron (MLP). When appropriately designed with optimal number of neuron layers and number of neurons per layer, the ANN can act as a universal approximator. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG signal data, overtraining problem may become an inherent issue, causing these universal approximators to fail in real-time applications. In this study we introduce a higher order neural network, namely the functional link neural network (FLNN) as a classifier for motor imagery (MI)-based BCI systems, to remedy the drawbacks in MLP. We compare the proposed method with competing classifiers such as linear decomposition analysis, naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbours, support vector machine and three MLP architectures. Two multi-class benchmark datasets from the BCI competitions are used. Common spatial pattern algorithm is utilized for feature extraction to build classification models. FLNN reports the highest average Kappa value over multiple subjects for both the BCI competition datasets, under similarly preprocessed data and extracted features. Further, statistical comparison results over multiple subjects show that the proposed FLNN classification method yields the best performance among the competing classifiers. Findings from this study imply that the proposed method, which has less computational complexity compared to the MLP, can be implemented effectively in practical MI-based BCI systems."
29714718,"In this manuscript, we consider factors that may affect the design of a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI). We combine neural correlates of natural movements and interaction error-related potentials (ErrP) to perform a 3D reaching task, focusing on the impact that such factors have on the evoked ErrP signatures and in their classification. Users attempted to control a 3D virtual interface that simulated their own hand, to reach and grasp two different objects. Three factors of interest were modulated during the experimentation: (1) execution speed of the grasping, (2) type of grasping and (3) mental strategy (motor imagery or real motion) used to produce motor commands. Thirteen healthy subjects carried out the protocol. The peaks and latencies of the ErrP were analyzed for the different factors as well as the classification performance. ErrP are evoked for erroneous commands decoded from neural correlates of natural movements. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) analyses revealed that latency and magnitude of the most characteristic ErrP peaks were significantly influenced by the speed at which the grasping was executed, but not the type of grasp. This resulted in an greater accuracy of single-trial decoding of errors for fast movements (75.65%) compared to slow ones (68.99%). Understanding the effects of combining paradigms is a first step to design hybrid BCI that optimize decoding accuracy and can be deployed in motor substitution and neuro-rehabilitation applications."
29713262,"Superior feature extraction, channel selection and classification methods are essential for designing electroencephalography (EEG) classification frameworks. However, the performance of most frameworks is limited by their improper channel selection methods and too specifical design, leading to high computational complexity, non-convergent procedure and narrow expansibility. In this paper, to remedy these drawbacks, we propose a fast, open EEG classification framework centralized by EEG feature compression, low-dimensional representation, and convergent iterative channel ranking. First, to reduce the complexity, we use data clustering to compress the EEG features channel-wise, packing the high-dimensional EEG signal, and endowing them with numerical signatures. Second, to provide easy access to alternative superior methods, we structurally represent each EEG trial in a feature vector with its corresponding numerical signature. Thus, the recorded signals of many trials shrink to a low-dimensional structural matrix compatible with most pattern recognition methods. Third, a series of effective iterative feature selection approaches with theoretical convergence is introduced to rank the EEG channels and remove redundant ones, further accelerating the EEG classification process and ensuring its stability. Finally, a classical linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model is employed to classify a single EEG trial with selected channels. Experimental results on two real world brain-computer interface (BCI) competition datasets demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art methods."
29689307,"Motor imagery (MI) has been largely studied as a way to enhance motor learning and to restore motor functions. Although it is agreed that users should emphasize kinesthetic imagery during MI, recordings of MI brain patterns are not sufficiently reliable for many subjects. It has been suggested that the usage of somatosensory feedback would be more suitable than standardly used visual feedback to enhance MI brain patterns. However, somatosensory feedback should not interfere with the recorded MI brain pattern. In this study we propose a novel feedback modality to guide subjects during MI based on sensory threshold neuromuscular electrical stimulation (St-NMES). St-NMES depolarizes sensory and motor axons without eliciting any muscular contraction. We hypothesize that St-NMES does not induce detectable ERD brain patterns and fosters MI performance. Twelve novice subjects were included in a cross-over design study. We recorded their EEG, comparing St-NMES with visual feedback during MI or resting tasks. We found that St-NMES not only induced significantly larger desynchronization over sensorimotor areas (p<0.05) but also significantly enhanced MI brain connectivity patterns. Moreover, classification accuracy and stability were significantly higher with St-NMES. Importantly, St-NMES alone did not induce detectable artifacts, but rather the changes in the detected patterns were due to an increased MI performance. Our findings indicate that St-NMES is a promising feedback in order to foster MI performance and cold be used for BMI online applications."
29681924,"A widely discussed paradigm for brain-computer interface (BCI) is the motor imagery task using noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) modality. It often requires long training session for collecting a large amount of EEG data which makes user exhausted. One of the approaches to shorten this session is utilizing the instances from past users to train the learner for the novel user. In this work, direct transferring from past users is investigated and applied to multiclass motor imagery BCI. Then, active learning (AL) driven informative instance transfer learning has been attempted for multiclass BCI. Informative instance transfer shows better performance than direct instance transfer which reaches the benchmark using a reduced amount of training data (49% less) in cases of 6 out of 9 subjects. However, none of these methods has superior performance for all subjects in general. To get a generic transfer learning framework for BCI, an optimal ensemble of informative and direct transfer methods is designed and applied. The optimized ensemble outperforms both direct and informative transfer method for all subjects except one in BCI competition IV multiclass motor imagery dataset. It achieves the benchmark performance for 8 out of 9 subjects using average 75% less training data. Thus, the requirement of large training data for the new user is reduced to a significant amount."
29681792,"Motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (BCI) using electroencephalography (EEG) has demonstrated promising applications by directly decoding users' movement related mental intention. The selection of control signals, e.g., the channel configuration and decoding algorithm, plays a vital role in the online performance and progressing of BCI control. While several offline analyses report the effect of these factors on BCI accuracy for a single session-performance increases asymptotically by increasing the number of channels, saturates, and then decreases-no online study, to the best of our knowledge, has yet been performed to compare for a single session or across training. The purpose of the current study is to assess, in a group of forty-five subjects, the effect of channel number and decoding method on the progression of BCI performance across multiple training sessions and the corresponding neurophysiological changes. The 45 subjects were divided into three groups using Laplacian Filtering (LAP/S) with nine channels, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP/L) with 40 channels and CSP (CSP/S) with nine channels for online decoding. At the first training session, subjects using CSP/L displayed no significant difference compared to CSP/S but a higher average BCI performance over those using LAP/S. Despite the average performance when using the LAP/S method was initially lower, but LAP/S displayed improvement over first three sessions, whereas the other two groups did not. Additionally, analysis of the recorded EEG during BCI control indicates that the LAP/S produces control signals that are more strongly correlated with the target location and a higher R-square value was shown at the fifth session. In the present study, we found that subjects' average online BCI performance using a large EEG montage does not show significantly better performance after the first session than a smaller montage comprised of a common subset of these electrodes. The LAP/S method with a small EEG montage allowed the subjects to improve their skills across sessions, but no improvement was shown for the CSP method."
29677690,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow users to operate a device or application by means of cognitive activity. This technology will ultimately be used in real-world environments which include the presence of distractors. The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of visual distractors on BCI performance. Sixteen able-bodied participants underwent neurofeedback training to achieve motor imagery-guided BCI control in an online paradigm using electroencephalography (EEG) to measure neural signals. Participants then completed two sessions of the motor imagery EEG-BCI protocol in the presence of infrequent, small visual distractors. BCI performance was determined based on classification accuracy. The presence of distractors was found to affect motor imagery-specific patterns in mu and beta power. However, the distractors did not significantly affect the BCI classification accuracy; across participants, the mean classification accuracy was 81.5 ± 14% for non-distractor trials, and 78.3 ± 17% for distractor trials. This minimal consequence suggests that the BCI was robust to distractor effects, despite motor imagery-related brain activity being attenuated amid distractors. A BCI system that mitigates distraction-related effects may improve the ease of its use and ultimately facilitate the effective translation of the technology from the lab to the home."
29674949,"Action observation (AO) generates event-related desynchronization (ERD) suppressions in the human brain by activating partial regions of the human mirror neuron system (hMNS). The activation of the hMNS response to AO remains controversial for several reasons. Therefore, this study investigated the activation of the hMNS response to a speed factor of AO by controlling the movement speed modes of a humanoid robot's arm movements. Since hMNS activation is reflected by ERD suppressions, electroencephalography (EEG) with BCI analysis methods for ERD suppressions were used as the recording and analysis modalities. Six healthy individuals were asked to participate in experiments comprising five different conditions. Four incremental-speed AO tasks and a motor imagery (MI) task involving imaging of the same movement were presented to the individuals. Occipital and sensorimotor regions were selected for BCI analyses. The experimental results showed that hMNS activation was higher in the occipital region but more robust in the sensorimotor region. Since the attended information impacts the activations of the hMNS during AO, the pattern of hMNS activations first rises and subsequently falls to a stable level during incremental-speed modes of AO. The discipline curves suggested that a moderate speed within a decent inter-stimulus interval (ISI) range produced the highest hMNS activations. Since a brain computer/machine interface (BCI) builds a path-way between human and computer/mahcine, the discipline curves will help to construct BCIs made by patterns of action observation (AO-BCI). Furthermore, a new method for constructing non-invasive brain machine brain interfaces (BMBIs) with moderate AO-BCI and motor imagery BCI (MI-BCI) was inspired by this paper."
29660675,"The motor-imagery based brain-computer interface supplies a potential approach for motor-impaired patients, not only to control rehabilitation facilities but also to promote recovery from motor dysfunctions. To improve event-related desynchronization during motor imagery and obtain improved brain-computer interface classification accuracy, we introduce dynamic video guidance and complex motor tasks to the motor imagery paradigm. Eleven participants were included in the experiment; 64-channel electroencephalographic data were collected and analyzed during four motor imagery tasks with different guidance. Time-frequency analysis, spectral-time variation analysis, topographical distribution maps, and statistical analysis were utilized to analyze the event-related desynchronization patterns. Common spatial patterns were used to extract spatial pattern features and support vector machines were used to discriminate the offline classification accuracies in three bands (the alpha band, beta band, alpha and beta band) for comparison. The experimental outcomes showed that complex motor imagery tasks coupled with dynamic video guidance induced significantly stronger event-related desynchronization than other paradigms, which use simple motor imagery tasks or static guidance. Similar results were obtained during analysis of the motor imagery brain-computer interface classification performance; namely, the highest average classification accuracy in complex and dynamic guidance was improved by approximately 14%, compared with static guidance. For individually specified paradigms, all participants obtained a classification accuracy that exceeded or was equal to 87.5%. This study provides an optional route to enhance the event-related desynchronization activities and classification accuracy of a motor imagery brain-computer interface through optimization of motor imagery tasks and instructive guidance."
29642493,"The purpose of this work is to strengthen the cortical excitability over the primary motor cortex (M1) and the cerebro-cerebellar pathway by means of a new transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) configuration to detect lower limb motor imagery (MI) in real time using two different cognitive neural states: relax and pedaling MI. The anode is located over the primary motor cortex in Cz, and the cathode over the right cerebro-cerebellum. The real-time brain-computer interface (BCI) designed is based on finding, for each electrode selected, the power at the particular frequency where the most difference between the two mental tasks is observed. Electroencephalographic (EEG) electrodes are placed over the brain's premotor area (PM), M1, supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary somatosensory cortex (S1). A single-blind study is carried out, where fourteen healthy subjects are separated into two groups: sham and active tDCS. Each subject is experimented on for five consecutive days. On all days, the results achieved by the active tDCS group were over 60% in real-time detection accuracy, with a five-day average of 62.6%. The sham group eventually reached those levels of accuracy, but it needed three days of training to do so."
29641392,"We conducted a study of a motor imagery brain-computer interface (BCI) using electroencephalography to continuously control a formant frequency speech synthesizer with instantaneous auditory and visual feedback. Over a three-session training period, sixteen participants learned to control the BCI for production of three vowel sounds (/ textipa i/ [heed], / textipa A/ [hot], and / textipa u/ [who'd]) and were split into three groups: those receiving unimodal auditory feedback of synthesized speech, those receiving unimodal visual feedback of formant frequencies, and those receiving multimodal, audio-visual (AV) feedback. Audio feedback was provided by a formant frequency artificial speech synthesizer, and visual feedback was given as a 2-D cursor on a graphical representation of the plane defined by the first two formant frequencies. We found that combined AV feedback led to the greatest performance in terms of percent accuracy, distance to target, and movement time to target compared with either unimodal feedback of auditory or visual information. These results indicate that performance is enhanced when multimodal feedback is meaningful for the BCI task goals, rather than as a generic biofeedback signal of BCI progress."
29616456,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) system allows direct communication between the brain and the external world. Common spatial pattern (CSP) has been used effectively for feature extraction of data used in BCI systems. However, many studies show that the performance of a BCI system using CSP largely depends on the filter parameters. The filter parameters that yield most discriminating information vary from subject to subject and manually tuning of the filter parameters is a difficult and time-consuming exercise. In this paper, we propose a new automated filter tuning approach for motor imagery electroencephalography (EEG) signal classification, which automatically and flexibly finds the filter parameters for optimal performance. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed method on two public benchmark datasets. Compared to the existing conventional CSP approach, our method reduces the average classification error rate by 2.89% and 3.61% for BCI Competition III dataset IVa and BCI Competition IV dataset I, respectively. Moreover, our proposed approach also achieved lowest average classification error rate compared to state-of-the-art methods studied in this paper. Thus, our proposed method can be potentially used for developing improved BCI systems, which can assist people with disabilities to recover their environmental control. It can also be used for enhanced disease recognition such as epileptic seizure detection using EEG signals. Graphical abstract ᅟ."
29615848,"<b>Objective:</b> To date, motion trajectory prediction (MTP) of a limb from non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) has relied, primarily, on band-pass filtered samples of EEG potentials i.e., the potential time-series model. Most MTP studies involve decoding 2D and 3D arm movements i.e., executed arm movements. Decoding of observed or imagined 3D movements has been demonstrated with limited success and only reported in a few studies. MTP studies normally use EEG potentials filtered in the low delta (~1 Hz) band for reconstructing the trajectory of an executed or an imagined/observed movement. In contrast to MTP, multiclass classification based sensorimotor rhythm brain-computer interfaces aim to classify movements using the power spectral density of mu (8-12 Hz) and beta (12-28 Hz) bands. <b>Approach:</b> We investigated if replacing the standard potentials time-series input with a power spectral density based bandpower time-series improves trajectory decoding accuracy of kinesthetically imagined 3D hand movement tasks (i.e., imagined 3D trajectory of the hand joint) and whether imagined 3D hand movements kinematics are encoded also in mu and beta bands. Twelve naïve subjects were asked to generate or imagine generating pointing movements with their right dominant arm to four targets distributed in 3D space in synchrony with an auditory cue (beep). <b>Main results:</b> Using the bandpower time-series based model, the highest decoding accuracy for motor execution was observed in mu and beta bands whilst for imagined movements the low gamma (28-40 Hz) band was also observed to improve decoding accuracy for some subjects. Moreover, for both (executed and imagined) movements, the bandpower time-series model with mu, beta, and low gamma bands produced significantly higher reconstruction accuracy than the commonly used potential time-series model and delta oscillations. <b>Significance:</b> Contrary to many studies that investigated only executed hand movements and recommend using delta oscillations for decoding directional information of a single limb joint, our findings suggest that motor kinematics for imagined movements are reflected mostly in power spectral density of mu, beta and low gamma bands, and that these bands may be most informative for decoding 3D trajectories of imagined limb movements."
29601538,"A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) provides a novel non-muscular communication method via brain signals. A BCI-speller can be considered as one of the first published BCI applications and has opened the gate for many advances in the field. Although many BCI-spellers have been developed during the last few decades, to our knowledge, no reviews have described the different spellers proposed and studied in this vital field. The presented speller systems are categorized according to major BCI paradigms: P300, steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), and motor imagery (MI). Different BCI paradigms require specific electroencephalogram (EEG) signal features and lead to the development of appropriate Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). The purpose of this review is to consolidate the most successful BCI-spellers published since 2010, while mentioning some other older systems which were built explicitly for spelling purposes. We aim to assist researchers and concerned individuals in the field by illustrating the highlights of different spellers and presenting them in one review. It is almost impossible to carry out an objective comparison between different spellers, as each has its variables, parameters, and conditions. However, the gathered information and the provided taxonomy about different BCI-spellers can be helpful, as it could identify suitable systems for first-hand users, as well as opportunities of development and learning from previous studies for BCI researchers."
29558654,"The start of the cue is often used to initiate the feature window used to control motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. However, the time latency during an MI period varies between trials for each participant. Fixing the starting time point of MI features can lead to decreased system performance in MI-based BCI systems. To address this issue, we propose a novel correlation-based time window selection (CTWS) algorithm for MI-based BCIs. Specifically, the optimized reference signals for each class were selected based on correlation analysis and performance evaluation. Furthermore, the starting points of time windows for both training and testing samples were adjusted using correlation analysis. Finally, the feature extraction and classification algorithms were used to calculate the classification accuracy. With two datasets, the results demonstrate that the CTWS algorithm significantly improved the system performance when compared to directly using feature extraction approaches. Importantly, the average improvement in accuracy of the CTWS algorithm on the datasets of healthy participants and stroke patients was 16.72% and 5.24%, respectively when compared to traditional common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm. In addition, the average accuracy increased 7.36% and 9.29%, respectively when the CTWS was used in conjunction with Sub-Alpha-Beta Log-Det Divergences (Sub-ABLD) algorithm. These findings suggest that the proposed CTWS algorithm holds promise as a general feature extraction approach for MI-based BCIs."
29546648,"This paper presents a novel algorithm (CVSTSCSP) for determining discriminative features from an optimal combination of temporal, spectral and spatial information for motor imagery brain computer interfaces. The proposed method involves four phases. In the first phase, EEG signal is segmented into overlapping time segments and bandpass filtered through frequency filter bank of variable size subbands. In the next phase, features are extracted from the segmented and filtered data using stationary common spatial pattern technique (SCSP) that can handle the non- stationarity and artifacts of EEG signal. The univariate feature selection method is used to obtain a relevant subset of features in the third phase. In the final phase, the classifier is used to build adecision model. In this paper, four univariate feature selection methods such as Euclidean distance, correlation, mutual information and Fisher discriminant ratio and two well-known classifiers (LDA and SVM) are investigated. The proposed method has been validated using the publicly available BCI competition IV dataset Ia and BCI Competition III dataset IVa. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing methods in terms of classification error. A reduction of 76.98%, 75.65%, 73.90% and 72.21% in classification error over both datasets and both classifiers can be observed using the proposed CVSTSCSP method in comparison to CSP, SBCSP, FBCSP and CVSCSP respectively."
29527160,"The performance of a brain-computer interface (BCI) can be enhanced by simultaneously using two or more modalities to record brain activity, which is generally referred to as a hybrid BCI. To date, many BCI researchers have tried to implement a hybrid BCI system by combining electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to improve the overall accuracy of binary classification. However, since hybrid EEG-NIRS BCI, which will be denoted by hBCI in this paper, has not been applied to ternary classification problems, paradigms and classification strategies appropriate for ternary classification using hBCI are not well investigated. Here we propose the use of an hBCI for the classification of three brain activation patterns elicited by mental arithmetic, motor imagery, and idle state, with the aim to elevate the information transfer rate (ITR) of hBCI by increasing the number of classes while minimizing the loss of accuracy. EEG electrodes were placed over the prefrontal cortex and the central cortex, and NIRS optodes were placed only on the forehead. The ternary classification problem was decomposed into three binary classification problems using the ""one-versus-one"" (OVO) classification strategy to apply the filter-bank common spatial patterns filter to EEG data. A 10 × 10-fold cross validation was performed using shrinkage linear discriminant analysis (sLDA) to evaluate the average classification accuracies for EEG-BCI, NIRS-BCI, and hBCI when the meta-classification method was adopted to enhance classification accuracy. The ternary classification accuracies for EEG-BCI, NIRS-BCI, and hBCI were 76.1 ± 12.8, 64.1 ± 9.7, and 82.2 ± 10.2%, respectively. The classification accuracy of the proposed hBCI was thus significantly higher than those of the other BCIs (<i>p</i> < 0.005). The average ITR for the proposed hBCI was calculated to be 4.70 ± 1.92 bits/minute, which was 34.3% higher than that reported for a previous binary hBCI study."
29522413,"In off-line training of motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), to enhance the generalization performance of the learned classifier, the local information contained in test data could be used to improve the performance of motor imagery as well. Further considering that the covariance matrices of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal lie on Riemannian manifold, in this paper, we construct a Riemannian graph to incorporate the information of training and test data into processing. The adjacency and weight in Riemannian graph are determined by the geodesic distance of Riemannian manifold. Then, a new graph embedding algorithm, called bilinear regularized locality preserving (BRLP), is derived upon the Riemannian graph for addressing the problems of high dimensionality frequently arising in BCIs. With a proposed regularization term encoding prior information of EEG channels, the BRLP could obtain more robust performance. Finally, an efficient classification algorithm based on extreme learning machine is proposed to perform on the tangent space of learned embedding. Experimental evaluations on the BCI competition and in-house data sets reveal that the proposed algorithms could obtain significantly higher performance than many competition algorithms after using same filter process."
29522410,"EEG-based brain computer interface (BCI) systems have demonstrated potential to assist patients with devastating motor paralysis conditions. However, there is great interest in shifting the BCI trend toward applications aimed at healthy users. Although BCI operation depends on technological factors (i.e., EEG pattern classification algorithm) and human factors (i.e., how well the person can generate good quality EEG patterns), it is the latter that is least investigated. In order to control a motor imagery-based BCI, users need to learn to modulate their sensorimotor brain rhythms by practicing motor imagery using a classical training protocol with an abstract visual feedback. In this paper, we investigate a different BCI training protocol using a human-like android robot (Geminoid HI-2) to provide realistic visual feedback. The proposed training protocol addresses deficiencies of the classical approach and takes the advantage of body-abled user capabilities. Experimental results suggest that android feedback-based BCI training improves the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms during motor imagery task. Moreover, we discuss how the influence of body ownership transfer illusion toward the android might have an effect on the modulation of event-related desynchronization/synchronization activity."
29522399,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are of complex structure and can be naturally represented as matrices. Classification is one of the most important steps for EEG signal processing. Newly developed classifiers can handle these matrix-form data by adding low-rank constraint to leverage the correlation within each data. However, classification of EEG signals is still challenging, because EEG signals are always contaminated by measurement artifacts, outliers, and non-standard noise sources. As a result, existing matrix classifiers may suffer from performance degradation, because they typically assume that the input EEG signals are clean. In this paper, to account for intra-sample outliers, we propose a novel classifier called a robust support matrix machine (RSMM), for single trial EEG data in matrix form. Inspired by the fact that empirical EEG signals contain strong correlation information, we assume that each EEG matrix can be decomposed into a latent low-rank clean matrix plus a sparse noise matrix. We simultaneously perform signal recovery and train the classifier based on the clean EEG matrices. We formulate our RSMM in a unified framework and present an effective solver based on the alternating direction method of multipliers. To evaluate the proposed method, we conduct extensive classification experiments on real binary EEG signals. The experimental results show that our method has outperformed the state-of-the-art matrix classifiers. This paper may lead to the development of robust brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) with intuitive motor imagery and thus promote the broad use of the noninvasive BCIs technology."
29515363,"Motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interface (BCI) has been developed as an alternative therapy for stroke rehabilitation. However, experimental evidence demonstrates that a significant portion (10-50%) of subjects are BCI-inefficient users (accuracy less than 70%). Thus, predicting BCI performance prior to clinical BCI usage would facilitate the selection of suitable end-users and improve the efficiency of stroke rehabilitation. In the current study, we proposed two physiological variables, i.e., laterality index (LI) and cortical activation strength (CAS), to predict MI-BCI performance. Twenty-four stroke patients and 10 healthy subjects were recruited for this study. Each subject was required to perform two blocks of left- and right-hand MI tasks. Linear regression analyses were performed between the BCI accuracies and two physiological predictors. Here, the predictors were calculated from the electroencephalography (EEG) signals during paretic hand MI tasks (5 trials; approximately 1 min). LI values exhibited a statistically significant correlation with two-class BCI (left vs. right) performance (r = -0.732, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and CAS values exhibited a statistically significant correlation with brain-switch BCI (task vs. idle) performance (<i>r</i> = 0.641, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Furthermore, the BCI-inefficient users were successfully recognized with a sensitivity of 88.2% and a specificity of 85.7% in the two-class BCI. The brain-switch BCI achieved a sensitivity of 100.0% and a specificity of 87.5% in the discrimination of BCI-inefficient users. These results demonstrated that the proposed BCI predictors were promising to promote the BCI usage in stroke rehabilitation and contribute to a better understanding of the BCI-inefficiency phenomenon in stroke patients."
29497931,"EEG signals have weak intensity, low signal-to-noise ratio, non-stationary, non-linear, time-frequency-spatial characteristics. Therefore, it is important to extract adaptive and robust features that reflect time, frequency and spatial characteristics. This paper proposes an effective feature extraction method WDPSD (feature extraction from the Weighted Difference of Power Spectral Density in an optimal channel couple) that can reflect time, frequency and spatial characteristics for 2-class motor imagery-based BCI system. In the WDPSD method, firstly, Power Spectral Density (PSD) matrices of EEG signals are calculated in all channels, and an optimal channel couple is selected from all possible channel couples by checking non-stationary and class separability, and then a weight matrix which reflects non-stationary of PSD difference matrix in selected channel couple is calculated; finally, the robust and adaptive features are extracted from the PSD difference matrix weighted by the weight matrix. The proposed method is evaluated from EEG signals of BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a and Dataset 2b. The experimental results show a good classification accuracy in single session, session-to-session, and the different types of 2-class motor imagery for different subjects."
29497370,"Performance variation is a critical issue in motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI), and various neurophysiological, psychological, and anatomical correlates have been reported in the literature. Although the main aim of such studies is to predict MI-BCI performance for the prescreening of poor performers, studies which focus on the user's sense of the motor imagery process and directly estimate MI-BCI performance through the user's self-prediction are lacking. In this study, we first test each user's self-prediction idea regarding motor imagery experimental datasets. Fifty-two subjects participated in a classical, two-class motor imagery experiment and were asked to evaluate their easiness with motor imagery and to predict their own MI-BCI performance. During the motor imagery experiment, an electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded; however, no feedback on motor imagery was given to subjects. From EEG recordings, the offline classification accuracy was estimated and compared with several questionnaire scores of subjects, as well as with each subject's self-prediction of MI-BCI performance. The subjects' performance predictions during motor imagery task showed a high positive correlation (<i>r</i> = 0.64, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Interestingly, it was observed that the self-prediction became more accurate as the subjects conducted more motor imagery tasks in the Correlation coefficient (pre-task to 2nd run: <i>r</i> = 0.02 to <i>r</i> = 0.54, <i>p</i> < 0.01) and root mean square error (pre-task to 3rd run: 17.7% to 10%, <i>p</i> < 0.01). We demonstrated that subjects may accurately predict their MI-BCI performance even without feedback information. This implies that the human brain is an active learning system and, by self-experiencing the endogenous motor imagery process, it can sense and adopt the quality of the process. Thus, it is believed that users may be able to predict MI-BCI performance and results may contribute to a better understanding of low performance and advancing BCI."
29449799,"Quick detection of motor intentions is critical in order to minimize the time required to activate a neuroprosthesis. We propose a Markov Switching Model (MSM) to achieve quick detection of an event related desynchronization (ERD) elicited by motor imagery (MI) and recorded by electroencephalography (EEG). Conventional brain computer interfaces (BCI) rely on sliding window classifiers in order to perform online continuous classification of the rest vs. MI classes. Based on this approach, the detection of abrupt changes in the sensorimotor power suffers from an intrinsic delay caused by the necessity of computing an estimate of variance across several tenths of a second. Here we propose to avoid explicitly computing the EEG signal variance, and estimate the ERD state directly from the voltage information, in order to reduce the detection latency. This is achieved by using a model suitable in situations characterized by abrupt changes of state, the MSM. In our implementation, the model takes the form of a Gaussian observation model whose variance is governed by two latent discrete states with Markovian dynamics. Its objective is to estimate the brain state (i.e., rest vs. ERD) given the EEG voltage, spatially filtered by common spatial pattern (CSP), as observation. The two variances associated with the two latent states are calibrated using the variance of the CSP projection during rest and MI, respectively. The transition matrix of the latent states is optimized by the ""quickest detection"" strategy that minimizes a cost function of detection latency and false positive rate. Data collected by a dry EEG system from 50 healthy subjects, was used to assess performance and compare the MSM with several logistic regression classifiers of different sliding window lengths. As a result, the MSM achieves a significantly better tradeoff between latency, false positive and true positive rates. The proposed model could be used to achieve a more reactive and stable control of a neuroprosthesis. This is a desirable property in BCI-based neurorehabilitation, where proprioceptive feedback is provided based on the patient's brain signal. Indeed, it is hypothesized that simultaneous contingent association between brain signals and proprioceptive feedback induces superior associative learning."
29446352,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) refers to procedures that link the central nervous system to a device. BCI was historically performed using electroencephalography (EEG). In the last years, encouraging results were obtained by combining EEG with other neuroimaging technologies, such as functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). A crucial step of BCI is brain state classification from recorded signal features. Deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) recently reached unprecedented complex classification outcomes. These performances were achieved through increased computational power, efficient learning algorithms, valuable activation functions, and restricted or back-fed neurons connections. By expecting significant overall BCI performances, we investigated the capabilities of combining EEG and fNIRS recordings with state-of-the-art deep learning procedures. We performed a guided left and right hand motor imagery task on 15 subjects with a fixed classification response time of 1 s and overall experiment length of 10 min. Left versus right classification accuracy of a DNN in the multi-modal recording modality was estimated and it was compared to standalone EEG and fNIRS and other classifiers. At a group level we obtained significant increase in performance when considering multi-modal recordings and DNN classifier with synergistic effect. BCI performances can be significantly improved by employing multi-modal recordings that provide electrical and hemodynamic brain activity information, in combination with advanced non-linear deep learning classification procedures."
29432108,"Inter-subject and inter-session variabilities pose a significant challenge in electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Furthermore, high dimensional EEG montages introduce huge computational burden due to excessive number of channels involved. Two experimental, i.e., inter-session and inter-subject, variabilities of EEG dynamics during motor imagery (MI) tasks are investigated in this paper. In particular, the effect on the performance of the BCIs due to day-to-day variability in EEG dynamics during the alterations in cognitive stages is explored. In addition, the inter-subject BCIs feasibility between cortically synchronized and desynchronized subject pairs on pairwise performance associativity is further examined. Moreover, the consequences of integrating spatial brain dynamics of varying the number of channels - from specific regions of the brain - are also discussed in case of both the contexts. The proposed approach is validated on real BCI data set containing EEG data from four classes of MI tasks, i.e., left/right hand, both feet, and tongue, subjected prior to a preprocessing of three different spatial filtering techniques. Experimental results have shown that a maximum classification accuracy of around 58% was achieved for the inter-subject experimental case, whereas a 31% deviation was noticed in the classification accuracies across two sessions during the inter-session experimental case. In conclusion, BCIs, without the subject-and session-specific calibration and with lesser number of channels employed, play a vital role while promoting a generic and efficient framework for plug and play use."
29423352,"Motor imagery-based (MI based) brain-computer interface (BCI) using electroencephalography (EEG) allows users to directly control a computer or external device by modulating and decoding the brain waves. A variety of factors could potentially affect the performance of BCI such as the health status of subjects or the environment. In this study, we investigated the effects of soft drinks and regular coffee on EEG signals under resting state and on the performance of MI based BCI. Twenty-six healthy human subjects participated in three or four BCI sessions with a resting period in each session. During each session, the subjects drank an unlabeled soft drink with either sugar (Caffeine Free Coca-Cola), caffeine (Diet Coke), neither ingredient (Caffeine Free Diet Coke), or a regular coffee if there was a fourth session. The resting state spectral power in each condition was compared; the analysis showed that power in alpha and beta band after caffeine consumption were decreased substantially compared to control and sugar condition. Although the attenuation of powers in the frequency range used for the online BCI control signal was shown, group averaged BCI online performance after consuming caffeine was similar to those of other conditions. This work, for the first time, shows the effect of caffeine, sugar intake on the online BCI performance and resting state brain signal."
29363625,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can enable individuals with tetraplegia to communicate and control external devices. Though much progress has been made in improving the speed and robustness of neural control provided by intracortical BCIs, little research has been devoted to minimizing the amount of time spent on decoder calibration. We investigated the amount of time users needed to calibrate decoders and achieve performance saturation using two markedly different decoding algorithms: the steady-state Kalman filter, and a novel technique using Gaussian process regression (GP-DKF). Three people with tetraplegia gained rapid closed-loop neural cursor control and peak, plateaued decoder performance within 3 min of initializing calibration. We also show that a BCI-naïve user (T5) was able to rapidly attain closed-loop neural cursor control with the GP-DKF using self-selected movement imagery on his first-ever day of closed-loop BCI use, acquiring a target 37 s after initiating calibration. These results demonstrate the potential for an intracortical BCI to be used immediately after deployment by people with paralysis, without the need for user learning or extensive system calibration."
29358903,"The classification of ankle movements from non-invasive brain recordings can be applied to a brain-computer interface (BCI) to control exoskeletons, prosthesis, and functional electrical stimulators for the benefit of patients with walking impairments. In this research, ankle flexion and extension tasks at two force levels in both legs, were classified from cortical current sources estimated by a hierarchical variational Bayesian method, using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings. The hierarchical prior for the current source estimation from EEG was obtained from activated brain areas and their intensities from an fMRI group (second-level) analysis. The fMRI group analysis was performed on regions of interest defined over the primary motor cortex, the supplementary motor area, and the somatosensory area, which are well-known to contribute to movement control. A sparse logistic regression method was applied for a nine-class classification (eight active tasks and a resting control task) obtaining a mean accuracy of 65.64% for time series of current sources, estimated from the EEG and the fMRI signals using a variational Bayesian method, and a mean accuracy of 22.19% for the classification of the pre-processed of EEG sensor signals, with a chance level of 11.11%. The higher classification accuracy of current sources, when compared to EEG classification accuracy, was attributed to the high number of sources and the different signal patterns obtained in the same vertex for different motor tasks. Since the inverse filter estimation for current sources can be done offline with the present method, the present method is applicable to real-time BCIs. Finally, due to the highly enhanced spatial distribution of current sources over the brain cortex, this method has the potential to identify activation patterns to design BCIs for the control of an affected limb in patients with stroke, or BCIs from motor imagery in patients with spinal cord injury."
29348781,"Obtaining a fast and reliable decision is an important issue in brain-computer interfaces (BCI), particularly in practical real-time applications such as wheelchair or neuroprosthetic control. In this study, the EEG signals were firstly analyzed with a power projective base method. Then we were applied a decision-making model, the sequential probability ratio testing (SPRT), for single-trial classification of motor imagery movement events. The unique strength of this proposed classification method lies in its accumulative process, which increases the discriminative power as more and more evidence is observed over time. The properties of the method were illustrated on thirteen subjects' recordings from three datasets. Results showed that our proposed power projective method outperformed two benchmark methods for every subject. Moreover, with sequential classifier, the accuracies across subjects were significantly higher than that with nonsequential ones. The average maximum accuracy of the SPRT method was 84.1%, as compared with 82.3% accuracy for the sequential Bayesian (SB) method. The proposed SPRT method provides an explicit relationship between stopping time, thresholds, and error, which is important for balancing the time-accuracy trade-off. These results suggest SPRT would be useful in speeding up decision-making while trading off errors in BCI."
29348744,"We present an improvement to the quaternion-based signal analysis (QSA) technique to extract electroencephalography (EEG) signal features with a view to developing real-time applications, particularly in motor imagery (IM) cognitive processes. The proposed methodology (iQSA, <i>improved</i> QSA) extracts features such as the average, variance, homogeneity, and contrast of EEG signals related to motor imagery in a more efficient manner (i.e., by reducing the number of samples needed to classify the signal and improving the classification percentage) compared to the original QSA technique. Specifically, we can sample the signal in variable time periods (from 0.5 s to 3 s, in half-a-second intervals) to determine the relationship between the number of samples and their effectiveness in classifying signals. In addition, to strengthen the classification process a number of boosting-technique-based decision trees were implemented. The results show an 82.30% accuracy rate for 0.5 s samples and 73.16% for 3 s samples. This is a significant improvement compared to the original QSA technique that offered results from 33.31% to 40.82% without sampling window and from 33.44% to 41.07% with sampling window, respectively. We can thus conclude that iQSA is better suited to develop real-time applications."
29335359,"Standard brain stimulation protocols modify human motor cortex excitability by modulating the gain of the activated corticospinal pathways. However, the restoration of motor function following lesions of the corticospinal tract requires also the recruitment of additional neurons to increase the net corticospinal output. For this purpose, we investigated a novel protocol based on brain state-dependent paired associative stimulation.Motor imagery (MI)-related electroencephalography was recorded in healthy males and females for brain state-dependent control of both cortical and peripheral stimulation in a brain-machine interface environment. State-dependency was investigated with concurrent, delayed, and independent stimulation relative to the MI task. Specifically, sensorimotor event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the β-band (16-22 Hz) triggered peripheral stimulation through passive hand opening by a robotic orthosis and transcranial magnetic stimulation to the respective cortical motor representation, either synchronously or subsequently. These MI-related paradigms were compared with paired cortical and peripheral input applied independent of the brain state. Cortical stimulation resulted in a significant increase in corticospinal excitability only when applied brain state-dependently and synchronously to peripheral input. These gains were resistant to a depotentiation task, revealed a nonlinear evolution of plasticity, and were mediated via the recruitment of additional corticospinal neurons rather than via synchronization of neuronal firing. Recruitment of additional corticospinal pathways may be achieved when cortical and peripheral inputs are applied concurrently, and during β-ERD. These findings resemble a gating mechanism and are potentially important for developing closed-loop brain stimulation for the treatment of hand paralysis following lesions of the corticospinal tract.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The activity state of the motor system influences the excitability of corticospinal pathways to external input. State-dependent interventions harness this property to increase the connectivity between motor cortex and muscles. These stimulation protocols modulate the gain of the activated pathways, but not the overall corticospinal recruitment. In this study, a brain-machine interface paired peripheral stimulation through passive hand opening with transcranial magnetic stimulation to the respective cortical motor representation during volitional β-band desynchronization. Cortical stimulation resulted in the recruitment of additional corticospinal pathways, but only when applied brain state-dependently and synchronously to peripheral input. These effects resemble a gating mechanism and may be important for the restoration of motor function following lesions of the corticospinal tract."
29326653,"The purpose of this study was to establish the feasibility of manipulating a prosthetic knee directly by using a brain-computer interface (BCI) system in a transfemoral amputee. Although the other forms of control could be more reliable and quick (e.g., electromyography control), the electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI may provide amputees an alternative way to control a prosthesis directly from brain. A transfemoral amputee subject was trained to activate a knee-unlocking switch through motor imagery of the movement of his lower extremity. Surface scalp electrodes transmitted brain wave data to a software program that was keyed to activate the switch when the event-related desynchronization in EEG reached a certain threshold. After achieving more than 90% reliability for switch activation by EEG rhythm-feedback training, the subject then progressed to activating the knee-unlocking switch on a prosthesis that turned on a motor and unlocked a prosthetic knee. The project took place in the prosthetic department of a Veterans Administration medical center. The subject walked back and forth in the parallel bars and unlocked the knee for swing phase and for sitting down. The success of knee unlocking through this system was measured. Additionally, the subject filled out a questionnaire on his experiences. The success of unlocking the prosthetic knee mechanism ranged from 50 to 100% in eight test segments. The performance of the subject supports the feasibility for BCI control of a lower extremity prosthesis using surface scalp EEG electrodes. Investigating direct brain control in different types of patients is important to promote real-world BCI applications."
29324403,"A large proportion of users do not achieve adequate control using current non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). This issue has being coined ""BCI-Illiteracy"" and is observed among different BCI modalities. Here, we compare the performance and the BCI-illiteracy rate of a tactile selective sensation (SS) and motor imagery (MI) BCI, for a large subject samples. We analyzed 80 experimental sessions from 57 subjects with two-class SS protocols. For SS, the group average performance was 79.8 ± 10.6%, with 43 out of the 57 subjects (75.4%) exceeding the 70% BCI-illiteracy threshold for left- and right-hand SS discrimination. When compared with previous results, this tactile BCI outperformed all other tactile BCIs currently available. We also analyzed 63 experimental sessions from 43 subjects with two-class MI BCI protocols, where the group average performance was 77.2 ± 13.3%, with 69.7% of the subjects exceeding the 70% performance threshold for left- and right-hand MI. For within-subject comparison, the 24 subjects who participated to both the SS and MI experiments, the BCI performance was superior with SS than MI especially in beta frequency band (p < 0.05), with enhanced R<sup>2</sup> discriminative information in the somatosensory cortex for the SS modality. Both SS and MI showed a functional dissociation between lower alpha ([8 10] Hz) and upper alpha ([10 13] Hz) bands, with BCI performance significantly better in the upper alpha than the lower alpha (p < 0.05) band. In summary, we demonstrated that SS is a promising BCI modality with low BCI illiteracy issue and has great potential in practical applications reaching large population."
29311771,"In rehabilitation of patients with spinal cord injury (SCI), imagination of movement is a candidate tool to promote long-term recovery or to control futuristic neuroprostheses. However, little is known about the ability of patients with spinal cord injury to perform this task. It is likely that without the ability to effectively perform the movement, the imagination of movement is also problematic. We therefore examined, whether patients with SCI experience increased difficulties in motor imagery (MI) compared to healthy controls. We examined 7 male patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (aged 23-70 years, median 53) and 20 healthy controls (aged 21-54 years, median 30). All patients had incomplete SCI, with AIS (ASIA Impairment Scale) grades of C or D. All had cervical lesions, except one who had a thoracic injury level. Duration after injury ranged from 3 to 314 months. We performed the Movement Imagery Questionnaire Revised as well as the Beck Depression Inventory in all participants. The self-assessed ability of patients to visually imagine movements ranged from 7 to 36 (<i>Md</i> = 30) and tended to be decreased in comparison to healthy controls (ranged 16-49, <i>Md</i> = 42.5; <i>W</i> = 326.5, <i>p</i> = 0.055). Also, the self-assessed ability of patients to kinesthetically imagine movements (range = 7-35, <i>Md</i> = 31) differed significantly from the control group (range = 23-49, <i>Md</i> = 41; <i>W</i> = 337.5, <i>p</i> = 0.0047). Two patients yielded tendencies for depressive mood and they also reported most problems with movement imagination. Statistical analysis however did not confirm a general relationship between depressive mood and increased difficulty in MI across both groups. Patients with spinal cord injury seem to experience difficulties in imagining movements compared to healthy controls. This result might not only have implications for training and rehabilitation programs, but also for applications like brain-computer interfaces used to control neuroprostheses, which are often based on the brain signals exhibited during the imagination of movements."
29297303,"Common spatial pattern (CSP) has been an effective technique for feature extraction in electroencephalography (EEG) based brain computer interfaces (BCIs). However, motor imagery EEG signal feature extraction using CSP generally depends on the selection of the frequency bands to a great extent. In this study, we propose a mutual information based frequency band selection approach. The idea of the proposed method is to utilize the information from all the available channels for effectively selecting the most discriminative filter banks. CSP features are extracted from multiple overlapping sub-bands. An additional sub-band has been introduced that cover the wide frequency band (7-30 Hz) and two different types of features are extracted using CSP and common spatio-spectral pattern techniques, respectively. Mutual information is then computed from the extracted features of each of these bands and the top filter banks are selected for further processing. Linear discriminant analysis is applied to the features extracted from each of the filter banks. The scores are fused together, and classification is done using support vector machine. The proposed method is evaluated using BCI Competition III dataset IVa, BCI Competition IV dataset I and BCI Competition IV dataset IIb, and it outperformed all other competing methods achieving the lowest misclassification rate and the highest kappa coefficient on all three datasets. Introducing a wide sub-band and using mutual information for selecting the most discriminative sub-bands, the proposed method shows improvement in motor imagery EEG signal classification."
29296627,"There is a growing interest in the possibility of using functional neuroimaging techniques to aid in detecting covert awareness in patients who are thought to be suffering from a disorder of consciousness. Immerging optical techniques such as time-resolved functional near-infrared spectroscopy (TR-fNIRS) are ideal for such applications due to their low-cost, portability, and enhanced sensitivity to brain activity. The aim of this case study was to investigate for the first time the ability of TR-fNIRS to detect command driven motor imagery (MI) activity in a functionally locked-in patient suffering from Guillain-Barré syndrome. In addition, the utility of using TR-fNIRS as a brain-computer interface (BCI) was also assessed by instructing the patient to perform an MI task as affirmation to three questions: (1) confirming his last name, (2) if he was in pain, and (3) if he felt safe. At the time of this study, the patient had regained limited eye movement, which provided an opportunity to accurately validate a BCI after the fNIRS study was completed. Comparing the two sets of responses showed that fNIRS provided the correct answers to all of the questions. These promising results demonstrate for the first time the potential of using an MI paradigm in combination with fNIRS to communicate with functionally locked-in patients without the need for prior training."
33265109,"Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) have been attracting a great interest in recent years. The common spatial patterns (CSP) technique is a well-established approach to the spatial filtering of the electroencephalogram (EEG) data in BCI applications. Even though CSP was originally proposed from a heuristic viewpoint, it can be also built on very strong foundations using information theory. This paper reviews the relationship between CSP and several information-theoretic approaches, including the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the Beta divergence and the Alpha-Beta log-det (AB-LD)divergence. We also revise other approaches based on the idea of selecting those features that are maximally informative about the class labels. The performance of all the methods will be also compared via experiments."
29282131,"In this work, we share our experiences made at the world-wide first CYBATHLON, an event organized by the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETH Zürich), which took place in Zurich in October 2016. It is a championship for severely motor impaired people using assistive prototype devices to compete against each other. Our team, the Graz BCI Racing Team MIRAGE91 from Graz University of Technology, participated in the discipline ""Brain-Computer Interface Race"". A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a device facilitating control of applications via the user's thoughts. Prominent applications include assistive technology such as wheelchairs, neuroprostheses or communication devices. In the CYBATHLON BCI Race, pilots compete in a BCI-controlled computer game. We report on setting up our team, the BCI customization to our pilot including long term training and the final BCI system. Furthermore, we describe CYBATHLON participation and analyze our CYBATHLON result. We found that our pilot was compliant over the whole time and that we could significantly reduce the average runtime between start and finish from initially 178 s to 143 s. After the release of the final championship specifications with shorter track length, the average runtime converged to 120 s. We successfully participated in the qualification race at CYBATHLON 2016, but performed notably worse than during training, with a runtime of 196 s. We speculate that shifts in the features, due to the nonstationarities in the electroencephalogram (EEG), but also arousal are possible reasons for the unexpected result. Potential counteracting measures are discussed. The CYBATHLON 2016 was a great opportunity for our student team. We consolidated our theoretical knowledge and turned it into practice, allowing our pilot to play a computer game. However, further research is required to make BCI technology invariant to non-task related changes of the EEG."
29270110,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to affect motor and cognitive task performance and learning when applied to brain areas involved in the task. Targeted stimulation has also been found to alter connectivity within the stimulated hemisphere during rest. However, the connectivity effect of the interaction of endogenous task specific activity and targeted stimulation is unclear. This study examined the aftereffects of concurrent anodal high-definition tDCS over the left sensorimotor cortex with motor network connectivity during a one-dimensional EEG based sensorimotor rhythm brain-computer interface (SMR-BCI) task. Directed connectivity following anodal tDCS illustrates altered connections bilaterally between frontal and parietal regions, and these alterations occur in a task specific manner; connections between similar cortical regions are altered differentially during left and right imagination trials. During right-hand imagination following anodal tDCS, there was an increase in outflow from the left premotor cortex (PMC) to multiple regions bilaterally in the motor network and increased inflow to the stimulated sensorimotor cortex from the ipsilateral PMC and contralateral sensorimotor cortex. During left-hand imagination following anodal tDCS, there was increased outflow from the stimulated sensorimotor cortex to regions across the motor network. Significant correlations between connectivity and the behavioral measures of total correct trials and time-to-hit (TTH) correct trials were also found, specifically that the input to the left PMC correlated with decreased right hand imagination performance and that flow from the ipsilateral posterior parietal cortex (PPC) to midline sensorimotor cortex correlated with improved performance for both right and left hand imagination. These results indicate that tDCS interacts with task-specific endogenous activity to alter directed connectivity during SMR-BCI. In order to predict and maximize the targeted effect of tDCS, the interaction of stimulation with the dynamics of endogenous activity needs to be examined comprehensively and understood."
29249952,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) has attracted great interests for its effectiveness in assisting disabled people. However, due to the poor BCI performance, this technique is still far from daily-life applications. One of critical issues confronting BCI research is how to enhance BCI performance. This study aimed at improving the motor imagery (MI) based BCI accuracy by integrating MI tasks with unilateral tactile stimulation (Uni-TS). The effects were tested on both healthy subjects and stroke patients in a controlled study. Twenty-two healthy subjects and four stroke patients were recruited and randomly divided into a control-group and an enhanced-group. In the control-group, subjects performed two blocks of conventional MI tasks (left hand vs. right hand), with 80 trials in each block. In the enhanced-group, subjects also performed two blocks of MI tasks, but constant tactile stimulation was applied on the non-dominant/paretic hand during MI tasks in the second block. We found the Uni-TS significantly enhanced the contralateral cortical activations during MI of the stimulated hand, whereas it had no influence on activation patterns during MI of the non-stimulated hand. The two-class BCI decoding accuracy was significantly increased from 72.5% (MI without Uni-TS) to 84.7% (MI with Uni-TS) in the enhanced-group (<i>p</i> < 0.001, paired <i>t</i>-test). Moreover, stroke patients in the enhanced-group achieved an accuracy >80% during MI with Uni-TS. This novel approach complements the conventional methods for BCI enhancement without increasing source information or complexity of signal processing. This enhancement via Uni-TS may facilitate clinical applications of MI-BCI."
29220327,"This paper presents a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) that combines motor imagery (MI) and P300 potential for the asynchronous operation of a brain-controlled wheelchair whose design is based on a Mecanum wheel. This paradigm is completely user-centric. By sequentially performing MI tasks or paying attention to P300 flashing, the user can use eleven functions to control the wheelchair: move forward/backward, move left/right, move left45/right45, accelerate/decelerate, turn left/right, and stop. The practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach were validated in eight subjects, all of whom achieved good performance. The preliminary results indicated that the proposed hybrid BCI system with different mental strategies operating sequentially is feasible and has potential applications for practical self-paced control."
29181021,"Based on recent electroencephalography (EEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) studies that showed that tasks such as motor imagery and mental arithmetic induce specific neural response patterns, we propose a hybrid brain-computer interface (hBCI) paradigm in which EEG and NIRS data are fused to improve binary classification performance. We recorded simultaneous NIRS-EEG data from nine participants performing seven mental tasks (word generation, mental rotation, subtraction, singing and navigation, and motor and face imagery). Classifiers were trained for each possible pair of tasks using (1) EEG features alone, (2) NIRS features alone, and (3) EEG and NIRS features combined, to identify the best task pairs and assess the usefulness of a multimodal approach. The NIRS-EEG approach led to an average increase in peak kappa of 0.03 when using features extracted from one-second windows (equivalent to an increase of 1.5% in classification accuracy for balanced classes). The increase was much stronger (0.20, corresponding to an 10% accuracy increase) when focusing on time windows of high NIRS performance. The EEG and NIRS analyses further unveiled relevant brain regions and important feature types. This work provides a basis for future NIRS-EEG hBCI studies aiming to improve classification performance toward more efficient and flexible BCIs."
29163110,"Part of the process of EEG microstate estimation involves clustering EEG channel data at the global field power (GFP) maxima, very commonly using a modified K-means approach. Clustering has also been done deterministically, despite there being uncertainties in multiple stages of the microstate analysis, including the GFP peak definition, the clustering itself and in the post-clustering assignment of microstates back onto the EEG timecourse of interest. We perform a fully probabilistic microstate clustering and labeling, to account for these sources of uncertainty using the closest probabilistic analog to KM called Fuzzy C-means (FCM). We train softmax multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) using the KM and FCM-inferred cluster assignments as target labels, to then allow for probabilistic labeling of the full EEG data instead of the usual correlation-based deterministic microstate label assignment typically used. We assess the merits of the probabilistic analysis vs. the deterministic approaches in EEG data recorded while participants perform real or imagined motor movements from a publicly available data set of 109 subjects. Though FCM group template maps that are almost topographically identical to KM were found, there is considerable uncertainty in the subsequent assignment of microstate labels. In general, imagined motor movements are less predictable on a time point-by-time point basis, possibly reflecting the more exploratory nature of the brain state during imagined, compared to during real motor movements. We find that some relationships may be more evident using FCM than using KM and propose that future microstate analysis should preferably be performed probabilistically rather than deterministically, especially in situations such as with brain computer interfaces, where both training and applying models of microstates need to account for uncertainty. Probabilistic neural network-driven microstate assignment has a number of advantages that we have discussed, which are likely to be further developed and exploited in future studies. In conclusion, probabilistic clustering and a probabilistic neural network-driven approach to microstate analysis is likely to better model and reveal details and the variability hidden in current deterministic and binarized microstate assignment and analyses."
29148137,"Conventional therapies do not provide paralyzed patients with closed-loop sensorimotor integration for motor rehabilitation. This work presents the recoveriX system, a hardware and software platform that combines a motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI), functional electrical stimulation (FES), and visual feedback technologies for a complete sensorimotor closed-loop therapy system for poststroke rehabilitation. The proposed system was tested on two chronic stroke patients in a clinical environment. The patients were instructed to imagine the movement of either the left or right hand in random order. During these two MI tasks, two types of feedback were provided: a bar extending to the left or right side of a monitor as visual feedback and passive hand opening stimulated from FES as proprioceptive feedback. Both types of feedback relied on the BCI classification result achieved using common spatial patterns and a linear discriminant analysis classifier. After 10 sessions of recoveriX training, one patient partially regained control of wrist extension in her paretic wrist and the other patient increased the range of middle finger movement by 1 cm. A controlled group study is planned with a new version of the recoveriX system, which will have several improvements."
29134143,"Hands motor imagery (MI) has been reported to alter synchronization patterns amongst neurons, yielding variations in the mu and beta bands' power spectral density (PSD) of the electroencephalography (EEG) signal. These alterations have been used in the field of brain-computer interfaces (BCI), in an attempt to assign distinct MI tasks to commands of such a system. Recent studies have highlighted that information may be missing if knowledge about brain functional connectivity is not considered. In this work, we modeled the brain as a graph in which each EEG electrode represents a node. Our goal was to understand if there exists any linear correlation between variations in the synchronization patterns-that is, variations in the PSD of mu and beta bands-induced by MI and alterations in the corresponding functional networks. Moreover, we (1) explored the feasibility of using functional connectivity parameters as features for a classifier in the context of an MI-BCI; (2) investigated three different types of feature selection (FS) techniques; and (3) compared our approach to a more traditional method using the signal PSD as classifier inputs. Ten healthy subjects participated in this study. We observed significant correlations (<i>p</i> < 0.05) with values ranging from 0.4 to 0.9 between PSD variations and functional network alterations for some electrodes, prominently in the beta band. The PSD method performed better for data classification, with mean accuracies of (90 ± 8)% and (87 ± 7)% for the mu and beta band, respectively, versus (83 ± 8)% and (83 ± 7)% for the same bands for the graph method. Moreover, the number of features for the graph method was considerably larger. However, results for both methods were relatively close, and even overlapped when the uncertainties of the accuracy rates were considered. Further investigation regarding a careful exploration of other graph metrics may provide better alternatives."
29130453,"Two-dimensional movement control is a popular issue in brain-computer interface (BCI) research and has many applications in the real world. In this paper, we introduce a combined control strategy to a binary class-based BCI system that allows the user to move a cursor in a two-dimensional (2D) plane. Users focus on a single moving vector to control 2D movement instead of controlling vertical and horizontal movement separately. Five participants took part in a fixed-target experiment and random-target experiment to verify the effectiveness of the combination control strategy under the fixed and random routine conditions. Both experiments were performed in a virtual 2D dimensional environment and visual feedback was provided on the screen. The five participants achieved an average hit rate of 98.9% and 99.4% for the fixed-target experiment and the random-target experiment, respectively. The results demonstrate that participants could move the cursor in the 2D plane effectively. The proposed control strategy is based only on a basic two-motor imagery BCI, which enables more people to use it in real-life applications."
29117100,"Motor Imagery (MI) electroencephalography (EEG) is widely studied for its non-invasiveness, easy availability, portability, and high temporal resolution. As for MI EEG signal processing, the high dimensions of features represent a research challenge. It is necessary to eliminate redundant features, which not only create an additional overhead of managing the space complexity, but also might include outliers, thereby reducing classification accuracy. The firefly algorithm (FA) can adaptively select the best subset of features, and improve classification accuracy. However, the FA is easily entrapped in a local optimum. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a method of combining the firefly algorithm and learning automata (LA) to optimize feature selection for motor imagery EEG. We employed a method of combining common spatial pattern (CSP) and local characteristic-scale decomposition (LCD) algorithms to obtain a high dimensional feature set, and classified it by using the spectral regression discriminant analysis (SRDA) classifier. Both the fourth brain-computer interface competition data and real-time data acquired in our designed experiments were used to verify the validation of the proposed method. Compared with genetic and adaptive weight particle swarm optimization algorithms, the experimental results show that our proposed method effectively eliminates redundant features, and improves the classification accuracy of MI EEG signals. In addition, a real-time brain-computer interface system was implemented to verify the feasibility of our proposed methods being applied in practical brain-computer interface systems."
29100117,"Classification of electroencephalography (EEG) signals for motor imagery based brain computer interface (MI-BCI) is an exigent task and common spatial pattern (CSP) has been extensively explored for this purpose. In this work, we focused on developing a new framework for classification of EEG signals for MI-BCI. We propose a single band CSP framework for MI-BCI that utilizes the concept of tangent space mapping (TSM) in the manifold of covariance matrices. The proposed method is named CSP-TSM. Spatial filtering is performed on the bandpass filtered MI EEG signal. Riemannian tangent space is utilized for extracting features from the spatial filtered signal. The TSM features are then fused with the CSP variance based features and feature selection is performed using Lasso. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is then applied to the selected features and finally classification is done using support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The proposed framework gives improved performance for MI EEG signal classification in comparison with several competing methods. Experiments conducted shows that the proposed framework reduces the overall classification error rate for MI-BCI by 3.16%, 5.10% and 1.70% (for BCI Competition III dataset IVa, BCI Competition IV Dataset I and BCI Competition IV Dataset IIb, respectively) compared to the conventional CSP method under the same experimental settings. The proposed CSP-TSM method produces promising results when compared with several competing methods in this paper. In addition, the computational complexity is less compared to that of TSM method. Our proposed CSP-TSM framework can be potentially used for developing improved MI-BCI systems."
29096552,"EEG-based motor imagery is very useful in brain-computer interface. How to identify the imaging movement is still being researched. Electroencephalography (EEG) microstates reflect the spatial configuration of quasi-stable electrical potential topographies. Different microstates represent different brain functions. In this paper, microstate method was used to process the EEG-based motor imagery to obtain microstate. The single-trial EEG microstate sequences differences between two motor imagery tasks - imagination of left and right hand movement were investigated. The microstate parameters - duration, time coverage and occurrence per second as well as the transition probability of the microstate sequences were obtained with spatio-temporal microstate analysis. The results were shown significant differences (P < 0.05) with paired t-test between the two tasks. Then these microstate parameters were used as features and a linear support vector machine (SVM) was utilized to classify the two tasks with mean accuracy 89.17%, superior performance compared to the other methods. These indicate that the microstate can be a promising feature to improve the performance of the brain-computer interface classification."

This paper describes an electroencephalogram-based brain-controlled lower-limb exoskeleton for gait training, as a proof of concept towards rehabilitation with human-in-the-loop. Instead of using conventional single electroencephalography correlates, e.g., evoked P300 or spontaneous motor imagery, we propose a novel framework integrated two asynchronous signal modalities, i.e., sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) and movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs). We executed experiments in a biologically inspired and customized lower-limb exoskeleton where subjects (N = 6) actively controlled the robot using their brain signals. Each subject performed three consecutive sessions composed of offline training, online visual feedback testing, and online robot-control recordings. Post hoc evaluations were conducted including mental workload assessment, feature analysis, and statistics test. An average robot-control accuracy of 80.16% ± 5.44% was obtained with the SMR-based method, while estimation using the MRCP-based method yielded an average performance of 68.62% ± 8.55%. The experimental results showed the feasibility of the proposed framework with all subjects successfully controlled the exoskeleton. The current paradigm could be further extended to paraplegic patients in clinical trials."
29080913,"To control multiple degrees of freedom (MDoF) upper limb prostheses, pattern recognition (PR) of electromyogram (EMG) signals has been successfully applied. This technique requires amputees to provide sufficient EMG signals to decode their limb movement intentions (LMIs). However, amputees with neuromuscular disorder/high level amputation often cannot provide sufficient EMG control signals, and thus the applicability of the EMG-PR technique is limited especially to this category of amputees. As an alternative approach, electroencephalograph (EEG) signals recorded non-invasively from the brain have been utilized to decode the LMIs of humans. However, most of the existing EEG based limb movement decoding methods primarily focus on identifying limited classes of upper limb movements. In addition, investigation on EEG feature extraction methods for the decoding of multiple classes of LMIs has rarely been considered. Therefore, 32 EEG feature extraction methods (including 12 spectral domain descriptors (SDDs) and 20 time domain descriptors (TDDs)) were used to decode multiple classes of motor imagery patterns associated with different upper limb movements based on 64-channel EEG recordings. From the obtained experimental results, the best individual TDD achieved an accuracy of 67.05 ± 3.12% as against 87.03 ± 2.26% for the best SDD. By applying a linear feature combination technique, an optimal set of combined TDDs recorded an average accuracy of 90.68% while that of the SDDs achieved an accuracy of 99.55% which were significantly higher than those of the individual TDD and SDD at p < 0.05. Our findings suggest that optimal feature set combination would yield a relatively high decoding accuracy that may improve the clinical robustness of MDoF neuroprosthesis. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Institutional Review Board of Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, and the reference number is SIAT-IRB-150515-H0077."
29075937,"The challenges of research into brain-computer interfaces (BCI) include significant individual differences in learning pace and in the effective operation of BCI devices. The use of neurofeedback training is a popular method of improving the effectiveness BCI operation. The purpose of the present study was to determine to what extent it is possible to improve the effectiveness of operation of sensorimotor rhythm-based brain-computer interfaces (SMR-BCI) by supplementing user training with elements modifying the characteristics of visual feedback. Four experimental groups had training designed to reinforce BCI control by: visual feedback in the form of dummy faces expressing emotions (Group 1); flashing the principal elements of visual feedback (Group 2) and giving both visual feedbacks in one condition (Group 3). The fourth group participated in training with no modifications (Group 4). Training consisted of a series of trials where the subjects directed a ball into a basket located to the right or left side of the screen. In Group 1 a schematic image a face, placed on the controlled object, showed various emotions, depending on the accuracy of control. In Group 2, the cue and targets were flashed with different frequency (4 Hz) than the remaining elements visible on the monitor. Both modifications were also used simultaneously in Group 3. SMR activity during the task was recorded before and after the training. In Group 3 there was a significant improvement in SMR control, compared to subjects in Group 2 and 4 (control). Differences between subjects in Groups 1, 2 and 4 (control) were insignificant. This means that relatively small changes in the training procedure may significantly impact the effectiveness of BCI control. Analysis of behavioural data acquired from all participants at training showed greater effectiveness in directing the object towards the right side of the screen. Subjects with the greatest improvement in SMR control showed a significantly lower difference in the accuracy of rightward and leftward movement than others."
29065590,"Numerous EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems that are being developed focus on novel feature extraction algorithms, classification methods and combining existing approaches to create hybrid BCIs. Several recent studies demonstrated various advantages of hybrid BCI systems in terms of an improved accuracy or number of commands available for the user. But still, BCI systems are far from realization for daily use. Having high performance with less number of channels is one of the challenging issues that persists, especially with hybrid BCI systems, where multiple channels are necessary to record information from two or more EEG signal components. Therefore, this work proposes a single-channel (C3 or C4) hybrid BCI system that combines motor imagery (MI) and steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) approaches. This study demonstrates that besides MI features, SSVEP features can also be captured from C3 or C4 channel. The results show that due to rich feature information (MI and SSVEP) at these channels, the proposed hybrid BCI system outperforms both MI- and SSVEP-based systems having an average classification accuracy of 85.6 ± 7.7% in a two-class task."
29060521,"Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) offer individuals suffering from major disabilities an alternative method to interact with their environment. Sensorimotor rhythm (SMRs) based BCIs can successfully perform control tasks; however, the traditional SMR paradigms intuitively disconnect the control and real task, making them non-ideal for complex control scenarios. In this study we design a new, intuitively connected motor imagery (MI) paradigm using hierarchical common spatial patterns (HCSP) and context information to effectively predict intended hand grasps from electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Experiments with 5 participants yielded an aggregate classification accuracy-intended grasp prediction probability-of 64.5% for 8 different hand gestures, more than 5 times the chance level."
29060520,"The Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) algorithm had been shown to be effective in performing multi-class Electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding of motor imagery using the one-versus-the-rest approach on the BCI Competition IV Dataset IIa. In this paper, we propose a method to reduce false detection rates of decoding through a rejection option based on the difference in the posterior probability computed by the Naïve Bayesian classifier. We applied the proposed approach on the BCI Competition IV Dataset IIa, and the results showed a decrease in the false detection rates from 34.6 % to 6.9%, while average decoded trials decreased from 93.2% to 34.2% using a rejection threshold between 0.1 and 0.9. We subsequently formulated a method to optimize the rejection threshold based on the maximum F<sub>0.5</sub> score. The optimal rejection threshold yielded an average decrease in false detection rate to 19.1% with an average of 67.5% of trials decoded. The results showed the feasibility of decreasing false detection rates at a cost of rejection. Nevertheless, the results suggest that the use of reject option (RO) may be used as a training feedback system to train subjects' overt and covert EEG control strategies for better (dexterity and safety) continuous control of external device."
29060495,"Performance of motor imagery based brain-computer interfaces (MI BCIs) greatly depends on how to extract the features. Various versions of filter-bank based common spatial pattern have been proposed and used in MI BCIs. Filter-bank based common spatial pattern has more number of features compared with original common spatial pattern. As the number of features increases, the MI BCIs using filter-bank based common spatial pattern can face overfitting problems. In this study, we used eigenvector centrality feature selection method, wavelet packet decomposition common spatial pattern, and kernel extreme learning machine to improve the performance of MI BCIs and avoid overfitting problems. Furthermore, the computational speed was improved by using kernel extreme learning machine."
29060311,"Traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) is widely used classification method for brain-computer interface (BCI). However, SVM has a high computational complexity. In this paper, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based training data reduction is proposed to reduce high computational complexity. The proposed method is configured as follows: First, wavelet-based combined feature vectors are applied for motor imagery electroencephalography (EEG) identification and principal component analysis (PCA) are used to reduce the dimension of feature vectors. Thereafter, the GMM is implemented to reduce training data sizes. Finally, a nonlinear SVM classifier is used to classify the reduced training data. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using three different motor imagery datasets in terms of accuracy and training time. The results from the study indicate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy with faster computational time in motor imagery EEG classification."
29060310,"The accurate classification of the electroencephalography (EEG) signals is the most important task towards the development of a reliable motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) system. In this study, we utilized a publically available BCI Competition-IV 2008 dataset IIa. This study address to the binary classification problem of the motor imagery EEG data by using a sigmoid activation function-based extreme learning machines (ELM). We proposed a novel method of extracting the features from the EEG signals by first applying the independent component analysis (ICA) on the time series data and transforming the ICA time series data into Fourier domain and then extract the phase information from the Fourier spectrum. This phase information was further used to calculate the maximized cross-correlation connectivity matrix. The upper diagonal of this matrix was then vectorized and it serves as the basic feature for the ELM classification framework. By using the phase-only features we achieved 97.80% (p <; 0.0022) nested cross-validated classification accuracy. In addition, this process is relatively computationally inexpensive. Thus, it can be an excellent candidate for the motor imagery BCI applications."
29060309,"Several recent studies demonstrate the possibility of using user initiated covert speech mental tasks in brain computer interfaces with varying degrees of success, but details of the best frequency features had not been investigated. In this work, ten volunteers in the age range of 22-70 years participated in the experiment. Eight of them were neurologically healthy, one user was dyslexic, and another was autistic. The four words ""back"", ""forward"", ""left"", and ""right"" were shortened into ""BA"", ""FO"", ""LE"", and ""RY"", which are phonetically dissimilar and cognitively relevant directional commands. Participants were asked to covertly speak each as soon as the letters appeared on a screen. Volunteers completed five recording runs. During each run the four words were presented in random succession to avoid sequence bias. The recorded EEG data from the ten users were analysed to discover the best features within a Gabor Transform of the signals, i.e., those yielding the highest word-pair classification accuracy for this specific type of linguistic mental activity. Using this BCI, suitable class separability of covert speech tasks is confirmed for all, including disabled users, with consistently high classification accuracy from 72% to 88% in all cases. Like motor imagery tasks, Alpha and Beta band activity were found to contain 12% and 31% of the most important features respectively. Gamma band activity, which indicates high mental functions, contains 57% of the most important features in this study."
29060078,"Motor imagery (MI) has been widely used in neurorehabilitation and brain computer interface. The size of event-related desynchronization (ERD) is a key parameter for successful motor imaginary rehabilitation and BCI adaptation. Many studies have used visual guidance for enhancement/ amplification of motor imagery ERD amplitude, but their enhancements were not significant. We propose a novel ERD enhancing paradigm using body-ownership illusion, or also known as rubber hand illusion (RHI). The system was made by motorized, moving rubber hand which can simulate wrist extension. The amplifying effects of the proposed RHI paradigm were evaluated by comparing ERD sizes of the proposed paradigm with motor imagery and actual motor execution paradigms. The comparison result shows that the improvement of ERD size due to the proposed paradigm was statistically significant (p<;0.05) compared with the other paradigms."
29060050,"Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) serve as an integration tool between acquired brain signals and external devices. Precise classification of the acquired brain signals with the least misclassification error is an arduous task. Existing techniques for classification of multi-class motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) have low accuracy and are computationally inefficient. This paper introduces a classification algorithm, which uses two frequency ranges, mu and beta rythms, for feature extraction using common spatial pattern (CSP) along with support vector machine (SVM) for classification. The technique uses only four frequency bands with no feature reduction and consequently less computational cost. The implementation of this algorithm on BCI competition III dataset IIIa, resulted in the highest classification accuracy in comparison to existing algorithms. A mean accuracy of 85.5 for offline classification has been achieved using this technique."
29060046,"Motor Imagery based BCIs (MI-BCIs) allow the control of devices and communication by imagining different mental tasks. Despite many years of research, BCIs are still not the most accurate systems to control applications, due to two main factors: signal processing with classification, and users. It is admitted that BCI control involves certain characteristics and abilities in its users for optimal results. In this study, spatial abilities are evaluated in relation to MI-BCI control regarding flexion and extension mental tasks. Results show considerable correlation (r=0.49) between block design test (visual motor execution and spatial visualization) and extension-rest tasks. Additionally, rotation test (mental rotation task) presents significant correlation (r=0.56) to flexion-rest tasks."
29060043,"In this research a new method of wheelchair control using a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is proposed, in an attempt to bridge the gap between in-lab and real life applications, we believe it would provide a high level control over the BCI instead of the normal low level commands. It is anticipated to emphasis on mu rhythm to provide the control signals. The wheelchair is equipped with a mapping system, which scans the area and provides a map containing information about the user's current location and next possible destinations, then provides an optimized list of possible trajectories to reach the destination. The paradigm allows users to control the interface using motor imagery and issue commands to switch between possible trajectories and then confirm the choice. Commands trigger the motion of the wheelchair to the intended destination using a user selected path with speed up to 0.5 m/s. The interface also allows the user to interact with different robots through a common robotic system. Evaluation results indicate that this paradigm is indeed usable and could lead to promising outcomes."
29055718,"Neurofeedback of event-related desynchronization (ERD) in electroencephalograms (EEG) of the sensorimotor cortex (SM1) using a brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm is a powerful tool to promote motor recovery from post-stroke hemiplegia. However, the feedback delay attenuates the degree of motor learning and neural plasticity. The present study aimed to shorten the delay time to estimate amplitude modulation of the motor-imagery-related alpha and beta SM1-ERD using a lock-in amplifier (LIA) algorithm. The delay time was evaluated by calculating the value of the maximal correlation coefficient (MCC) between the time-series trace of ERDs extracted by the online LIA algorithm and those identified by an offline algorithm with the Hilbert transform (HT). The MCC and delay values used to estimate the ERDs calculated by the LIA were 0.89±0.032 and 200±9.49ms, respectively. The delay time and MCC values were significantly improved compared with those calculated by the conventional fast Fourier transformation (FFT), continuous Wavelet transformation (CWT), and autoregressive (AR) algorithms. Moreover, the coefficients of variance of the delay time and MCC values across trials were significantly lower in the LIA compared with the FFT, CWT, and AR algorithms. These results indicate that the LIA improved the detection delay, accuracy, and stability for estimating amplitude modulation of motor-related SM1-ERD. This would be beneficial for BCI paradigms to facilitate neurorehabilitation in patients with motor deficits."
29051688,"Motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) has been proposed as a rehabilitation tool to facilitate motor recovery in stroke. However, the calibration of a BCI system is a time-consuming and fatiguing process for stroke patients, which leaves reduced time for actual therapeutic interaction. Studies have shown that passive movement (PM) (i.e., the execution of a movement by an external agency without any voluntary motions) and motor imagery (MI) (i.e., the mental rehearsal of a movement without any activation of the muscles) induce similar EEG patterns over the motor cortex. Since performing PM is less fatiguing for the patients, this paper investigates the effectiveness of calibrating MI-BCIs from PM for stroke subjects in terms of classification accuracy. For this purpose, a new adaptive algorithm called filter bank data space adaptation (FB-DSA) is proposed. The FB-DSA algorithm linearly transforms the band-pass-filtered MI data such that the distribution difference between the MI and PM data is minimized. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by an offline study on data collected from 16 healthy subjects and 6 stroke patients. The results show that the proposed FB-DSA algorithm significantly improved the classification accuracies of the PM and MI calibrated models (<i>p</i> < 0.05). According to the obtained classification accuracies, the PM calibrated models that were adapted using the proposed FB-DSA algorithm outperformed the MI calibrated models by an average of 2.3 and 4.5 % for the healthy and stroke subjects respectively. In addition, our results suggest that the disparity between MI and PM could be stronger in the stroke patients compared to the healthy subjects, and there would be thus an increased need to use the proposed FB-DSA algorithm in BCI-based stroke rehabilitation calibrated from PM."
29046111,"To develop subject-specific classifier to recognize mental states fast and reliably is an important issue in brain-computer interfaces (BCI), particularly in practical real-time applications such as wheelchair or neuroprosthetic control. In this paper, a sequential decision-making strategy is explored in conjunction with an optimal wavelet analysis for EEG classification. The subject-specific wavelet parameters based on a grid-search method were first developed to determine evidence accumulative curve for the sequential classifier. Then we proposed a new method to set the two constrained thresholds in the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) based on the cumulative curve and a desired expected stopping time. As a result, it balanced the decision time of each class, and we term it balanced threshold SPRT (BTSPRT). The properties of the method were illustrated on 14 subjects' recordings from offline and online tests. Results showed the average maximum accuracy of the proposed method to be 83.4% and the average decision time of 2.77[Formula: see text]s, when compared with 79.2% accuracy and a decision time of 3.01[Formula: see text]s for the sequential Bayesian (SB) method. The BTSPRT method not only improves the classification accuracy and decision speed comparing with the other nonsequential or SB methods, but also provides an explicit relationship between stopping time, thresholds and error, which is important for balancing the speed-accuracy tradeoff. These results suggest that BTSPRT would be useful in explicitly adjusting the tradeoff between rapid decision-making and error-free device control."
29031463,"Many studies have demonstrated that training utilizing action observation and/or motor imagery improves motor performance. These two techniques are widely used in sports and in the rehabilitation of movement-related disorders. Motor imagery has also been used for brain-machine/computer interfaces (BMI/BCI). During both action observation and motor imagery, motor-related regions such as the premotor cortex and inferior parietal lobule are activated. This is common to actual execution and are involved with the underlying mechanisms of motor learning without execution. Since it is easier to record brain activity during action observation and motor imagery than that during actual sport movements, action observation, and motor imagery of sports skills or complex whole body movements have been utilized to investigate how neural mechanisms differ across the performance spectrum ranging from beginner to expert. However, brain activity during action observation and motor imagery is influenced by task complexity (i.e., simple vs complex movements). Furthermore, temporal changes in brain activity during actual execution along the long time course of motor learning are likely nonlinear and would be different from that during action observation or motor imagery. Activity in motor-related regions during action observation and motor imagery is typically greater in experts than in nonexperts, while the activity during actual execution is often smaller in experts than in nonexperts."
28991172,"In this paper, we propose a set of wavelet-based combined feature vectors and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-supervector to enhance training speed and classification accuracy in motor imagery brain-computer interfaces. The proposed method is configured as follows: first, wavelet transforms are applied to extract the feature vectors for identification of motor imagery electroencephalography (EEG) and principal component analyses are used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors and linearly combine them. Subsequently, the GMM universal background model is trained by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to purify the training data and reduce its size. Finally, a purified and reduced GMM-supervector is used to train the support vector machine classifier. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated for three different motor imagery datasets in terms of accuracy, kappa, mutual information, and computation time, and compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. The results from the study indicate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy with a small amount of training data compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms in motor imagery EEG classification."
28981418,"Motor imagery is widely used in the brain-computer interface (BCI) systems that can help people actively control devices to directly communicate with the external world, but its training and performance effect is usually poor for normal people. To improve operators' BCI performances, here we proposed a novel paradigm, which combined the covert verb reading in the traditional motor imagery paradigm. In our proposed paradigm, participants were asked to covertly read the presented verbs during imagining right hand or foot movements referred by those verbs. EEG signals were recorded with both our proposed paradigm and the traditional paradigm. By the common spatial pattern method, we, respectively, decomposed these signals into spatial patterns and extracted their features used in the following classification of support vector machine. Compared with the traditional paradigm, our proposed paradigm could generate clearer spatial patterns following a somatotopic distribution, which led to more distinguishable features and higher classification accuracies than those in the traditional paradigm. These results suggested that semantic processing of verbs can influence the brain activity of motor imagery and enhance the mu event-related desynchronisation. The combination of semantic processing with motor imagery is therefore a promising method for the improvement of operators' BCI performances."
28964180,"Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based motor imagery (MI) brain-computer interface (BCI) has shown its effectiveness for the control of rehabilitation devices designed for large body parts of the patients with neurologic impairments. In order to validate the feasibility of using EEG to decode the MI of a single index finger and constructing a BCI-enhanced finger rehabilitation system, we collected EEG data during right hand index finger MI and rest state for five healthy subjects and proposed a pattern recognition approach for classifying these two mental states. First, Fisher's linear discriminant criteria and power spectral density analysis were used to analyze the event-related desynchronization patterns. Second, both band power and approximate entropy were extracted as features. Third, aiming to eliminate the abnormal samples in the dictionary and improve the classification performance of the conventional sparse representation-based classification (SRC) method, we proposed a novel dictionary cleaned sparse representation-based classification (DCSRC) method for final classification. The experimental results show that the proposed DCSRC method gives better classification accuracies than SRC and an average classification accuracy of 81.32% is obtained for five subjects. Thus, it is demonstrated that single right hand index finger MI can be decoded from the sensorimotor rhythms, and the feature patterns of index finger MI and rest state can be well recognized for robotic exoskeleton initiation."
28961119,"For the last few years, many feature extraction methods have been proposed based on biological signals. Among these, the brain signals have the advantage that they can be obtained, even by people with peripheral nervous system damage. Motor imagery electroencephalograms (EEG) are inexpensive to measure, offer a high temporal resolution, and are intuitive. Therefore, these have received a significant amount of attention in various fields, including signal processing, cognitive science, and medicine. The common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is a useful method for feature extraction from motor imagery EEG. However, performance degradation occurs in a small-sample setting (SSS), because the CSP depends on sample-based covariance. Since the active frequency range is different for each subject, it is also inconvenient to set the frequency range to be different every time. In this paper, we propose the feature extraction method based on a filter bank to solve these problems. The proposed method consists of five steps. First, motor imagery EEG is divided by a using filter bank. Second, the regularized CSP (R-CSP) is applied to the divided EEG. Third, we select the features according to mutual information based on the individual feature algorithm. Fourth, parameter sets are selected for the ensemble. Finally, we classify using ensemble based on features. The brain-computer interface competition III data set IVa is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The proposed method improves the mean classification accuracy by 12.34%, 11.57%, 9%, 4.95%, and 4.47% compared with CSP, SR-CSP, R-CSP, filter bank CSP (FBCSP), and SR-FBCSP. Compared with the filter bank R-CSP ( , ), which is a parameter selection version of the proposed method, the classification accuracy is improved by 3.49%. In particular, the proposed method shows a large improvement in performance in the SSS."
28948168,"Advances in neural interfaces have demonstrated remarkable results in the direction of replacing and restoring lost sensorimotor function in human patients. Noninvasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are popular due to considerable advantages including simplicity, safety, and low cost, while recent advances aim at improving past technological and neurophysiological limitations. Taking into account the neurophysiological alterations of disabled individuals, investigating brain connectivity features for implementation of BCI control holds special importance. Off-the-shelf BCI systems are based on fast, reproducible detection of mental activity and can be implemented in neurorobotic applications. Moreover, social Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is increasingly important in rehabilitation robotics development. In this paper, we present our progress and goals towards developing off-the-shelf BCI-controlled anthropomorphic robotic arms for assistive technologies and rehabilitation applications. We account for robotics development, BCI implementation, and qualitative assessment of HRI characteristics of the system. Furthermore, we present two illustrative experimental applications of the BCI-controlled arms, a study of motor imagery modalities on healthy individuals' BCI performance, and a pilot investigation on spinal cord injured patients' BCI control and brain connectivity. We discuss strengths and limitations of our design and propose further steps on development and neurophysiological study, including implementation of connectivity features as BCI modality."
28926593,"Event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/S) is an electroencephalogram (EEG) feature widely used as control signals for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). Nevertheless, the underlying neural mechanisms and functions of ERD/S are largely unknown, thus investigating them is crucial to improve the reliability of ERD/S-based BCIs. This study aimed to identify Motor Imagery (MI) conditions that enhance ERD/S. We investigated following three questions: 1) whether target-directed MI affects ERD/S, 2) whether MI with sound imagery affects ERD/S, and 3) whether ERD/S has a body part dependency of MI. Nine participants took part in the experiments of four MI conditions; they were asked to imagine right foot dorsiflexion (F), right foot dorsiflexion and the sound of a bass drum when the sole touched the floor (FS), right leg extension (L), and right leg extension directed toward a soccer ball (LT). Statistical comparison revealed that there were significant differences between conditions L and LT in beta-band ERD and conditions F and L in beta-band ERS. These results suggest that mental rehearsal of target-directed lower limb movement without real sensory stimuli can enhance beta-band ERD; furthermore, MI of foot dorsiflexion induces significantly larger beta-band ERS than that of leg extension. These findings could be exploited for the training of BCIs such as powered prosthetics for disabled person and neurorehabilitation system for stroke patients."
28925374,"Task-induced amplitude modulation of neural oscillations is routinely used in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for decoding subjects' intents, and underlies some of the most robust and common methods in the field, such as common spatial patterns and Riemannian geometry. While there has been some interest in phase-related features for classification, both techniques usually presuppose that the frequencies of neural oscillations remain stable across various tasks. We investigate here whether features based on task-induced modulation of the frequency of neural oscillations enable decoding of subjects' intents with an accuracy comparable to task-induced amplitude modulation. We compare cross-validated classification accuracies using the amplitude and frequency modulated features, as well as a joint feature space, across subjects in various paradigms and pre-processing conditions. We show results with a motor imagery task, a cognitive task, and also preliminary results in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as well as using common spatial patterns and Laplacian filtering. The frequency features alone do not significantly out-perform traditional amplitude modulation features, and in some cases perform significantly worse. However, across both tasks and pre-processing in healthy subjects the joint space significantly out-performs either the frequency or amplitude features alone. This result only does not hold for ALS patients, for whom the dataset is of insufficient size to draw any statistically significant conclusions. Task-induced frequency modulation is robust and straight forward to compute, and increases performance when added to standard amplitude modulation features across paradigms. This allows more information to be extracted from the EEG signal cheaply and can be used throughout the field of BCIs."
28893295,"Motor imagery (MI) induced EEG patterns are widely used as control signals for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Kinetic and kinematic factors have been proved to be able to change EEG patterns during motor execution and motor imagery. However, to our knowledge, there is still no literature reporting an effective online MI-BCI using kinetic factor regulated EEG oscillations. This study proposed a novel MI-BCI paradigm in which users can online output multiple commands by imagining clenching their right hand with different force loads. Eleven subjects participated in this study. During the experiment, they were asked to imagine clenching their right hands with two different force loads (30% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and 10% MVC). Multi-Common spatial patterns (Multi-CSPs) and support vector machines (SVMs) were used to build the classifier for recognizing three commands corresponding to high load MI, low load MI and relaxed status respectively. EMG were monitored to avoid voluntary muscle activities during the BCI operation. The event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) method was used to analyse EEG variation during multiple load MI tasks. All subjects were able to drive BCI systems using motor imagery of different force loads in online experiments. We achieved an average online accuracy of 70.9%, with the highest accuracy of 83.3%, which was much higher than the chance level (33%). The event-related desynchronization (ERD) phenomenon during high load tasks was significantly higher than it was during low load tasks both in terms of intensity at electrode positions C3 (p < 0.05) and spatial distribution. This paper demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed MI-BCI paradigm based on multi-force loads on the same limb through online studies. This paradigm could not only enlarge the command set of MI-BCI, but also provide a promising approach to rehabilitate patients with motor disabilities."
28891513,"Common spatial pattern algorithm is widely used to estimate spatial filters in motor imagery based brain-computer interfaces. However, use of a large number of channels will make common spatial pattern tend to over-fitting and the classification of electroencephalographic signals time-consuming. To overcome these problems, it is necessary to choose an optimal subset of the whole channels to save computational time and improve the classification accuracy. In this paper, a novel method named backtracking search optimization algorithm is proposed to automatically select the optimal channel set for common spatial pattern. Each individual in the population is a N-dimensional vector, with each component representing one channel. A population of binary codes generate randomly in the beginning, and then channels are selected according to the evolution of these codes. The number and positions of 1's in the code denote the number and positions of chosen channels. The objective function of backtracking search optimization algorithm is defined as the combination of classification error rate and relative number of channels. Experimental results suggest that higher classification accuracy can be achieved with much fewer channels compared to standard common spatial pattern with whole channels."
28879007,"Restorative brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been proposed to enhance stroke rehabilitation. Restorative BCIs are able to close the sensorimotor loop by rewarding motor imagery (MI) with sensory feedback. Despite the promising results from early studies, reaching clinically significant outcomes in a timely fashion is yet to be achieved. This lack of efficacy may be due to suboptimal feedback provision. To the best of our knowledge, the optimal feedback update interval (FUI) during MI remains unexplored. There is evidence that sensory feedback disinhibits the motor cortex. Thus, in this study, we explore how shorter than usual FUIs affect behavioural and neurophysiological measures following BCI training for stroke patients using a single-case proof-of-principle study design. The action research arm test was used as the primary behavioural measure and showed a clinically significant increase (36%) over the course of training. The neurophysiological measures including motor evoked potentials and maximum voluntary contraction showed distinctive changes in early and late phases of BCI training. Thus, this preliminary study may pave the way for running larger studies to further investigate the effect of FUI magnitude on the efficacy of restorative BCIs. It may also elucidate the role of early and late phases of motor learning along the course of BCI training."
28874909,"Motor imagery (MI) electroencephalograph (EEG) signals are widely applied in brain-computer interface (BCI). However, classified MI states are limited, and their classification accuracy rates are low because of the characteristics of nonlinearity and nonstationarity. This study proposes a novel MI pattern recognition system that is based on complex algorithms for classifying MI EEG signals. In electrooculogram (EOG) artifact preprocessing, band-pass filtering is performed to obtain the frequency band of MI-related signals, and then, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) combined with wavelet threshold denoising (WTD) is used for EOG artifact preprocessing. We propose a regularized common spatial pattern (R-CSP) algorithm for EEG feature extraction by incorporating the principle of generic learning. A new classifier combining the <i>K</i>-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) approaches is used to classify four anisomerous states, namely, imaginary movements with the left hand, right foot, and right shoulder and the resting state. The highest classification accuracy rate is 92.5%, and the average classification accuracy rate is 87%. The proposed complex algorithm identification method can significantly improve the identification rate of the minority samples and the overall classification performance."
28860986,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are an emerging technology that are capable of turning brain electrical activity into commands for an external device. Motor imagery (MI)-when a person imagines a motion without executing it-is widely employed in BCI devices for motor control because of the endogenous origin of its neural control mechanisms, and the similarity in brain activation to actual movements. Challenges with translating a MI-BCI into a practical device used outside laboratories include the extensive training required, often due to poor user engagement and visual feedback response delays; poor user flexibility/freedom to time the execution/inhibition of their movements, and to control the movement type (right arm vs. left leg) and characteristics (reaching vs. grabbing); and high false positive rates of motion control. Solutions to improve sensorimotor activation and user performance of MI-BCIs have been explored. Virtual reality (VR) motor-execution tasks have replaced simpler visual feedback (smiling faces, arrows) and have solved this problem to an extent. Hybrid BCIs (hBCIs) implementing an additional control signal to MI have improved user control capabilities to a limited extent. These hBCIs either fail to allow the patients to gain asynchronous control of their movements, or have a high false positive rate. We propose an immersive VR environment which provides visual feedback that is both engaging and immediate, but also uniquely engages a different cognitive process in the patient that generates event-related potentials (ERPs). These ERPs provide a key executive function for the users to execute/inhibit movements. Additionally, we propose signal processing strategies and machine learning algorithms to move BCIs toward developing long-term signal stability in patients with distinctive brain signals and capabilities to control motor signals. The hBCI itself and the VR environment we propose would help to move BCI technology outside laboratory environments for motor rehabilitation in hospitals, and potentially for controlling a prosthetic."
28859916,"A peripherally generated afferent volley that arrives at the peak negative (PN) phase during the movement related cortical potential (MRCP) induces significant plasticity at the cortical level in healthy individuals and chronic stroke patients. Transferring this type of associative brain-computer interface (BCI) intervention into the clinical setting requires that the proprioceptive input is comparable to the techniques implemented during the rehabilitation process. These consist mainly of functional electrical stimulation (FES) and passive movement induced by an actuated orthosis. In this study, we compared these two interventions (BCI<sub>FES</sub> and BCI<sub>passive</sub>) where the afferent input was timed to arrive at the motor cortex during the PN of the MRCP. Twelve healthy participants attended two experimental sessions. They were asked to perform 30 dorsiflexion movements timed to a cue while continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) data were collected from FP1, Fz, FC1, FC2, C3, Cz, C4, CP1, CP2, and Pz, according to the standard international 10-20 system. MRCPs were extracted and the PN time calculated. Next, participants were asked to imagine the same movement 30 times while either FES (frequency: 20Hz, intensity: 8-35mAmp) or a passive ankle movement (amplitude and velocity matched to a normal gait cycle) was applied such that the first afferent inflow would coincide with the PN of the MRCP. The change in the output of the primary motor cortex (M1) was quantified by applying single transcranial magnetic stimuli to the area of M1 controlling the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle and measuring the motor evoked potential (MEP). Spinal changes were assessed pre and post by eliciting the TA stretch reflex. Both BCI<sub>FES</sub> and BCI<sub>passive</sub> led to significant increases in the excitability of the cortical projections to TA (F<sub>(2,22)</sub>=4.44, p=0.024) without any concomitant changes at the spinal level. These effects were still present 30min after the cessation of both interventions. There was no significant main effect of intervention, F<sub>(1,11)</sub>=0.38, p=0.550, indicating that the changes in MEP occurred independently of the type of afferent inflow. An afferent volley generated from a passive movement or an electrical stimulus arrives at the somatosensory cortex at similar times. It is thus likely that the similar effects observed here are strictly due to the tight coupling in time between the afferent inflow and the PN of the MRCP. This provides further support to the associative nature of the proposed BCI system."
28841920,"Motor planning, imagery or execution is associated with event-related desynchronization (ERD) of mu rhythm oscillations (8-13 Hz) recordable over sensorimotor areas using electroencephalography (EEG). It was shown that motor imagery involving distal muscles, e.g. finger movements, results in contralateral ERD correlating with increased excitability of the contralateral corticospinal tract (c-CST). Following the rationale that purposefully increasing c-CST excitability might facilitate motor recovery after stroke, ERD recently became an attractive target for brain-computer interface (BCI)-based neurorehabilitation training. It was unclear, however, whether ERD would also reflect excitability of the ipsilateral corticospinal tract (i-CST) that mainly innervates proximal muscles involved in e.g. shoulder movements. Such knowledge would be important to optimize and extend ERD-based BCI neurorehabilitation protocols, e.g. to restore shoulder movements after stroke. Here we used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) targeting the ipsilateral primary motor cortex to elicit motor evoked potentials (MEPs) of the trapezius muscle. To assess whether ERD reflects excitability of the i-CST, a correlation analysis between between MEP amplitudes and ipsilateral ERD was performed. Experiment 1 consisted of a motor execution task during which 10 healthy volunteers performed elevations of the shoulder girdle or finger pinching while a 128-channel EEG was recorded. Experiment 2 consisted of a motor imagery task during which 16 healthy volunteers imagined shoulder girdle elevations or finger pinching while an EEG was recorded; the participants simultaneously received randomly timed, single-pulse TMS to the ipsilateral primary motor cortex. The spatial pattern and amplitude of ERD and the amplitude of the agonist muscle's TMS-induced MEPs were analyzed. ERDs occurred bilaterally during both execution and imagery of shoulder girdle elevations, but were lateralized to the contralateral hemisphere during finger pinching. We found that trapezius MEPs increased during motor imagery of shoulder elevations and correlated with ipsilateral ERD amplitudes. Ipsilateral ERD during execution and imagery of shoulder girdle elevations appears to reflect the excitability of uncrossed pathways projecting to the shoulder muscles. As such, ipsilateral ERD could be used for neurofeedback training of shoulder movement, aiming at reanimation of the i-CST."
28835651,"Brain-computer interface-assisted motor imagery (MI-BCI) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been used in stroke rehabilitation, though their combinatory effect is unknown. We investigated brain plasticity following a combined MI-BCI and tDCS intervention in chronic subcortical stroke patients with unilateral upper limb disability. Nineteen patients were randomized into tDCS and sham-tDCS groups. Diffusion and perfusion MRI, and transcranial magnetic stimulation were used to study structural connectivity, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and corticospinal excitability, respectively, before and 4 weeks after the 2-week intervention. After quality control, thirteen subjects were included in the CBF analysis. Eleven healthy controls underwent 2 sessions of MRI for reproducibility study. Whereas motor performance showed comparable improvement, long-lasting neuroplasticity can only be detected in the tDCS group, where white matter integrity in the ipsilesional corticospinal tract and bilateral corpus callosum was increased but sensorimotor CBF was decreased, particularly in the ipsilesional side. CBF change in the bilateral parietal cortices also correlated with motor function improvement, consistent with the increased white matter integrity in the corpus callosum connecting these regions, suggesting an involvement of interhemispheric interaction. The preliminary results indicate that tDCS may facilitate neuroplasticity and suggest the potential for refining rehabilitation strategies for stroke patients."
28832513,"This paper presents an EEG-based brain-computer interface system for classifying eleven motor imagery (MI) tasks within the same hand. The proposed system utilizes the Choi-Williams time-frequency distribution (CWD) to construct a time-frequency representation (TFR) of the EEG signals. The constructed TFR is used to extract five categories of time-frequency features (TFFs). The TFFs are processed using a hierarchical classification model to identify the MI task encapsulated within the EEG signals. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, EEG data were recorded for eighteen intact subjects and four amputated subjects while imagining to perform each of the eleven hand MI tasks. Two performance evaluation analyses, namely channel- and TFF-based analyses, are conducted to identify the best subset of EEG channels and the TFFs category, respectively, that enable the highest classification accuracy between the MI tasks. In each evaluation analysis, the hierarchical classification model is trained using two training procedures, namely subject-dependent and subject-independent procedures. These two training procedures quantify the capability of the proposed approach to capture both intra- and inter-personal variations in the EEG signals for different MI tasks within the same hand. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach for classifying the MI tasks within the same hand. In particular, the classification accuracies obtained for the intact and amputated subjects are as high as 88 . 8 % and 90 . 2 % , respectively, for the subject-dependent training procedure, and 80 . 8 % and 87 . 8 % , respectively, for the subject-independent training procedure. These results suggest the feasibility of applying the proposed approach to control dexterous prosthetic hands, which can be of great benefit for individuals suffering from hand amputations."
28830308,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for communication can be nonintuitive, often requiring the performance of hand motor imagery or some other conversation-irrelevant task. In this paper, electroencephalography (EEG) was used to develop two intuitive online BCIs based solely on covert speech. The goal of the first BCI was to differentiate between 10[Formula: see text]s of mental repetitions of the word ""no"" and an equivalent duration of unconstrained rest. The second BCI was designed to discern between 10[Formula: see text]s each of covert repetition of the words ""yes"" and ""no"". Twelve participants used these two BCIs to answer yes or no questions. Each participant completed four sessions, comprising two offline training sessions and two online sessions, one for testing each of the BCIs. With a support vector machine and a combination of spectral and time-frequency features, an average accuracy of [Formula: see text] was reached across participants in the online classification of no versus rest, with 10 out of 12 participants surpassing the chance level (60.0% for [Formula: see text]). The online classification of yes versus no yielded an average accuracy of [Formula: see text], with eight participants exceeding the chance level. Task-specific changes in EEG beta and gamma power in language-related brain areas tended to provide discriminatory information. To our knowledge, this is the first report of online EEG classification of covert speech. Our findings support further study of covert speech as a BCI activation task, potentially leading to the development of more intuitive BCIs for communication."
28813921,"Transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS) is a technique for modulating brain excitability that has potential to be used in motor neurorehabilitation by enhancing motor activity, such as motor imagery (MI). tDCS effects depend on different factors, like current density and the position of the stimulating electrodes. This study presents preliminary results of the evaluation of the effect of current density on MI performance by measuring right-hand/feet MI accuracy of classification from electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements after anodal tDCS is applied with a 4×1 ring montage over the right-hand or feet motor cortex. Results suggest that there might be an enhancement of feet MI when tDCS is applied over the right-hand motor cortex, but further evaluation is required. If results are confirmed with a larger sample, the montage could be used to optimize feet MI performance and improve the outcome of MI-based brain-computer interfaces, which are used during motor neurorehabilitation."
28813231,"To study the physiologic mechanism of the brain during different motor imagery (MI) tasks, the authors employed a method of brain-network modeling based on time-frequency cross mutual information obtained from 4-class (left hand, right hand, feet, and tongue) MI tasks recorded as brain-computer interface (BCI) electroencephalography data. The authors explored the brain network revealed by these MI tasks using statistical analysis and the analysis of topologic characteristics, and observed significant differences in the reaction level, reaction time, and activated target during 4-class MI tasks. There was a great difference in the reaction level between the execution and resting states during different tasks: the reaction level of the left-hand MI task was the greatest, followed by that of the right-hand, feet, and tongue MI tasks. The reaction time required to perform the tasks also differed: during the left-hand and right-hand MI tasks, the brain networks of subjects reacted promptly and strongly, but there was a delay during the feet and tongue MI task. Statistical analysis and the analysis of network topology revealed the target regions of the brain network during different MI processes. In conclusion, our findings suggest a new way to explain the neural mechanism behind MI."
28809705,"Feedback plays a crucial role for using brain computer interface systems. This paper proposes the use of vibration-evoked kinaesthetic illusions as part of a novel multisensory feedback for a motor imagery (MI)-based BCI and investigates its contributions in terms of BCI performance and electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates. sixteen subjects performed two different right arm MI-BCI sessions: with the visual feedback only and with both visual and vibration-evoked kinaesthetic feedback, conveyed by the stimulation of the biceps brachi tendon. In both conditions, the sensory feedback was driven by the MI-BCI. The rich and more natural multisensory feedback was expected to facilitate the execution of MI, and thus to improve the performance of the BCI. The EEG correlates of the proposed feedback were also investigated with and without the performing of MI. the contribution of vibration-evoked kinaesthetic feedback led to statistically higher BCI performance (Anova, F<sub>(1,14)</sub> = 18.1, p < .01) and more stable EEG event-related-desynchronization. Obtained results suggest promising application of the proposed method in neuro-rehabilitation scenarios: the advantage of an improved usability could make the MI-BCIs more applicable for those patients having difficulties in performing kinaesthetic imagery."
28804712,"Motor-imagery tasks are a popular input method for controlling brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), partially due to their similarities to naturally produced motor signals. The use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in BCIs is still emerging and has shown potential as a supplement or replacement for electroencephalography. However, studies often use only two or three motor-imagery tasks, limiting the number of available commands. In this work, we present the results of the first four-class motor-imagery-based online fNIRS-BCI for robot control. Thirteen participants utilized upper- and lower-limb motor-imagery tasks (left hand, right hand, left foot, and right foot) that were mapped to four high-level commands (turn left, turn right, move forward, and move backward) to control the navigation of a simulated or real robot. A significant improvement in classification accuracy was found between the virtual-robot-based BCI (control of a virtual robot) and the physical-robot BCI (control of the DARwIn-OP humanoid robot). Differences were also found in the oxygenated hemoglobin activation patterns of the four tasks between the first and second BCI. These results corroborate previous findings that motor imagery can be improved with feedback and imply that a four-class motor-imagery-based fNIRS-BCI could be feasible with sufficient subject training."
28785973,"The rhythm of electroencephalogram (EEG) depends on the neuroanatomical-based parameters such as white matter (WM) connectivity. However, the impacts of these parameters on the specific characteristics of EEG have not been clearly understood. Previous studies demonstrated that, these parameters contribute the inter-subject differences of EEG during performance of specific task such as motor imagery (MI). Though researchers have worked on this phenomenon, the idea is yet to be understood in terms of the mechanism that underlies such differences. Here, to tackle this issue, we began our investigations by first examining the structural features related to scalp EEG characteristics, which are event-related desynchronizations (ERDs), during MI using diffusion MRI. Twenty-four right-handed subjects were recruited to accomplish MI tasks and MRI scans. Based on the high spatial resolution of the structural and diffusion images, the motor-related WM links, such as basal ganglia (BG)-primary somatosensory cortex (SM1) pathway and supplementary motor area (SMA)-SM1 connection, were reconstructed by using probabilistic white matter tractography. Subsequently, the relationships of WM characteristics with EEG signals were investigated. These analyses demonstrated that WM pathway characteristics, including the connectivity strength and the positional characteristics of WM connectivity on SM1 (defined by the gyrus-sulcus ratio of connectivity, GSR), have a significant impact on ERDs when doing MI. Interestingly, the high GSR of WM connections between SM1 and BG were linked to the better ERDs. These results therefore, indicated that the connectivity in the gyrus of SM1 interacted with MI network which played the critical role for the scalp EEG signal extraction of MI to a great extent. The study provided the coupling mechanism between structural and dynamic physiological features of human brain, which would also contribute to understanding individual differences of EEG in MI-brain computer interface."
28775677,"Repeated use of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) providing contingent sensory feedback of brain activity was recently proposed as a rehabilitation approach to restore motor function after stroke or spinal cord lesions. However, there are only a few clinical studies that investigate feasibility and effectiveness of such an approach. Here we report on a placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial that investigated whether stroke survivors with severe upper limb (UL) paralysis benefit from 10 BCI training sessions each lasting up to 40 min. A total of 74 patients participated: median time since stroke is 8 months, 25 and 75% quartiles [3.0; 13.0]; median severity of UL paralysis is 4.5 points [0.0; 30.0] as measured by the Action Research Arm Test, ARAT, and 19.5 points [11.0; 40.0] as measured by the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment, FMMA. Patients in the BCI group (<i>n</i> = 55) performed motor imagery of opening their affected hand. Motor imagery-related brain electroencephalographic activity was translated into contingent hand exoskeleton-driven opening movements of the affected hand. In a control group (<i>n</i> = 19), hand exoskeleton-driven opening movements of the affected hand were independent of brain electroencephalographic activity. Evaluation of the UL clinical assessments indicated that both groups improved, but only the BCI group showed an improvement in the ARAT's grasp score from 0 [0.0; 14.0] to 3.0 [0.0; 15.0] points (<i>p</i> < 0.01) and pinch scores from 0.0 [0.0; 7.0] to 1.0 [0.0; 12.0] points (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Upon training completion, 21.8% and 36.4% of the patients in the BCI group improved their ARAT and FMMA scores respectively. The corresponding numbers for the control group were 5.1% (ARAT) and 15.8% (FMMA). These results suggests that adding BCI control to exoskeleton-assisted physical therapy can improve post-stroke rehabilitation outcomes. Both maximum and mean values of the percentage of successfully decoded imagery-related EEG activity, were higher than chance level. A correlation between the classification accuracy and the improvement in the upper extremity function was found. An improvement of motor function was found for patients with different duration, severity and location of the stroke."
28769781,"In this paper, a novel methodology for enhanced classification of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals utilizable in a two-class [motor imagery (MI) and rest; mental rotation (MR) and rest] brain-computer interface (BCI) is presented. First, fNIRS signals corresponding to MI and MR are acquired from the motor and prefrontal cortex, respectively, afterward, filtered to remove physiological noises. Then, the signals are modeled using the general linear model, the coefficients of which are adaptively estimated using the least squares technique. Subsequently, multiple feature combinations of estimated coefficients were used for classification. The best classification accuracies achieved for five subjects, for MI versus rest are 79.5, 83.7, 82.6, 81.4, and 84.1% whereas those for MR versus rest are 85.5, 85.2, 87.8, 83.7, and 84.8%, respectively, using support vector machine. These results are compared with the best classification accuracies obtained using the conventional hemodynamic response. By means of the proposed methodology, the average classification accuracy obtained was significantly higher (<i>p</i> < 0.05). These results serve to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a high-classification-performance fNIRS-BCI."
28769776,"Most brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) focus on detecting single aspects of user states (e.g., motor imagery) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) in order to use these aspects as control input for external systems. This communication can be effective, but unaccounted mental processes can interfere with signals used for classification and thereby introduce changes in the signal properties which could potentially impede BCI classification performance. To improve BCI performance, we propose deploying an approach that potentially allows to describe different mental states that could influence BCI performance. To test this approach, we analyzed neural signatures of potential affective states in data collected in a paradigm where the complex user state of perceived loss of control (LOC) was induced. In this article, source localization methods were used to identify brain dynamics with source located outside but affecting the signal of interest originating from the primary motor areas, pointing to interfering processes in the brain during natural human-machine interaction. In particular, we found affective correlates which were related to perceived LOC. We conclude that additional context information about the ongoing user state might help to improve the applicability of BCIs to real-world scenarios."
28740331,"Autoregressive (AR) models are of commonly utilized feature types in Electroencephalogram (EEG) studies due to offering better resolution, smoother spectra and being applicable to short segments of data. Identifying correct AR's modeling order is an open challenge. Lower model orders poorly represent the signal while higher orders increase noise. Conventional methods for estimating modeling order includes Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Final Prediction Error (FPE). This article assesses the hypothesis that appropriate mixture of multiple AR orders is likely to better represent the true signal compared to any single order. Better spectral representation of underlying EEG patterns can increase utility of AR features in Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems by increasing timely & correctly responsiveness of such systems to operator's thoughts. Two mechanisms of Evolutionary-based fusion and Ensemble-based mixture are utilized for identifying such appropriate mixture of modeling orders. The classification performance of the resultant AR-mixtures are assessed against several conventional methods utilized by the community including 1) A well-known set of commonly used orders suggested by the literature, 2) conventional order estimation approaches (e.g., AIC, BIC and FPE), 3) blind mixture of AR features originated from a range of well-known orders. Five datasets from BCI competition III that contain 2, 3 and 4 motor imagery tasks are considered for the assessment. The results indicate superiority of Ensemble-based modeling order mixture and evolutionary-based order fusion methods within all datasets."
28736662,"Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that a subgroup of patients diagnosed as being in a vegetative state are aware and able to communicate by performing a motor imagery task in response to commands. Due to the fMRI's cost and accessibility, there is a need for exploring different imaging modalities that can be used at the bedside. A promising technique is functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) that has been successfully applied to measure brain oxygenation in humans. Due to the limited depth sensitivity of continuous-wave NIRS, time-resolved (TR) detection has been proposed as a way of enhancing the sensitivity to the brain, since late arriving photons have a higher probability of reaching the brain. The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility and sensitivity of TR fNIRS in detecting brain activity during motor imagery. Fifteen healthy subjects were recruited in this study, and the fNIRS results were validated using fMRI. The change in the statistical moments of the distribution of times of flight (number of photons, mean time of flight and variance) were calculated for each channel to determine the presence of brain activity. The results indicate up to an 86% agreement between fMRI and TR-fNIRS and the sensitivity ranging from 64 to 93% with the highest value determined for the mean time of flight. These promising results highlight the potential of TR-fNIRS as a portable brain computer interface for patients with disorder of consciousness."
28729822,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a brain stimulation technique that can enhance motor activity by stimulating the motor path. Thus, tDCS has the potential of improving the performance of brain-computer interfaces during motor neurorehabilitation. tDCS effects depend on several aspects, including the current density, which usually varies between 0.02 and 0.08 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the location of the stimulation electrodes. Hence, testing tDCS montages at several current levels would allow the selection of current parameters for improving stimulation outcomes and the comparison of montages. In a previous study, we found that cortico-cerebellar tDCS shows potential of enhancing right-hand motor imagery. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the effects of the focal stimulation of the motor cortex over motor imagery. In particular, the effect of supplying tDCS with a 4 × 1 ring montage, which consists in placing an anode on the motor cortex and four cathodes around it, over motor imagery was assessed with different current densities. Electroencephalographic (EEG) classification into rest or right-hand/feet motor imagery was evaluated on five healthy subjects for two stimulation schemes: applying tDCS for 10 min on the (1) right-hand or (2) feet motor cortex before EEG recording. Accuracy differences related to the tDCS intensity, as well as μ and β band power changes, were tested for each subject and tDCS modality. In addition, a simulation of the electric field induced by the montage was used to describe its effect on the brain. Results show no improvement trends on classification for the evaluated currents, which is in accordance with the observation of variable EEG band power results despite the focused stimulation. The lack of effects is probably related to the underestimation of the current intensity required to apply a particular current density for small electrodes and the relatively short inter-electrode distance. Hence, higher current intensities should be evaluated in the future for this montage."
28718781,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are known to be vulnerable to variabilities in background states of a user. Usually, no detailed information on these states is available even during the training stage. Thus there is a need in a method which is capable of taking background states into account in an unsupervised way. We propose a latent variable method that is based on a probabilistic model with a discrete latent variable. In order to estimate the model's parameters, we suggest to use the expectation maximization algorithm. The proposed method is aimed at assessing characteristics of background states without any corresponding data labeling. In the context of asynchronous motor imagery paradigm, we applied this method to the real data from twelve able-bodied subjects with open/closed eyes serving as background states. We found that the latent variable method improved classification of target states compared to the baseline method (in seven of twelve subjects). In addition, we found that our method was also capable of background states recognition (in six of twelve subjects). Without any supervised information on background states, the latent variable method provides a way to improve classification in BCI by taking background states into account at the training stage and then by making decisions on target states weighted by posterior probabilities of background states at the prediction stage."
28715332,"The objective is to evaluate the impact of EEG referencing schemes and spherical surface Laplacian (SSL) methods on the classification performance of motor-imagery (MI)-related brain-computer interface systems. Two EEG referencing schemes: common referencing and common average referencing and three surface Laplacian methods: current source density (CSD), finite difference method, and SSL using realistic head model were implemented separately for pre-processing of the EEG signals recorded at the scalp. A combination of filter bank common spatial filter for features extraction and support vector machine for classification was used for both pairwise binary classifications and four-class classification of MI tasks. The study provides three major outcomes: 1) the CSD method performs better than CR, providing a significant improvement of 3.02% and 5.59% across six binary classification tasks and four-class classification task, respectively; 2) the combination of a greater number of channels at the pre-processing stage as compared with the feature extraction stage yields better classification accuracies for all the Laplacian methods; and 3) the efficiency of all the surface Laplacian methods reduced significantly in the case of a fewer number of channels considered during the pre-processing."
28713232,"The movement related cortical potential (MRCP), a slow cortical potential from the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG), has been used in real-time brain-computer-interface (BCI) systems designed for neurorehabilitation. Detecting MPCPs in real time with high accuracy and low latency is essential in these applications. In this study, we propose a new MRCP detection method based on constrained independent component analysis (cICA). The method was tested for MRCP detection during executed and imagined ankle dorsiflexion of 24 healthy participants, and compared with four commonly used spatial filters for MRCP detection in an offline experiment. The effect of cICA and the compared spatial filters on the morphology of the extracted MRCP was evaluated by two indices quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio and variability of the extracted MRCP. The performance of the filters for detection was then directly compared for accuracy and latency. The latency obtained with cICA (-34 ± 29 ms motor execution (ME) and 28 ± 16 ms for motor imagery (MI) dataset) was significantly smaller than with all other spatial filters. Moreover, cICA resulted in greater true positive rates (87.11 ± 11.73 for ME and 86.66 ± 6.96 for MI dataset) and lower false positive rates (20.69 ± 13.68 for ME and 19.31 ± 12.60 for MI dataset) compared to the other methods. These results confirm the superiority of cICA in MRCP detection with respect to previously proposed EEG filtering approaches."
28706472,"Brain computer interfaces provide a novel channel for the communication between brain and output devices. The effectiveness of the brain computer interface is based on the classification accuracy of single trial brain signals. The common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is believed to be an effective algorithm for the classification of single trial brain signals. As the amplitude feature for spatial projection applied by this algorithm is based on a broad frequency bandpass filter (mainly 5-30 Hz) in which the frequency band is often selected by experience, the CSP is sensitive to noise and the influence of other irrelevant information in the selected broad frequency band. In this paper, to improve the CSP, a novel relevant feature integration and extraction algorithm is proposed. Before projecting, we integrated the motor relevant information to suppress the interference of noise and irrelevant information, as well as to improve the spatial difference for projection. The algorithm was evaluated with public datasets. It showed significantly better classification performance with single trial electroencephalography (EEG) data, increasing by 6.8% compared with the CSP."
28696340,"Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have been proposed in closed-loop applications for neuromodulation and neurorehabilitation. This study describes the impact of different feedback modalities on the performance of an EEG-based BMI that decodes motor imagery (MI) of leg flexion and extension. We executed experiments in a lower-limb gait trainer (the legoPress) where nine able-bodied subjects participated in three consecutive sessions based on a crossover design. A random forest classifier was trained from the offline session and tested online with visual and proprioceptive feedback, respectively. Post-hoc classification was conducted to assess the impact of feedback modalities and learning effect (an improvement over time) on the simulated trial-based performance. Finally, we performed feature analysis to investigate the discriminant power and brain pattern modulations across the subjects. (i) For real-time classification, the average accuracy was [Formula: see text]% and [Formula: see text]% for the two online sessions. The results were significantly higher than chance level, demonstrating the feasibility to distinguish between MI of leg extension and flexion. (ii) For post-hoc classification, the performance with proprioceptive feedback ([Formula: see text]%) was significantly better than with visual feedback ([Formula: see text]%), while there was no significant learning effect. (iii) We reported individual discriminate features and brain patterns associated to each feedback modality, which exhibited differences between the two modalities although no general conclusion can be drawn. The study reported a closed-loop brain-controlled gait trainer, as a proof of concept for neurorehabilitation devices. We reported the feasibility of decoding lower-limb movement in an intuitive and natural way. As far as we know, this is the first online study discussing the role of feedback modalities in lower-limb MI decoding. Our results suggest that proprioceptive feedback has an advantage over visual feedback, which could be used to improve robot-assisted strategies for motor training and functional recovery."
28687962,"Neurofeedback training teaches individuals to modulate brain activity by providing real-time feedback and can be used for brain-computer interface control. The present study aimed to optimize training by maximizing engagement through goal-oriented task design. Participants were shown either a visual display or a robot, where each was manipulated using motor imagery (MI)-related electroencephalography signals. Those with the robot were instructed to quickly navigate grid spaces, as the potential for goal-oriented design to strengthen learning was central to our investigation. Both groups were hypothesized to show increased magnitude of these signals across 10 sessions, with the greatest gains being seen in those navigating the robot due to increased engagement. Participants demonstrated the predicted increase in magnitude, with no differentiation between hemispheres. Participants navigating the robot showed stronger left-hand MI increases than those with the computer display. This is likely due to success being reliant on maintaining strong MI-related signals. While older participants showed stronger signals in early sessions, this trend later reversed, suggesting greater natural proficiency but reduced flexibility. These results demonstrate capacity for modulating neurofeedback using MI over a series of training sessions, using tasks of varied design. Importantly, the more goal-oriented robot control task resulted in greater improvements."
28682260,"Explicit motor imagery (eMI) is a widely used brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm, but not everybody can accomplish this task. Here, we propose a BCI based on implicit motor imagery (iMI). We compared classification accuracy between eMI and iMI of hands. Fifteen able-bodied people were asked to judge the laterality of hand images presented on a computer screen in a lateral or medial orientation. This judgment task is known to require mental rotation of a person's own hands, which in turn is thought to involve iMI. The subjects were also asked to perform eMI of the hands. Their electroencephalography was recorded. Linear classifiers were designed based on common spatial patterns. For discrimination between left hand and right hand, the classifier achieved maximum of 81 ± 8% accuracy for eMI and 83 ± 3% for iMI. These results show that iMI can be used to achieve similar classification accuracy as eMI. Additional classification was performed between iMI in medial and lateral orientations of a single hand; the classifier achieved 81 ± 7% for the left hand and 78 ± 7% for the right hand, which indicate distinctive spatial patterns of cortical activity for iMI of a single hand in different directions. These results suggest that a special BCI based on iMI may be constructed, for people who cannot perform explicit imagination, for rehabilitation of movement, or for treatment of bodily spatial neglect."
28680906,"Neurofeedback is a method for using neural activity displayed on a computer to regulate one's own brain function and has been shown to be a promising technique for training individuals to interact with brain-machine interface applications such as neuroprosthetic limbs. The goal of this study was to develop a user-friendly functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based neurofeedback system to upregulate neural activity associated with motor imagery, which is frequently used in neuroprosthetic applications. We hypothesized that fNIRS neurofeedback would enhance activity in motor cortex during a motor imagery task. Twenty-two participants performed active and imaginary right-handed squeezing movements using an elastic ball while wearing a 98-channel fNIRS device. Neurofeedback traces representing localized cortical hemodynamic responses were graphically presented to participants in real time. Participants were instructed to observe this graphical representation and use the information to increase signal amplitude. Neural activity was compared during active and imaginary squeezing with and without neurofeedback. Active squeezing resulted in activity localized to the left premotor and supplementary motor cortex, and activity in the motor cortex was found to be modulated by neurofeedback. Activity in the motor cortex was also shown in the imaginary squeezing condition only in the presence of neurofeedback. These findings demonstrate that real-time fNIRS neurofeedback is a viable platform for brain-machine interface applications."
28671629,"Motor imagery is based on the volitional modulation of sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs); however, the sensorimotor processes in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are impaired, leading to degenerated motor imagery ability. Thus, motor imagery classification in ALS patients has been considered challenging in the brain-computer interface (BCI) community. In this study, we address this critical issue by introducing the Grassberger-Procaccia and Higuchi's methods to estimate the fractal dimensions (GPFD and HFD, respectively) of the electroencephalography (EEG) signals from ALS patients. Moreover, a Fisher's criterion-based channel selection strategy is proposed to automatically determine the best patient-dependent channel configuration from 30 EEG recording sites. An EEG data collection paradigm is designed to collect the EEG signal of resting state and the imagination of three movements, including right hand grasping (RH), left hand grasping (LH), and left foot stepping (LF). Five late-stage ALS patients without receiving any SMR training participated in this study. Experimental results show that the proposed GPFD feature is not only superior to the previously-used SMR features (mu and beta band powers of EEG from sensorimotor cortex) but also better than HFD. The accuracies achieved by the SMR features are not satisfactory (all lower than 80%) in all binary classification tasks, including RH imagery vs. resting, LH imagery vs. resting, and LF imagery vs. resting. For the discrimination between RH imagery and resting, the average accuracies of GPFD in 30-channel (without channel selection) and top-five-channel configurations are 95.25% and 93.50%, respectively. When using only one channel (the best channel among the 30), a high accuracy of 91.00% can still be achieved by the GPFD feature and a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The results also demonstrate that the proposed Fisher's criterion-based channel selection is capable of removing a large amount of redundant and noisy EEG channels. The proposed GPFD feature extraction combined with the channel selection strategy can be used as the basis for further developing high-accuracy and high-usability motor imagery BCI systems from which the patients with ALS can really benefit."
28665058,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) can be used to restore some communication as an alternative interface for patients suffering from locked-in syndrome. However, most BCI systems are based on SSVEP, P300, or motor imagery, and a diversity of BCI protocols would be needed for various types of patients. In this paper, we trained the choice saccade (CS) task in 2 non-human primate monkeys and recorded the brain signal using an epidural electrocorticogram (eECoG) to predict eye movement direction. We successfully predicted the direction of the upcoming eye movement using a support vector machine (SVM) with the brain signals after the directional cue onset and before the saccade execution. The mean accuracies were 80% for 2 directions and 43% for 4 directions. We also quantified the spatial-spectro-temporal contribution ratio using SVM recursive feature elimination (RFE). The channels over the frontal eye field (FEF), supplementary eye field (SEF), and superior parietal lobule (SPL) area were dominantly used for classification. The α-band in the spectral domain and the time bins just after the directional cue onset and just before the saccadic execution were mainly useful for prediction. A saccade based BCI paradigm can be projected in the 2D space, and will hopefully provide an intuitive and convenient communication platform for users."
28663052,"Motor imagery is one of the most investigated paradigms in the field of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The present study explored the feasibility of applying a common spatial pattern (CSP)-based algorithm for a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based motor imagery BCI. Ten participants performed kinesthetic imagery of their left- and right-hand movements while 20-channel fNIRS signals were recorded over the motor cortex. The CSP method was implemented to obtain the spatial filters specific for both imagery tasks. The mean, slope, and variance of the CSP filtered signals were taken as features for BCI classification. Results showed that the CSP-based algorithm outperformed two representative channel-wise methods for classifying the two imagery statuses using either data from all channels or averaged data from imagery responsive channels only (oxygenated hemoglobin: CSP-based: 75.3±13.1%; all-channel: 52.3±5.3%; averaged: 64.8±13.2%; deoxygenated hemoglobin: CSP-based: 72.3±13.0%; all-channel: 48.8±8.2%; averaged: 63.3±13.3%). Furthermore, the effectiveness of the CSP method was also observed for the motor execution data to a lesser extent. A partial correlation analysis revealed significant independent contributions from all three types of features, including the often-ignored variance feature. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the effectiveness of the CSP method for fNIRS-based motor imagery BCIs."
28660211,"A novel hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) based on the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal which consists of a motor imagery- (MI-) based online interactive brain-controlled switch, ""teeth clenching"" state detector, and a steady-state visual evoked potential- (SSVEP-) based BCI was proposed to provide multidimensional BCI control. MI-based BCI was used as single-pole double throw brain switch (SPDTBS). By combining the SPDTBS with 4-class SSEVP-based BCI, movement of robotic arm was controlled in three-dimensional (3D) space. In addition, muscle artifact (EMG) of ""teeth clenching"" condition recorded from EEG signal was detected and employed as interrupter, which can initialize the statement of SPDTBS. Real-time writing task was implemented to verify the reliability of the proposed noninvasive hybrid EEG-EMG-BCI. Eight subjects participated in this study and succeeded to manipulate a robotic arm in 3D space to write some English letters. The mean decoding accuracy of writing task was 0.93 ± 0.03. Four subjects achieved the optimal criteria of writing the word ""HI"" which is the minimum movement of robotic arm directions (15 steps). Other subjects had needed to take from 2 to 4 additional steps to finish the whole process. These results suggested that our proposed hybrid noninvasive EEG-EMG-BCI was robust and efficient for real-time multidimensional robotic arm control."
28611611,"Brain Computer Interface (BCI) speller is a typical BCI-based application to help paralyzed patients express their thoughts. This paper proposed a novel motor imagery based BCI speller with Oct-o-spell paradigm for word input. Furthermore, an intelligent input method was used for improving the performance of the BCI speller. For the English word spelling experiment, we compared synchronous control with previous asynchronous control under the same experimental condition. There were no significant differences between these two control methods in the classification accuracy, information transmission rate (ITR) or letters per minute (LPM). And the accuracy rates of over 70% validated the feasibility for these two control strategies. It was indicated that MI-based synchronous control protocol was feasible for BCI speller. And the efficiency of the predictive text entry (PTE) mode was superior to that of the Non-PTE mode."
28598972,"We present non-invasive means that detect unilateral hand motor brain activity from one individual and subsequently stimulate the somatosensory area of another individual, thus, enabling the remote hemispheric link between each brain hemisphere in humans. Healthy participants were paired as a sender and a receiver. A sender performed a motor imagery task of either right or left hand, and associated changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) mu rhythm (8-10 Hz) originating from either hemisphere were programmed to move a computer cursor to a target that appeared in either left or right of the computer screen. When the cursor reaches its target, the outcome was transmitted to another computer over the internet, and actuated the focused ultrasound (FUS) devices that selectively and non-invasively stimulated either the right or left hand somatosensory area of the receiver. Small FUS transducers effectively allowed for the independent administration of stimulatory ultrasonic waves to somatosensory areas. The stimulation elicited unilateral tactile sensation of the hand from the receiver, thus establishing the hemispheric brain-to-brain interface (BBI). Although there was a degree of variability in task accuracy, six pairs of volunteers performed the BBI task in high accuracy, transferring approximately eight commands per minute. Linkage between the hemispheric brain activities among individuals suggests the possibility for expansion of the information bandwidth in the context of BBI."
28597846,"The majority of the current approaches of connectivity based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems focus on distinguishing between different motor imagery (MI) tasks. Brain regions associated with MI are anatomically close to each other, hence these BCI systems suffer from low performances. Our objective is to introduce single-trial connectivity feature based BCI system for cognition imagery (CI) based tasks wherein the associated brain regions are located relatively far away as compared to those for MI. We implemented time-domain partial Granger causality (PGC) for the estimation of the connectivity features in a BCI setting. The proposed hypothesis has been verified with two publically available datasets involving MI and CI tasks. The results support the conclusion that connectivity based features can provide a better performance than a classical signal processing framework based on bandpass features coupled with spatial filtering for CI tasks, including word generation, subtraction, and spatial navigation. These results show for the first time that connectivity features can provide a reliable performance for imagery-based BCI system. We show that single-trial connectivity features for mixed imagery tasks (i.e. combination of CI and MI) can outperform the features obtained by current state-of-the-art method and hence can be successfully applied for BCI applications."
28572817,"We present a methodology for a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) system, with the recognition of motor imagery (MI) based on EEG and blink EOG signals. We tested the BCI system in a 3D Tetris and an analogous 2D game playing environment. To enhance player's BCI control ability, the study focused on feature extraction from EEG and control strategy supporting Game-BCI system operation. We compared the numerical differences between spatial features extracted with common spatial pattern (CSP) and the proposed multifeature extraction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D game environment at enhancing player's event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) production ability, we set the 2D Screen Game as the comparison experiment. According to a series of statistical results, the group performing MI in the 3D Tetris environment showed more significant improvements in generating MI-associated ERD/ERS. Analysis results of game-score indicated that the players' scores presented an obvious uptrend in 3D Tetris environment but did not show an obvious downward trend in 2D Screen Game. It suggested that the immersive and rich-control environment for MI would improve the associated mental imagery and enhance MI-based BCI skills."
28558741,"Certain diseases affect brain areas that control the movements of the patients' body, thereby limiting their autonomy and communication capacity. Research in the field of Brain-Computer Interfaces aims to provide patients with an alternative communication channel not based on muscular activity, but on the processing of brain signals. Through these systems, subjects can control external devices such as spellers to communicate, robotic prostheses to restore limb movements, or domotic systems. The present work focus on the non-muscular control of a robotic wheelchair. A proposal to control a wheelchair through a Brain-Computer Interface based on the discrimination of only two mental tasks is presented in this study. The wheelchair displacement is performed with discrete movements. The control signals used are sensorimotor rhythms modulated through a right-hand motor imagery task or mental idle state. The peculiarity of the control system is that it is based on a serial auditory interface that provides the user with four navigation commands. The use of two mental tasks to select commands may facilitate control and reduce error rates compared to other endogenous control systems for wheelchairs. Seventeen subjects initially participated in the study; nine of them completed the three sessions of the proposed protocol. After the first calibration session, seven subjects were discarded due to a low control of their electroencephalographic signals; nine out of ten subjects controlled a virtual wheelchair during the second session; these same nine subjects achieved a medium accuracy level above 0.83 on the real wheelchair control session. The results suggest that more extensive training with the proposed control system can be an effective and safe option that will allow the displacement of a wheelchair in a controlled environment for potential users suffering from some types of motor neuron diseases."
28553580,"Brain-computer interfaces enable users to control devices with electroencephalographic (EEG) activity from the scalp or with single-neuron activity from within the brain. One of the most challenging issues in this regard is the balance between the accuracy of brain signals from patients and the speed of interpreting them into machine language. The main objective of this paper is to analyze different approaches to achieve the balance more quickly and in a better way. To reduce the ocular artifacts, the symmetric prewhitening independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm has been evaluated, which has the lowest runtime and lowest signal-to-interference (SIR) index, without destroying the original signal. After quick elimination of all undesirable signals, two successful feature extractors - the log-band power algorithm and common spatial patterns (CSPs) - are used to extract features. The emphasis is on identifying discriminative properties of the feature sets representing EEG trials recorded during the imagination of the tongue, feet, and left-right-hand movement. Finally, three well-known classifiers are evaluated, where the ridge regression classifier and CSPs as feature extractor have the highest accuracy classification rate about 83.06% with a standard deviation of 1.22%, counterposing the recent studies."
28546809,"Motor-activity-related mental tasks are widely adopted for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) as they are a natural extension of movement intention, requiring no training to evoke brain activity. The ideal BCI aims to eliminate neuromuscular movement, making motor imagery tasks, or imagined actions with no muscle movement, good candidates. This study explores cortical activation differences between motor imagery and motor execution for both upper and lower limbs using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Four simple finger- or toe-tapping tasks (left hand, right hand, left foot, and right foot) were performed with both motor imagery and motor execution and compared to resting state. Significant activation was found during all four motor imagery tasks, indicating that they can be detected via fNIRS. Motor execution produced higher activation levels, a faster response, and a different spatial distribution compared to motor imagery, which should be taken into account when designing an imagery-based BCI. When comparing left versus right, upper limb tasks are the most clearly distinguishable, particularly during motor execution. Left and right lower limb activation patterns were found to be highly similar during both imagery and execution, indicating that higher resolution imaging, advanced signal processing, or improved subject training may be required to reliably distinguish them."
28529762,"Electroencephalography (EEG) captures electrophysiological signatures of cortical events from the scalp with high-dimensional electrode montages. Usually, excessive sources produce outliers and potentially affect the actual event related sources. Besides, EEG manifests inherent inter-subject variability of the brain dynamics, at the resting state and/or under the performance of task(s), caused probably due to the instantaneous fluctuation of psychophysiological states. A wavelet coherence (WC) analysis for optimally selecting associative inter-subject channels is proposed here and is being used to boost performances of motor imagery (MI)-based inter-subject brain computer interface (BCI). The underlying hypothesis is that optimally associative inter-subject channels can reduce the effects of outliers and, thus, eliminate dissimilar cortical patterns. The proposed approach has been tested on the dataset IVa from BCI competition III, including EEG data acquired from five healthy subjects who were given visual cues to perform 280 trials of MI for the right hand and right foot. Experimental results have shown increased classification accuracy (81.79%) using the WC-based selected 16 channels compared to the one (56.79%) achieved using all the available 118 channels. The associative channels lie mostly around the sensorimotor regions of the brain, reinforced by the previous literature, describing spatial brain dynamics during sensorimotor oscillations. Apparently, the proposed approach paves the way for optimised EEG channel selection that could boost further the efficiency and real-time performance of BCI systems."
28529473,"Many patients with locked-in syndrome (LIS) or complete locked-in syndrome (CLIS) also need brain-computer interface (BCI) platforms that do not rely on visual stimuli and are easy to use. We investigate command following and communication functions of mindBEAGLE with 9 LIS, 3 CLIS patients and three healthy controls. This tests were done with vibro-tactile stimulation with 2 or 3 stimulators (VT2 and VT3 mode) and with motor imagery (MI) paradigms. In VT2 the stimulators are fixed on the left and right wrist and the participant has the task to count the stimuli on the target hand in order to elicit a P300 response. In VT3 mode an additional stimulator is placed as a distractor on the shoulder and the participant is counting stimuli either on the right or left hand. In motor imagery mode the participant is instructed to imagine left or right hand movement. VT3 and MI also allow the participant to answer yes and no questions. Healthy controls achieved a mean assessment accuracy of 100% in VT2, 93% in VT3, and 73% in MI modes. They were able to communicate with VT3 (86.7%) and MI (83.3%) after 2 training runs. The patients achieved a mean accuracy of 76.6% in VT2, 63.1% in VT3, and 58.2% in MI modes after 1-2 training runs. 9 out of 12 LIS patients could communicate by using the vibro-tactile P300 paradigms (answered on average 8 out of 10 questions correctly) and 3 out of 12 could communicate with the motor imagery paradigm (answered correctly 4,7 out of 5 questions). 2 out of the 3 CLIS patients could use the system to communicate with VT3 (90 and 70% accuracy). The results show that paradigms based on non-visual evoked potentials and motor imagery can be effective for these users. It is also the first study that showed EEG-based BCI communication with CLIS patients and was able to bring 9 out of 12 patients to communicate with higher accuracies than reported before. More importantly this was achieved within less than 15-20 min."
28512066,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems have been suggested as a promising tool for neurorehabilitation. However, to date, there is a lack of homogeneous findings. Furthermore, no systematic reviews have analyzed the degree of validation of these interventions for upper limb (UL) motor rehabilitation poststroke. The study aims were to compile all available studies that assess an UL intervention based on an electroencephalography (EEG) BCI system in stroke; to analyze the methodological quality of the studies retrieved; and to determine the effects of these interventions on the improvement of motor abilities. TYPE: This was a systematic review. Searches were conducted in PubMed, PEDro, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial from inception to September 30, 2015. This systematic review compiles all available studies that assess UL intervention based on an EEG-BCI system in patients with stroke, analyzing their methodological quality using the Critical Review Form for Quantitative Studies, and determining the grade of recommendation of these interventions for improving motor abilities as established by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine. The articles were selected according to the following criteria: studies evaluating an EEG-based BCI intervention; studies including patients with a stroke and hemiplegia, regardless of lesion origin or temporal evolution; interventions using an EEG-based BCI to restore functional abilities of the affected UL, regardless of the interface used or its combination with other therapies; and studies using validated tools to evaluate motor function. After the literature search, 13 articles were included in this review: 4 studies were randomized controlled trials; 1 study was a controlled study; 4 studies were case series studies; and 4 studies were case reports. The methodological quality of the included papers ranged from 6 to 15, and the level of evidence varied from 1b to 5. The articles included in this review involved a total of 141 stroke patients. This systematic review suggests that BCI interventions may be a promising rehabilitation approach in subjects with stroke. II."
28472337,"Most investigators of brain-computer interface (BCI) research believe that BCI can be achieved through induced neuronal activity from the cortex, but not by evoked neuronal activity. Motor imagery (MI)-based BCI is one of the standard concepts of BCI, in that the user can generate induced activity by imagining motor movements. However, variations in performance over sessions and subjects are too severe to overcome easily; therefore, a basic understanding and investigation of BCI performance variation is necessary to find critical evidence of performance variation. Here we present not only EEG datasets for MI BCI from 52 subjects, but also the results of a psychological and physiological questionnaire, EMG datasets, the locations of 3D EEG electrodes, and EEGs for non-task-related states. We validated our EEG datasets by using the percentage of bad trials, event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) analysis, and classification analysis. After conventional rejection of bad trials, we showed contralateral ERD and ipsilateral ERS in the somatosensory area, which are well-known patterns of MI. Finally, we showed that 73.08% of datasets (38 subjects) included reasonably discriminative information. Our EEG datasets included the information necessary to determine statistical significance; they consisted of well-discriminated datasets (38 subjects) and less-discriminative datasets. These may provide researchers with opportunities to investigate human factors related to MI BCI performance variation, and may also achieve subject-to-subject transfer by using metadata, including a questionnaire, EEG coordinates, and EEGs for non-task-related states."
28466825,"The achievement of multiple instances of control with the same type of mental strategy represents a way to improve flexibility of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Here we test the hypothesis that pure visual motion imagery of an external actuator can be used as a tool to achieve three classes of electroencephalographic (EEG) based control, which might be useful in attention disorders. We hypothesize that different numbers of imagined motion alternations lead to distinctive signals, as predicted by distinct motion patterns. Accordingly, a distinct number of alternating sensory/perceptual signals would lead to distinct neural responses as previously demonstrated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We anticipate that differential modulations should also be observed in the EEG domain. EEG recordings were obtained from twelve participants using three imagery tasks: imagery of a static dot, imagery of a dot with two opposing motions in the vertical axis (two motion directions) and imagery of a dot with four opposing motions in vertical or horizontal axes (four directions). The data were analysed offline. An increase of alpha-band power was found in frontal and central channels as a result of visual motion imagery tasks when compared with static dot imagery, in contrast with the expected posterior alpha decreases found during simple visual stimulation. The successful classification and discrimination between the three imagery tasks confirmed that three different classes of control based on visual motion imagery can be achieved. The classification approach was based on a support vector machine (SVM) and on the alpha-band relative spectral power of a small group of six frontal and central channels. Patterns of alpha activity, as captured by single-trial SVM closely reflected imagery properties, in particular the number of imagined motion alternations. We found a new mental task based on visual motion imagery with potential for the implementation of multiclass (3) BCIs. Our results are consistent with the notion that frontal alpha synchronization is related with high internal processing demands, changing with the number of alternation levels during imagery. Together, these findings suggest the feasibility of pure visual motion imagery tasks as a strategy to achieve multiclass control systems with potential for BCI and in particular, neurofeedback applications in non-motor (attentional) disorders."
28420382,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a technique for brain modulation that has potential to be used in motor neurorehabilitation. Considering that the cerebellum and motor cortex exert influence on the motor network, their stimulation could enhance motor functions, such as motor imagery, and be utilized for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) during motor neurorehabilitation. A new tDCS montage that influences cerebellum and either right-hand or feet motor area is proposed and validated with a simulation of electric field. The effect of current density (0, 0.02, 0.04 or 0.06 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>) on electroencephalographic (EEG) classification into rest or right-hand/feet motor imagery was evaluated on 5 healthy volunteers for different stimulation modalities: 1) 10-minutes anodal tDCS before EEG acquisition over right-hand or 2) feet motor cortical area, and 3) 4-seconds anodal tDCS during EEG acquisition either on right-hand or feet cortical areas before each time right-hand or feet motor imagery is performed. For each subject and tDCS modality, analysis of variance and Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons tests (p <0.001) are used to detect significant differences between classification accuracies that are obtained with different current densities. For tDCS modalities that improved accuracy, t-tests (p <0.05) are used to compare μ and β band power when a specific current density is provided against the case of supplying no stimulation. The proposed montage improved the classification of right-hand motor imagery for 4 out of 5 subjects when the highest current was applied for 10 minutes over the right-hand motor area. Although EEG band power changes could not be related directly to classification improvement, tDCS appears to affect variably different motor areas on μ and/or β band. The proposed montage seems capable of enhancing right-hand motor imagery detection when the right-hand motor area is stimulated. Future research should be focused on applying higher currents over the feet motor cortex, which is deeper in the brain compared to the hand motor cortex, since it may allow observation of effects due to tDCS. Also, strategies for improving analysis of EEG respect to accuracy changes should be implemented."
28410052,"The estimation of covariance matrices is of prime importance to analyze the distribution of multivariate signals. In motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCI), covariance matrices play a central role in the extraction of features from recorded electroencephalograms (EEGs); therefore, correctly estimating covariance is crucial for EEG classification. This letter discusses algorithms to average sample covariance matrices (SCMs) for the selection of the reference matrix in tangent space mapping (TSM)-based MI-BCI. Tangent space mapping is a powerful method of feature extraction and strongly depends on the selection of a reference covariance matrix. In general, the observed signals may include outliers; therefore, taking the geometric mean of SCMs as the reference matrix may not be the best choice. In order to deal with the effects of outliers, robust estimators have to be used. In particular, we discuss and test the use of geometric medians and trimmed averages (defined on the basis of several metrics) as robust estimators. The main idea behind trimmed averages is to eliminate data that exhibit the largest distance from the average covariance calculated on the basis of all available data. The results of the experiments show that while the geometric medians show little differences from conventional methods in terms of classification accuracy in the classification of electroencephalographic recordings, the trimmed averages show significant improvement for all subjects."
28409112,"Motor recovery in severely impaired stroke patients is often very limited. To refine therapeutic interventions for regaining motor control in this patient group, the functionally relevant mechanisms of neuronal plasticity need to be detected. Cortico-muscular coherence (CMC) may provide physiological and topographic insights to achieve this goal. Synchronizing limb movements to motor-related brain activation is hypothesized to reestablish cortico-motor control indexed by CMC. In the present study, right-handed, chronic stroke patients with right-hemispheric lesions and left hand paralysis participated in a four-week training for their left upper extremity. A brain-robot interface turned event-related beta-band desynchronization of the lesioned sensorimotor cortex during kinesthetic motor-imagery into the opening of the paralyzed hand by a robotic orthosis. Simultaneous MEG/EMG recordings and individual models from MRIs were used for CMC detection and source reconstruction of cortico-muscular connectivity to the affected finger extensors before and after the training program. The upper extremity-FMA of the patients improved significantly from 16.23 ± 6.79 to 19.52 ± 7.91 (p = 0.0015). All patients showed significantly increased CMC in the beta frequency-band, with a distributed, bi-hemispheric pattern and considerable inter-individual variability. The location of CMC changes was not correlated to the severity of the motor impairment, the motor improvement or the lesion volume. Group analysis of the cortical overlap revealed a common feature in all patients following the intervention: a significantly increased level of ipsilesional premotor CMC that extended from the superior to the middle and inferior frontal gyrus, along with a confined area of increased CMC in the contralesional premotor cortex. In conclusion, functionally relevant modulations of CMC can be detected in patients with long-term, severe motor deficits after a brain-robot assisted rehabilitation training. Premotor beta-band CMC may serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target for novel treatment approaches in this patient group."
28348648,"In the context of brain-computer interface (BCI) system, the common spatial patterns (CSP) method has been used to extract discriminative spatial filters for the classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, the classification performance of CSP typically deteriorates when a few training samples are collected from a new BCI user. In this paper, we propose an approach that maintains or improves the recognition accuracy of the system with only a small size of training data set. The proposed approach is formulated by regularizing the classical CSP technique with the strategy of transfer learning. Specifically, we incorporate into the CSP analysis inter-subject information involving the same task, by minimizing the difference between the inter-subject features. Experimental results on two data sets from BCI competitions show that the proposed approach greatly improves the classification performance over that of the conventional CSP method; the transformed variant proved to be successful in almost every case, based on a small number of available training samples."
28342747,"Motor imagery involves cortical networks similar to those activated by real movements, but the extent to which the basal ganglia are recruited is not yet clear. Gamma and beta oscillations in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) vary with the effort of sustained muscle activity. We recorded local field potentials in Parkinson's disease patients and investigated if similar changes can be observed during imagined gripping at three different 'forces'. We found that beta activity decreased significantly only for imagined grips at the two stronger force levels. Additionally, gamma power significantly scaled with increasing imagined force. Thus, in combination, these two spectral features can provide information about the intended force of an imaginary grip even in the absence of sensory feedback. Modulations in the two frequency bands during imaginary movement may explain the rehabilitating benefit of motor imagery to improve motor performance. The results also suggest that STN LFPs may provide useful information for brain-machine interfaces."
28336339,"In this paper, a novel technique for determination of the optimal feature combinations and, thereby, acquisition of the maximum classification performance for a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based brain-computer interface (BCI), is proposed. After obtaining motor-imagery and rest signals from the motor cortex, filtering is applied to remove the physiological noises. Six features (signal slope, signal mean, signal variance, signal peak, signal kurtosis and signal skewness) are then extracted from the oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO). Afterwards, the hybrid genetic algorithm (GA)-support vector machine (SVM) is applied in order to determine and classify 2- and 3-feature combinations across all subjects. The SVM classifier is applied to classify motor imagery versus rest. Moreover, four time windows (0-20s, 0-10s, 11-20s and 6-15s) are selected, and the hybrid GA-SVM is applied in order to extract the optimal 2- and 3-feature combinations. In the present study, the 11-20s time window showed significantly higher classification accuracies - the minimum accuracy was 91% - than did the other time windows (p<0.05). The proposed hybrid GA-SVM technique, by selecting optimal feature combinations for an fNIRS-based BCI, shows positive classification-performance-enhancing results."
28328506,"Distinctive EEG signals from the motor and somatosensory cortex are generated during mental tasks of motor imagery (MI) and somatosensory attentional orientation (SAO). In this paper, we hypothesize that a combination of these two signal modalities provides improvements in a brain-computer interface (BCI) performance with respect to using the two methods separately, and generate novel types of multi-class BCI systems. Thirty two subjects were randomly divided into a Control-Group and a Hybrid-Group. In the Control-Group, the subjects performed left and right hand motor imagery (i.e., L-MI and R-MI). In the Hybrid-Group, the subjects performed the four mental tasks (i.e., L-MI, R-MI, L-SAO, and R-SAO). The results indicate that combining two of the tasks in a hybrid manner (such as L-SAO and R-MI) resulted in a significantly greater classification accuracy than when using two MI tasks. The hybrid modality reached 86.1% classification accuracy on average, with a 7.70% increase with respect to MI ( ), and 7.21% to SAO ( ) alone. Moreover, all 16 subjects in the hybrid modality reached at least 70% accuracy, which is considered the threshold for BCI illiteracy. In addition to the two-class results, the classification accuracy was 68.1% and 54.1% for the three-class and four-class hybrid BCI. Combining the induced brain signals from motor and somatosensory cortex, the proposed stimulus-independent hybrid BCI has shown improved performance with respect to individual modalities, reducing the portion of BCI-illiterate subjects, and provided novel types of multi-class BCIs."
28321973,"Technical advances in the field of Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) enable users to control a variety of external devices such as robotic arms, wheelchairs, virtual entities and communication systems through the decoding of brain signals in real time. Most BMI systems sample activity from restricted brain regions, typically the motor and premotor cortex, with limited spatial resolution. Despite the growing number of applications, the cortical and subcortical systems involved in BMI control are currently unknown at the whole-brain level. Here, we provide a comprehensive and detailed report of the areas active during on-line BMI control. We recorded functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while participants controlled an EEG-based BMI inside the scanner. We identified the regions activated during BMI control and how they overlap with those involved in motor imagery (without any BMI control). In addition, we investigated which regions reflect the subjective sense of controlling a BMI, the sense of agency for BMI-actions. Our data revealed an extended cortical-subcortical network involved in operating a motor-imagery BMI. This includes not only sensorimotor regions but also the posterior parietal cortex, the insula and the lateral occipital cortex. Interestingly, the basal ganglia and the anterior cingulate cortex were involved in the subjective sense of controlling the BMI. These results inform basic neuroscience by showing that the mechanisms of BMI control extend beyond sensorimotor cortices. This knowledge may be useful for the development of BMIs that offer a more natural and embodied feeling of control for the user. Hum Brain Mapp 38:2971-2989, 2017. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
28316617,"The hybrid brain computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) and P300 has been a preferred strategy aiming to improve the detection performance through combining the features of each. However, current methods used for combining these two modalities optimize them separately, which does not result in optimal performance. Here, we present an efficient framework to optimize them together by concatenating the features of MI and P300 in a block diagonal form. Then a linear classifier under a dual spectral norm regularizer is applied to the combined features. Under this framework, the hybrid features of MI and P300 can be learned, selected, and combined together directly. Experimental results on the data set of hybrid BCI based on MI and P300 are provided to illustrate competitive performance of the proposed method against other conventional methods. This provides an evidence that the method used here contributes to the discrimination performance of the brain state in hybrid BCI."
28269716,"Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is a channel of communication between the human brain and an external device through brain electrical activity. In this paper, we extracted different features to boost the classification accuracy as well as the mutual information of BCI systems. The extracted features include the magnitude of the discrete Fourier transform and the wavelet coefficients for the EEG signals in addition to distance series values and invariant moments calculated for the reconstructed phase space of the EEG measurements. Different preprocessing, feature selection, and classification schemes were utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed system for dataset III from BCI competition II. The maximum accuracy achieved was 90.7% while the maximum mutual information was 0.76 bit obtained using the distance series features."
28269589,"Generally, eye closure (EC) and eye opening (EO)-based alpha blocking has widely recognized advantages, such as being easy to use, requiring little user training, while motor imagery (MI) is difficult for some users to have concrete feelings. This study presents a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) combining MI and EC strategies - such an approach aims to overcome some disadvantages of MI-based BCI, improve the performance and universality of the BCI. The EC/EO is employed to control the machine to switch in different states including forward, stop, changing direction motions, while the MI is used to control the machine to turn left or right for 90° by imagining the hands grasp motions when the system is switched into ""changing direction"" state. Additionally, a wearable two-channel EEG device is utilized in order to increase the efficiency of EEG processing and improving the practical utility. Results show that proposed hybrid system can generate four control commands with the average accuracy of 87.72%, which is higher than only using MI. Besides, it is possible to reach the same good accuracy using two-channel EEG as with usual multi-channel EEG."
28269588,"The common spatial pattern (CSP) is extensively used to extract discriminative feature from raw Electroencephalography (EEG) signals for motor imagery classification. The CSP is a statistical signal processing technique, which relies on sample based covariance matrix estimation to give discriminative information from raw EEG signals. The sample based estimation of covariance matrix becomes a problem when the number of training samples is limited, which causes the performance of CSP based brain computer interface (BCI) to degrade significantly. In this paper, we present a maximum entropy based CSP algorithm that incorporates principle of maximum entropy while estimating the sample based covariance matrix. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on publicly available data set samples. The classification results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional CSP algorithm by 13.38% on average."
28269587,"Motor imagery, one of the first investigated neural process for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) still provides a great challenge nowadays. Aiming a better and more accurate control, multiple researches have been conducted by the scientific community. Nevertheless, there is still no robust and confident application developed. In order to augment the potential referring to motor imagery, and to attract user's interest, we propose multiple motor imagery tasks in combination with different visual or auditory stimuli. We use multi-class classification for discrimination and we observe confident classification performance for the task related to user's background."
28269262,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) provide means of communications and control, in assistive technology, which do not require motor activity from the user. The goal of this study is to promote classification of two types of imaginary movements, left and right hands, in an EMOTIV cap based system, using the Naïve Bayes classifier. A preliminary analysis with respect to results obtained by other experiments in this field is also conducted. Processing of the electroencephalography (EEG) signals is done applying Common Spatial Pattern filters. The EPOC electrodes cap is used for EEG acquisition, in two test subjects, for two distinct trial formats. The channels picked are FC5, FC6, P7 and P8 of the 10-20 system, and a discussion about the differences of using C3, C4, P3 and P4 positions is proposed. Dataset 3 of the BCI Competition II is also analyzed using the implemented algorithms. The maximum classification results for the proposed experiment and for the BCI Competition dataset were, respectively, 79% and 85% The conclusion of this study is that the picked positions for electrodes may be applied for BCI systems with satisfactory classification rates."
28268894,"In the present study a feature selection algorithm based on mutual information (MI) was applied to electro-encephalographic (EEG) data acquired during three different motor imagery tasks from two dataset: Dataset I from BCI Competition IV including full scalp recordings from four subjects, and new data recorded from three subjects using the popular low-cost Emotiv EPOC EEG headset. The aim was to evaluate optimal channels and band-power (BP) features for motor imagery tasks discrimination, in order to assess the feasibility of a portable low-cost motor imagery based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system. The minimal sub set of features most relevant to task description and less redundant to each other was determined, and the corresponding classification accuracy was assessed offline employing linear support vector machine (SVM) in a 10-fold cross validation scheme. The analysis was performed: (a) on the original full Dataset I from BCI competition IV, (b) on a restricted channels set from Dataset I corresponding to available Emotiv EPOC electrodes locations, and (c) on data recorded with the EPOC system. Results from (a) showed that an offline classification accuracy above 80% can be reached using only 5 features. Limiting the analysis to EPOC channels caused a decrease of classification accuracy, although it still remained above chance level, both for data from (b) and (c). A top accuracy of 70% was achieved using 2 optimal features. These results encourage further research towards the development of portable low cost motor imagery-based BCI systems."

We describe recoveriX and present initial results from one patient."
28268352,"Synchronization and distributed functional networks have been used with success in different areas of engineering. In this paper we use the synchronization information from electroencephalogram (EEG) channels through the Phase Locking Value (PLV) as a potential classification method for a Brain Computer Interface (BCI); this achieved using emotional schematic faces as stimuli in a motor imagery (MI) task. Based on the variations of the PLV values for each proposed task and for each participant, the principal channel pairs are identified. Selected channel pairs, corresponding with the accomplished task, present PLV patterns similarly to Evoked Potentials (ERS/ERD) which are widely used as classification features for MI based BCI."
28268317,"Improvement of classification performance is one of the key challenges in electroencephalogram (EEG) based motor imagery brain-computer interface (BCI). Recently, sparse representation based classification (SRC) method has been shown to provide satisfactory classification accuracy in motor imagery classification. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the performance of the SRC method in terms of not only its classification accuracy but also of its computation time. For this purpose, we investigate the performance of recently developed fast L1 minimization methods for their use in SRC, such as homotopy and fast iterative soft-thresholding algorithm (FISTA). From experimental analysis, we note that the SRC method with the fast L1 minimization algorithms is shown to provide robust classification performance, compared to support vector machine (SVM), both in time and accuracy."
28238175,"Pattern classification algorithm is the crucial step in developing brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. In this paper, a hierarchical support vector machine (HSVM) algorithm is proposed to address an EEG-based four-class motor imagery classification task. Wavelet packet transform is employed to decompose raw EEG signals. Thereafter, EEG signals with effective frequency sub-bands are grouped and reconstructed. EEG feature vectors are extracted from the reconstructed EEG signals with one versus the rest common spatial patterns (OVR-CSP) and one versus one common spatial patterns (OVO-CSP). Then, a two-layer HSVM algorithm is designed for the classification of these EEG feature vectors, where ""OVO"" classifiers are used in the first layer and ""OVR"" in the second layer. A public dataset (BCI Competition IV-II-a)is employed to validate the proposed method. Fivefold cross-validation results demonstrate that the average accuracy of classification in the first layer and the second layer is 67.5 ± 17.7% and 60.3 ± 14.7%, respectively. The average accuracy of the classification is 64.4 ± 16.7% overall. These results show that the proposed method is effective for four-class motor imagery classification."
28232788,"Motor imagery (MI) activates the sensorimotor system independent of actual movements and might be facilitated by neurofeedback. Knowledge on the interaction between feedback modality and the involved frequency bands during MI-related brain self-regulation is still scarce. Previous studies compared the cortical activity during the MI task with concurrent feedback (MI <i>with</i> feedback condition) to cortical activity during the relaxation task where no feedback was provided (relaxation <i>without</i> feedback condition). The observed differences might, therefore, be related to either the task or the feedback. A proper comparison would necessitate studying a relaxation condition with feedback and a MI task condition without feedback as well. Right-handed healthy subjects performed two tasks, i.e., MI and relaxation, in alternating order. Each of the tasks (MI vs. relaxation) was studied with and without feedback. The respective event-driven oscillatory activity, i.e., sensorimotor desynchronization (during MI) or synchronization (during relaxation), was rewarded with contingent feedback. Importantly, feedback onset was delayed to study the task-related cortical activity in the absence of feedback provision during the delay period. The reward modality was alternated every 15 trials between proprioceptive and visual feedback. Proprioceptive input was superior to visual input to increase the range of task-related spectral perturbations in the α- and β-band, and was necessary to consistently achieve MI-related sensorimotor desynchronization (ERD) significantly below baseline. These effects occurred in task periods without feedback as well. The increased accuracy and duration of learned brain self-regulation achieved in the proprioceptive condition was specific to the β-band. MI-related operant learning of brain self-regulation is facilitated by proprioceptive feedback and mediated in the sensorimotor β-band."
28167121,"Motor imagery (MI) is considered to be a promising cognitive tool for improving motor skills as well as for rehabilitation therapy of movement disorders. It is believed that MI training efficiency could be improved by using the brain-computer interface (BCI) technology providing real-time feedback on person's mental attempts. While BCI is indeed a convenient and motivating tool for practicing MI, it is not clear whether it could be used for predicting or measuring potential positive impact of the training. In this study, we are trying to establish whether the proficiency in BCI control is associated with any of the neurophysiological or psychological correlates of motor imagery, as well as to determine possible interrelations among them. For that purpose, we studied motor imagery in a group of 19 healthy BCI-trained volunteers and performed a correlation analysis across various quantitative assessment metrics. We examined subjects' sensorimotor event-related EEG events, corticospinal excitability changes estimated with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), BCI accuracy and self-assessment reports obtained with specially designed questionnaires and interview routine. Our results showed, expectedly, that BCI performance is dependent on the subject's capability to suppress EEG sensorimotor rhythms, which in turn is correlated with the idle state amplitude of those oscillations. Neither BCI accuracy nor the EEG features associated with MI were found to correlate with the level of corticospinal excitability increase during motor imagery, and with assessed imagery vividness. Finally, a significant correlation was found between the level of corticospinal excitability increase and kinesthetic vividness of imagery (KVIQ-20 questionnaire). Our results suggest that two distinct neurophysiological mechanisms might mediate possible effects of motor imagery: the non-specific cortical sensorimotor disinhibition and the focal corticospinal excitability increase. Acquired data suggests that BCI-based approach is unreliable in assessing motor imagery due to its high dependence on subject's innate EEG features (e.g. resting mu-rhythm amplitude). Therefore, employment of additional assessment protocols, such as TMS and psychological testing, is required for more comprehensive evaluation of the subject's motor imagery training efficiency."
28161876,"Effective feature extraction and classification methods are of great importance for motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. The common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is a widely used feature extraction method for MI-based BCIs. In this work, we propose a novel spatial-frequency-temporal optimized feature sparse representation-based classification method. Optimal channels are selected based on relative entropy criteria. Significant CSP features on frequency-temporal domains are selected automatically to generate a column vector for sparse representation-based classification (SRC). We analyzed the performance of the new method on two public EEG datasets, namely BCI competition III dataset IVa which has five subjects and BCI competition IV dataset IIb which has nine subjects. Compared to the performance offered by the existing SRC method, the proposed method achieves average classification accuracy improvements of 21.568 and 14.38% for BCI competition III dataset IVa and BCI competition IV dataset IIb, respectively. Furthermore, our approach also shows better classification performance when compared to other competing methods for both datasets."
28145274,"Movement control is an important application for EEG-BCI (EEG-based brain-computer interface) systems. A single-modality BCI cannot provide an efficient and natural control strategy, but a hybrid BCI system that combines two or more different tasks can effectively overcome the drawbacks encountered in single-modality BCI control. In the current paper, we developed a new hybrid BCI system by combining MI (motor imagery) and mVEP (motion-onset visual evoked potential), aiming to realize the more efficient 2D movement control of a cursor. The offline analysis demonstrates that the hybrid BCI system proposed in this paper could evoke the desired MI and mVEP signal features simultaneously, and both are very close to those evoked in the single-modality BCI task. Furthermore, the online 2D movement control experiment reveals that the proposed hybrid BCI system could provide more efficient and natural control commands. The proposed hybrid BCI system is compensative to realize efficient 2D movement control for a practical online system, especially for those situations in which P300 stimuli are not suitable to be applied."
29717597,"In the research of non-invasive brain-computer interface(BCI), independent component analysis(ICA) has been considered as a promising method of electroencephalogram(EEG) preprocessing and feature enhancement. However, there have been few investigations and implements about online ICA-BCI system up till now.This paper reports the investigation of the ICA-based motor imagery BCI(MIBCI) system, combining the characteristics of unsupervised learning of ICA and event-related desynchronization(ERD) related to motor imagery. We constructed a simple and practical method of ICA spatial filter calculation and discriminate criterion of three-type motor imageries in the study. To validate the online performance of proposed algorithms, an ICA-MIBCI experimental system was fully established based on Neuro Scan EEG amplifier and VC++ platform. Four subjects participated in the experiment of MIBCI testing and two of them took part in the online experiment. The average classification accuracies of the three-type motor imageries reached 89.78% and 89.89% in the offline and online testing, respectively. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm produced high classification accuracy and required less time consumption, which would have a prospect of cross platform application."
28124985,"Electroencephalography is a non-invasive measure of the brain electrical activity generated by millions of neurons. Feature extraction in electroencephalography analysis is a core issue that may lead to accurate brain mental state classification. This paper presents a new feature selection method that improves left/right hand movement identification of a motor imagery brain-computer interface, based on genetic algorithms and artificial neural networks used as classifiers. Raw electroencephalography signals are first preprocessed using appropriate filtering. Feature extraction is carried out afterwards, based on spectral and temporal signal components, and thus a feature vector is constructed. As various features might be inaccurate and mislead the classifier, thus degrading the overall system performance, the proposed approach identifies a subset of features from a large feature space, such that the classifier error rate is reduced. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to reduce the number of features to as low as 0.5% (i.e., the number of ignored features can reach 99.5%) while improving the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision of the classifier."
28119594,"Motor imagery (MI) and action observation have proven to be efficacious adjuncts to traditional physiotherapy for enhancing motor recovery following stroke. Recently, researchers have used a combined approach called imagined imitation (II), where an individual watches a motor task being performed, while simultaneously imagining they are performing the movement. While neurofeedback (NFB) has been used extensively with MI to improve patients' ability to modulate sensorimotor activity and enhance motor recovery, the effectiveness of using NFB with II to modulate brain activity is unknown. This project tested the ability of participants to modulate sensorimotor activity during electroencephalography-based II-NFB of a complex, multi-part unilateral handshake, and whether this ability transferred to a subsequent bout of MI. Moreover, given the goal of translating findings from NFB research into practical applications, such as rehabilitation, the II-NFB system was designed with several user interface and user experience features, in an attempt to both drive user engagement and match the level of challenge to the abilities of the subjects. In particular, at easy difficulty levels the II-NFB system incentivized contralateral sensorimotor up-regulation (via event related desynchronization of the mu rhythm), while at higher difficulty levels the II-NFB system incentivized sensorimotor lateralization (i.e., both contralateral up-regulation and ipsilateral down-regulation). Thirty-two subjects, receiving real or sham NFB attended four sessions where they engaged in II-NFB training and subsequent MI. Results showed the NFB group demonstrated more bilateral sensorimotor activity during sessions 2-4 during II-NFB and subsequent MI, indicating mixed success for the implementation of this particular II-NFB system. Here we discuss our findings in the context of the design features included in the II-NFB system, highlighting limitations that should be considered in future designs."
28113943,"We provide an open access dataset for hybrid brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) using electroencephalography (EEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). For this, we con-ducted two BCI experiments (left vs. right hand motor imagery; mental arithmetic vs. resting state). The dataset was validated using baseline signal analysis methods, with which classification performance was evaluated for each modality and a combination of both modalities. As already shown in previous literature, the capability of discriminating different mental states can be en-hanced by using a hybrid approach, when comparing to single modality analyses. This makes the provided data highly suitable for hybrid BCI investigations. Since our open access dataset also comprises motion artifacts and physiological data, we expect that it can be used in a wide range of future validation approaches in multimodal BCI research."
28113345,"motor imagery (MI) is a mental representation of motor behavior. The MI-based brain computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide communication for the physically impaired. The performance of MI-based BCI mainly depends on the subject's ability to self-modulate electroencephalogram signals. Proper training can help naive subjects learn to modulate brain activity proficiently. However, training subjects typically involve abstract motor tasks and are time-consuming. to improve the performance of naive subjects during motor imagery, a novel paradigm was presented that would guide naive subjects to modulate brain activity effectively. In this new paradigm, pictures of the left or right hand were used as cues for subjects to finish the motor imagery task. Fourteen healthy subjects (11 male, aged 22-25 years, and mean 23.6±1.16) participated in this study. The task was to imagine writing a Chinese character. Specifically, subjects could imagine hand movements corresponding to the sequence of writing strokes in the Chinese character. This paradigm was meant to find an effective and familiar action for most Chinese people, to provide them with a specific, extensively practiced task and help them modulate brain activity. results showed that the writing task paradigm yielded significantly better performance than the traditional arrow paradigm (p < 0.001). Questionnaire replies indicated that most subjects thought that the new paradigm was easier. the proposed new motor imagery paradigm could guide subjects to help them modulate brain activity effectively. Results showed that there were significant improvements using new paradigm, both in classification accuracy and usability."
28096809,"The common spatial pattern (CSP) and other spatiospectral feature extraction methods have become the most effective and successful approaches to solve the problem of motor imagery electroencephalography (MI-EEG) pattern recognition from multichannel neural activity in recent years. However, these methods need a lot of preprocessing and postprocessing such as filtering, demean, and spatiospectral feature fusion, which influence the classification accuracy easily. In this paper, we utilize linear dynamical systems (LDSs) for EEG signals feature extraction and classification. LDSs model has lots of advantages such as simultaneous spatial and temporal feature matrix generation, free of preprocessing or postprocessing, and low cost. Furthermore, a low-rank matrix decomposition approach is introduced to get rid of noise and resting state component in order to improve the robustness of the system. Then, we propose a low-rank LDSs algorithm to decompose feature subspace of LDSs on finite Grassmannian and obtain a better performance. Extensive experiments are carried out on public dataset from ""BCI Competition III Dataset IVa"" and ""BCI Competition IV Database 2a."" The results show that our proposed three methods yield higher accuracies compared with prevailing approaches such as CSP and CSSP."
28091395,"Self-paced EEG-based BCIs (SP-BCIs) have traditionally been avoided due to two sources of uncertainty: (1) precisely when an intentional command is sent by the brain, i.e., the command onset detection problem, and (2) how different the intentional command is when compared to non-specific (or idle) states. Performance evaluation is also a problem and there are no suitable standard metrics available. In this paper we attempted to tackle these issues. Self-paced covert sound-production cognitive tasks (i.e., high pitch and siren-like sounds) were used to distinguish between intentional commands (IC) and idle states. The IC states were chosen for their ease of execution and negligible overlap with common cognitive states. Band power and a digital wavelet transform were used for feature extraction, and the Davies-Bouldin index was used for feature selection. Classification was performed using linear discriminant analysis. Performance was evaluated under offline and simulated-online conditions. For the latter, a performance score called true-false-positive (TFP) rate, ranging from 0 (poor) to 100 (perfect), was created to take into account both classification performance and onset timing errors. Averaging the results from the best performing IC task for all seven participants, an 77.7% true-positive (TP) rate was achieved in offline testing. For simulated-online analysis the best IC average TFP score was 76.67% (87.61% TP rate, 4.05% false-positive rate). Results were promising when compared to previous IC onset detection studies using motor imagery, in which best TP rates were reported as 72.0% and 79.7%, and which, crucially, did not take timing errors into account. Moreover, based on our literature review, there is no previous covert sound-production onset detection system for spBCIs. Results showed that the proposed onset detection technique and TFP performance metric have good potential for use in SP-BCIs."
28055887,"Advances in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology have facilitated the detection of Motor Imagery (MI) from electroencephalography (EEG). First, we present three strategies of using BCI to detect MI from EEG: operant conditioning that employed a fixed model, machine learning that employed a subject-specific model computed from calibration, and adaptive strategy that continuously compute the subject-specific model. Second, we review prevailing works that employed the operant conditioning and machine learning strategies. Third, we present our past work on six stroke patients who underwent a BCI rehabilitation clinical trial with averaged accuracies of 79.8% during calibration and 69.5% across 18 online feedback sessions. Finally, we perform an offline study in this paper on our work employing the adaptive strategy. The results yielded significant improvements of 12% (p < 0.001) and 9% (p < 0.001) using all the data and using limited preceding data respectively in the feedback accuracies. The results showed an increase in the amount of training data yielded improvements. Nevertheless, results of using limited preceding data showed a larger part of the improvement was due to the adaptive strategy and changing subject-specific models did not deteriorate the accuracies. Hence the adaptive strategy is effective in addressing the non-stationarity between calibration and feedback sessions."
28055886,"Performance variation is one of the main challenges that BCIs are confronted with, when being used over extended periods of time. Shared control techniques could partially cope with such a problem. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy of shared control approaches used for BCIs and we review some of the recent studies at the light of these approaches. We posit that the level of assistance provided to the BCI user should be adjusted in real time in order to enhance BCI reliability over time. This approach has not been extensively studied in the recent literature on BCIs. In addition, we investigate the effectiveness of providing online adaptive assistance in a motor-imagery BCI for a tetraplegic end-user with an incomplete locked-in syndrome in a longitudinal study lasting 11 months. First, we report a reliable estimation of the BCI performance (in terms of command delivery time) using only a window of 1 s in the beginning of trials (AUC ≈ 0.8 ). Second, we demonstrate how adaptive shared control can exploit the output of the performance estimator to adjust online the level of assistance in a BCI game by regulating its speed. In particular, online adaptive assistance was superior to a fixed condition in terms of success rate ( ). Remarkably, the results exhibited a stable performance over severalmonths without recalibration of the BCI classifier or the performance estimator."
28012854,"Common spatial pattern (CSP) is most widely used in motor imagery based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. In conventional CSP algorithm, pairs of the eigenvectors corresponding to both extreme eigenvalues are selected to construct the optimal spatial filter. In addition, an appropriate selection of subject-specific time segments and frequency bands plays an important role in its successful application. This study proposes to optimize spatial-frequency-temporal patterns for discriminative feature extraction. Spatial optimization is implemented by channel selection and finding discriminative spatial filters adaptively on each time-frequency segment. A novel Discernibility of Feature Sets (DFS) criteria is designed for spatial filter optimization. Besides, discriminative features located in multiple time-frequency segments are selected automatically by the proposed sparse time-frequency segment common spatial pattern (STFSCSP) method which exploits sparse regression for significant features selection. Finally, a weight determined by the sparse coefficient is assigned for each selected CSP feature and we propose a Weighted Naïve Bayesian Classifier (WNBC) for classification. Experimental results on two public EEG datasets demonstrate that optimizing spatial-frequency-temporal patterns in a data-driven manner for discriminative feature extraction greatly improves the classification performance. The proposed method gives significantly better classification accuracies in comparison with several competing methods in the literature. The proposed approach is a promising candidate for future BCI systems."

In addition, the brain oscillatory pattern in the hybrid task was also investigated. 64-channel electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded during MI, selective attention (SA) and hybrid tasks in fourteen healthy subjects. In the hybrid task, subjects performed MI with electrical stimulation which was applied to bilateral median nerve on wrists simultaneously. The hybrid task clearly presented additional steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (SSSEP) induced by electrical stimulation with MI-induced event-related desynchronization (ERD). By combining ERD and SSSEP features, the performance in the hybrid task was significantly better than in both MI and SA tasks, achieving a ~14% improvement in total relative to the MI task alone and reaching ~89% in mean classification accuracy. On the contrary, there was no significant enhancement obtained in performance while separate ERD feature was utilized in the hybrid task. In terms of the hybrid task, the performance using combined feature was significantly better than using separate ERD or SSSEP feature. The results in this work validate the feasibility of our proposed approach to form a novel MI-SSSEP hybrid BCI outperforming a conventional MI-based BCI through combing MI with electrical stimulation."
27992574,"Motor imagery (MI) with real-time neurofeedback could be a viable approach, e.g., in rehabilitation of cerebral stroke. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) noninvasively measures electric brain activity at high temporal resolution and is well-suited for recording oscillatory brain signals. MI is known to modulate 10- and 20-Hz oscillations in the somatomotor system. In order to provide accurate feedback to the subject, the most relevant MI-related features should be extracted from MEG data. In this study, we evaluated several MEG signal features for discriminating between left- and right-hand MI and between MI and rest. MEG was measured from nine healthy participants imagining either left- or right-hand finger tapping according to visual cues. Data preprocessing, feature extraction and classification were performed offline. The evaluated MI-related features were power spectral density (PSD), Morlet wavelets, short-time Fourier transform (STFT), common spatial patterns (CSP), filter-bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP), spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD), and combined SSD+CSP, CSP+PSD, CSP+Morlet, and CSP+STFT. We also compared four classifiers applied to single trials using 5-fold cross-validation for evaluating the classification accuracy and its possible dependence on the classification algorithm. In addition, we estimated the inter-session left-vs-right accuracy for each subject. The SSD+CSP combination yielded the best accuracy in both left-vs-right (mean 73.7%) and MI-vs-rest (mean 81.3%) classification. CSP+Morlet yielded the best mean accuracy in inter-session left-vs-right classification (mean 69.1%). There were large inter-subject differences in classification accuracy, and the level of the 20-Hz suppression correlated significantly with the subjective MI-vs-rest accuracy. Selection of the classification algorithm had only a minor effect on the results. We obtained good accuracy in sensor-level decoding of MI from single-trial MEG data. Feature extraction methods utilizing both the spatial and spectral profile of MI-related signals provided the best classification results, suggesting good performance of these methods in an online MEG neurofeedback system."
27990240,"Conventional therapies do not provide paralyzed patients with closed-loop sensorimotor integration for motor rehabilitation. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) uses brain-computer interface (BCI) technology to monitor patients' movement imagery in real-time, and utilizes the information to control functional electrical stimulation (FES) and bar feedback for complete sensorimotor closed loop. To realize this approach, we introduce the recoveriX system, a hardware and software platform for PAS. After 10 sessions of recoveriX training, one stroke patient partially regained control of dorsiflexion in her paretic wrist. A controlled group study is planned with a new version of the recoveriX system, which will use a new FES system and an avatar instead of bar feedback."
27965067,"Unlike in healthy controls, sensorimotor β-desynchronization (β-ERD) is compromised in stroke patients, i.e., the more severe the patient's motor impairment, the less β-ERD. This, in turn, provides a target substrate for therapeutic brain self-regulation and neurofeedback. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been shown to modulate brain oscillations during and after stimulation, and may thus facilitate brain self-regulation during neurofeedback interventions. Twenty severely impaired, chronic stroke patients performed kinesthetic motor-imagery while a brain-robot interface transformed β-ERD (17-23 Hz) of the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex into opening of the paralyzed hand by a robotic orthosis. In a parallel group design, β-tACS (20 Hz, 1.1 mA peak-to-peak amplitude) was applied to the lesioned motor cortex either continuously (c-tACS) before or intermittently (i-tACS) during the intervention. Physiological effects of β-tACS were studied using electroencephalography. The patients' ability for brain self-regulation was captured by neurofeedback performance metrics. i-tACS - but not c-tACS - improved the classification accuracy of the neurofeedback intervention in comparison to baseline. This effect was mediated via the increased specificity of the classification, i.e., reduced variance of resting oscillations. Neither i-tACS nor c-tACS had aftereffects following the stimulation period. β-tACS may constitute an adjunct neuromodulation technique during neurofeedback-based interventions for stroke rehabilitation."
27918413,"To recognize the user's motion intention, brain-machine interfaces (BMI) usually decode movements from cortical activity to control exoskeletons and neuroprostheses for daily activities. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether self-induced variations of the electroencephalogram (EEG) can be useful as control signals for an upper-limb exoskeleton developed by us. A BMI based on event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) is proposed. In the decoder-training phase, we investigate the offline classification performance of left versus right hand and left hand versus both feet by using motor execution (ME) or motor imagery (MI). The results indicate that the accuracies of ME sessions are higher than those of MI sessions, and left hand versus both feet paradigm achieves a better classification performance, which would be used in the online-control phase. In the online-control phase, the trained decoder is tested in two scenarios (wearing or without wearing the exoskeleton). The MI and ME sessions wearing the exoskeleton achieve mean classification accuracy of 84.29% ± 2.11% and 87.37% ± 3.06%, respectively. The present study demonstrates that the proposed BMI is effective to control the upper-limb exoskeleton, and provides a practical method by non-invasive EEG signal associated with human natural behavior for clinical applications."
27900952,"Signal classification is an important issue in brain computer interface (BCI) systems. Deep learning approaches have been used successfully in many recent studies to learn features and classify different types of data. However, the number of studies that employ these approaches on BCI applications is very limited. In this study we aim to use deep learning methods to improve classification performance of EEG motor imagery signals. In this study we investigate convolutional neural networks (CNN) and stacked autoencoders (SAE) to classify EEG Motor Imagery signals. A new form of input is introduced to combine time, frequency and location information extracted from EEG signal and it is used in CNN having one 1D convolutional and one max-pooling layers. We also proposed a new deep network by combining CNN and SAE. In this network, the features that are extracted in CNN are classified through the deep network SAE. The classification performance obtained by the proposed method on BCI competition IV dataset 2b in terms of kappa value is 0.547. Our approach yields 9% improvement over the winner algorithm of the competition. Our results show that deep learning methods provide better classification performance compared to other state of art approaches. These methods can be applied successfully to BCI systems where the amount of data is large due to daily recording."
27849545,"We provide an open access dataset for hybrid brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) using electroencephalography (EEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). For this, we con-ducted two BCI experiments (left vs. right hand motor imagery; mental arithmetic vs. resting state). The dataset was validated using baseline signal analysis methods, with which classification performance was evaluated for each modality and a combination of both modalities. As already shown in previous literature, the capability of discriminating different mental states can be en-hanced by using a hybrid approach, when comparing to single modality analyses. This makes the provided data highly suitable for hybrid BCI investigations. Since our open access dataset also comprises motion artifacts and physiological data, we expect that it can be used in a wide range of future validation approaches in multimodal BCI research."
27845668,"Passiveand imagined limbmovements induce changes in cerebral oscillatory activity. Central modulatory effects play a role in plastic changes, and are of uttermost importance in rehabilitation. This has extensively been studied for upper limb, but less is known for lower limb. The aim of this study is to investigate the topographical distribution of event-related desynchronization/synchronization(ERD/ERS) and task-relatedcoherence during a robot-assisted and a motor imagery task of lower limb in healthy subjects to inform rehabilitation paradigms. 32-channels electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in twenty-one healthy right footed and handed subjects during a robot-assisted single-joint cyclic right ankle movement performed by the BTS ANYMOV robotic hospital bed. Data were acquired with a block protocol for passive and imagined movement at a frequency of 0.2 Hz. ERD/ERS and task related coherence were calculated in alpha1 (8-10 Hz), alpha2 (10.5-12.5 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) frequency ranges. During passive movement, alpha2 rhythm desynchronized overC3 and ipsilateral frontal areas (F4, FC2, FC6); betaERD was detected over the bilateral motor areas (Cz, C3, C4). During motor imagery, a significant desynchronization was evident for alpha1 over contralateral sensorimotor cortex (C3), for alpha2 over bilateral motor areas (C3 and C4), and for beta over central scalp areas. Task-related coherence decreased during passive movement in alpha2 band between contralateral central area (C3, CP5, CP1, P3) and ipsilateral frontal area (F8, FC6, T8); beta band coherence decreased between C3-C4 electrodes, and increased between C3-Cz. These data contribute to the understanding of oscillatory activity and functional neuronal interactions during lower limb robot-assisted motor performance. The final output of this line of research is to inform the design and development of neurorehabilitation protocols."
27845150,"Motion-onset visual evoked potentials (mVEP) can provide a softer stimulus with reduced fatigue, and it has potential applications for brain computer interface(BCI)systems. However, the mVEP waveform is seriously masked in the strong background EEG activities, and an effective approach is needed to extract the corresponding mVEP features to perform task recognition for BCI control. In the current study, we combine deep learning with compressed sensing to mine discriminative mVEP information to improve the mVEP BCI performance. The deep learning and compressed sensing approach can generate the multi-modality features which can effectively improve the BCI performance with approximately 3.5% accuracy incensement over all 11 subjects and is more effective for those subjects with relatively poor performance when using the conventional features. Compared with the conventional amplitude-based mVEP feature extraction approach, the deep learning and compressed sensing approach has a higher classification accuracy and is more effective for subjects with relatively poor performance. According to the results, the deep learning and compressed sensing approach is more effective for extracting the mVEP feature to construct the corresponding BCI system, and the proposed feature extraction framework is easy to extend to other types of BCIs, such as motor imagery (MI), steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)and P300."
27818001,"Stroke frequently results in motor impairment. Motor imagery (MI), the mental practice of movements, has been suggested as a promising complement to other therapeutic approaches facilitating motor rehabilitation. Of particular potential is the combination of MI with neurofeedback (NF). However, MI NF protocols have been largely optimized only in younger healthy adults, although strokes occur more frequently in older adults. The present study examined the influence of age on the neural correlates of MI supported by electroencephalogram (EEG)-based NF and on the neural correlates of motor execution. We adopted a multimodal neuroimaging framework focusing on EEG-derived event-related desynchronization (ERD%) and oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR) concentrations simultaneously acquired using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). ERD%, HbO concentration and HbR concentration were compared between younger (mean age: 24.4 years) and older healthy adults (mean age: 62.6 years). During MI, ERD% and HbR concentration were less lateralized in older adults than in younger adults. The lateralization-by-age interaction was not significant for movement execution. Moreover, EEG-based NF was related to an increase in task-specific activity when compared to the absence of feedback in both older and younger adults. Finally, significant modulation correlations were found between ERD% and hemodynamic measures despite the absence of significant amplitude correlations. Overall, the findings suggest a complex relationship between age and movement-related activity in electrophysiological and hemodynamic measures. Our results emphasize that the age of the actual end-user should be taken into account when designing neurorehabilitation protocols."
27816779,"When presented with a difficult perceptual decision, human observers are able to make metacognitive judgements of subjective certainty. Such judgements can be made independently of and prior to any overt response to a sensory stimulus, presumably via internal monitoring. Retrospective judgements about one's own task performance, on the other hand, require first that the subject perform a task and thus could potentially be made based on motor processes, proprioceptive, and other sensory feedback rather than internal monitoring. With this dichotomy in mind, we set out to study performance monitoring using a brain-computer interface (BCI), with which subjects could voluntarily perform an action - moving a cursor on a computer screen - without any movement of the body, and thus without somatosensory feedback. Real-time visual feedback was available to subjects during training, but not during the experiment where the true final position of the cursor was only revealed after the subject had estimated where s/he thought it had ended up after 6s of BCI-based cursor control. During the first half of the experiment subjects based their assessments primarily on the prior probability of the end position of the cursor on previous trials. However, during the second half of the experiment subjects' judgements moved significantly closer to the true end position of the cursor, and away from the prior. This suggests that subjects can monitor task performance when the task is performed without overt movement of the body."
27425203,"Assistive technologies help patients to reacquire interacting capabilities with the environment and improve their quality of life. In this manuscript we present a feasibility study in which healthy users were able to use a non-invasive Motor Imagery (MI)-based brain computer interface (BCI) to achieve linear control of an upper-limb functional electrical stimulation (FES) controlled neuro-prosthesis. The linear control allowed the real-time computation of a continuous control signal that was used by the FES system to physically set the stimulation parameters to control the upper-limb position. Even if the nature of the task makes the operation very challenging, the participants achieved a mean selection accuracy of 82.5% in a target selection experiment. An analysis of limb kinematics as well as the positioning precision was performed, showing the viability of using a BCI-FES system to control upper-limb reaching movements. The results of this study constitute an accurate use of an online non-invasive BCI to operate a FES-neuroprosthesis setting a step toward the recovery of the control of an impaired limb with the sole use of brain activity."
27762234,"Rehabilitation applications using brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have recently shown encouraging results for motor recovery. Effective BCI neurorehabilitation has been shown to exploit neuroplastic properties of the brain through mental imagery tasks. However, these applications and results are currently restricted to adults. A systematic search reveals there is essentially no literature describing motor rehabilitative BCI applications that use electroencephalograms (EEG) in children, despite advances in such applications with adults. Further inspection highlights limited literature pursuing research in the field, especially outside of neurofeedback paradigms. Then the question naturally arises, do current literature trends indicate that EEG based BCI motor rehabilitation applications could be translated to children? To provide further evidence beyond the available literature for this particular topic, we present an exploratory survey examining some of the indirect literature related to motor rehabilitation BCI in children. Our goal is to establish if evidence in the related literature supports research on this topic and if the related studies can help explain the dearth of current research in this area. The investigation found positive literature trends in the indirect studies which support translating these BCI applications to children and provide insight into potential pitfalls perhaps responsible for the limited literature. Careful consideration of these pitfalls in conjunction with support from the literature emphasize that fully realized motor rehabilitation BCI applications for children are feasible and would be beneficial. •  BCI intervention has improved motor recovery in adult patients and offer supplementary rehabilitation options to patients. •  A systematic literature search revealed that essentially no research has been conducted bringing motor rehabilitation BCI applications to children, despite advances in BCI. •  Indirect studies discovered from the systematic literature search, i.e. neurorehabilitation in children via BCI for autism spectrum disorder, provide insight into translating motor rehabilitation BCI applications to children. •  Translating BCI applications to children is a relevant, important area of research which is relatively barren."
26906278,"Neurofeedback training (NFT) has shown to be promising and useful to rehabilitate cognitive functions. Recently, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) were used to restore brain plasticity by inducing brain activity with an NFT. In our study, we hypothesized that an NFT with a motor imagery-based BCI (MI-BCI) could enhance cognitive functions related to aging effects. To assess the effectiveness of our MI-BCI application, 63 subjects (older than 60 years) were recruited. This novel application was used by 31 subjects (NFT group). Their Luria neuropsychological test scores were compared with the remaining 32 subjects, who did not perform NFT (control group). Electroencephalogram changes measured by relative power (RP) endorsed cognitive potential findings under study: visuospatial, oral language, memory, intellectual and attention functions. Three frequency bands were selected to assess cognitive changes: 12, 18, and 21 Hz (bandwidth 3 Hz). Significant increases (p < 0.01) in the RP of these frequency bands were found. Moreover, results from cognitive tests showed significant improvements (p < 0.01) in four cognitive functions after performing five NFT sessions: visuospatial, oral language, memory, and intellectual. This established evidence in the association between NFT performed by a MI-BCI and enhanced cognitive performance. Therefore, it could be a novel approach to help elderly people."
27695410,"Early neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies suggested that motor imagery recruited a different network than motor execution. However, several studies have provided evidence for the involvement of the same circuits in motor imagery tasks, in the absence of overt responses. The present study aimed to test whether imagined performance of a stop-signal task produces a similar pattern of motor-related EEG activity than that observed during real performance. To this end, mu and beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) and the Lateralized Readiness Potential (LRP) were analyzed. The study also aimed to clarify the functional significance of the Stop-N2 and Stop-P3 event-related potential (ERPs) components, which were also obtained during both real and imagined performance. The results showed a common pattern of brain electrical activity, and with a similar time course, during covert performance and overt execution of the stop-signal task: presence of LRP and Stop-P3 in the imagined condition and identical LRP onset, and similar mu and beta ERD temporal windows for both conditions. These findings suggest that a similar inhibitory network may be activated during both overt and covert execution of the task. Therefore, motor imagery may be useful to improve inhibitory skills and to develop new communicating systems for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) devices based on inhibitory signals."
29714933,"Most of electroencephalogram(EEG)acquired by multi-channels is difficult to be applied to the singlechannel brain-computer interface(BCI)in the EEG analysis method based on left and right hand motor imagery.The present research applied an improved independent component analysis(ICA)method to realize pretreatment of the EEG effectively.Firstly,data drift was removed through linear drift correction.Secondly,the number of virtual channels were increased by applying delayed window data and some EEG artifacts which are namely electrooculogram(EOG)and electrocardiogram(ECG)were removed by ICA.Finally,the average instantaneous energy characteristics were calculated and classified through the instantaneous amplitude which was solved by applying Hilbert-Huang transform(HHT).The experiment proves that the method completes the EEG pretreatment and improves classification ratio of single-channel EEG,and lays a foundation of single-channel and portable BCI."
27681162,"Common spatial pattern (CSP) is a powerful algorithm for extracting discriminative brain patterns in motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, its performance depends largely on the subject-specific frequency band and time segment. Accurate selection of most responsive frequency band and time segment remains a crucial problem. A novel evolutionary algorithm, the backtracking search optimization algorithm is used to find the optimal frequency band and the optimal combination of frequency band and time segment. The former is searched by a frequency window with changing width of which starting and ending points are selected by the backtracking optimization algorithm; the latter is searched by the same frequency window and an additional time window with fixed width. The three parameters, the starting and ending points of frequency window and the starting point of time window, are jointly optimized by the backtracking search optimization algorithm. Based on the chosen frequency band and fixed or chosen time segment, the same feature extraction is conducted by CSP and subsequent classification is carried out by Fisher discriminant analysis. The classification error rate is used as the objective function of the backtracking search optimization algorithm. The two methods, named BSA-F CSP and BSA-FT CSP, were evaluated on data set of BCI competition and compared with traditional wideband (8-30[Formula: see text]Hz) CSP. The classification results showed that backtracking search optimization algorithm can find much effective frequency band for EEG preprocessing compared to traditional broadband, substantially enhancing CSP performance in terms of classification accuracy. On the other hand, the backtracking search optimization algorithm for joint selection of frequency band and time segment can find their optimal combination, and thus can further improve classification rates."
27654174,"Body ownership illusions provide evidence that our sense of self is not coherent and can be extended to non-body objects. Studying about these illusions gives us practical tools to understand the brain mechanisms that underlie body recognition and the experience of self. We previously introduced an illusion of body ownership transfer (BOT) for operators of a very humanlike robot. This sensation of owning the robot's body was confirmed when operators controlled the robot either by performing the desired motion with their body (motion-control) or by employing a brain-computer interface (BCI) that translated motor imagery commands to robot movement (BCI-control). The interesting observation during BCI-control was that the illusion could be induced even with a noticeable delay in the BCI system. Temporal discrepancy has always shown critical weakening effects on body ownership illusions. However the delay-robustness of BOT during BCI-control raised a question about the interaction between the proprioceptive inputs and delayed visual feedback in agency-driven illusions. In this work, we compared the intensity of BOT illusion for operators in two conditions; motion-control and BCI-control. Our results revealed a significantly stronger BOT illusion for the case of BCI-control. This finding highlights BCI's potential in inducing stronger agency-driven illusions by building a direct communication between the brain and controlled body, and therefore removing awareness from the subject's own body."
27636359,"Electroencephalographic (EEG) event-related desynchronization (ERD) induced by movement imagery or by observing biological movements performed by someone else has recently been used extensively for brain-computer interface-based applications, such as applications used in stroke rehabilitation training and motor skill learning. However, the ERD responses induced by the movement imagery and observation might not be as reliable as the ERD responses induced by movement execution. Given that studies on the reliability of the EEG ERD responses induced by these activities are still lacking, here we conducted an EEG experiment with movement imagery, movement observation, and movement execution, performed multiple times each in a pseudorandomized order in the same experimental runs. Then, independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to the EEG data to find the common motor-related EEG source activity shared by the three motor tasks. Finally, conditional EEG ERD responses associated with the three movement conditions were computed and compared. Among the three motor conditions, the EEG ERD responses induced by motor execution revealed the alpha power suppression with highest strengths and longest durations. The ERD responses of the movement imagery and movement observation only partially resembled the ERD pattern of the movement execution condition, with slightly better detectability for the ERD responses associated with the movement imagery and faster ERD responses for movement observation. This may indicate different levels of involvement in the same motor-related brain circuits during different movement conditions. In addition, because the resulting conditional EEG ERD responses from the ICA preprocessing came with minimal contamination from the non-related and/or artifactual noisy components, this result can play a role of the reference for devising a brain-computer interface using the EEG ERD features of movement imagery or observation.

27635129,"Motor imagery is a common control strategy in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, voluntary control of sensorimotor (SMR) rhythms by imagining a movement can be skilful and unintuitive and usually requires a varying amount of user training. To boost the training process, a whole class of BCI systems have been proposed, providing feedback as early as possible while continuously adapting the underlying classifier model. The present work describes a cue-paced, EEG-based BCI system using motor imagery that falls within the category of the previously mentioned ones. Specifically, our adaptive strategy includes a simple scheme based on a common spatial pattern (CSP) method and support vector machine (SVM) classification. The system's efficacy was proved by online testing on 10 healthy participants. In addition, we suggest some features we implemented to improve a system's ""flexibility"" and ""customizability,"" namely, (i) a flexible training session, (ii) an unbalancing in the training conditions, and (iii) the use of adaptive thresholds when giving feedback.

27631789,"Independent component analysis (ICA) as a promising spatial filtering method can separate motor-related independent components (MRICs) from the multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, the unpredictable burst interferences may significantly degrade the performance of ICA-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system. In this study, we proposed a new algorithm frame to address this issue by combining the single-trial-based ICA filter with zero-training classifier. We developed a two-round data selection method to identify automatically the badly corrupted EEG trials in the training set. The ""high quality"" training trials were utilized to optimize the ICA filter. In addition, we proposed an accuracy-matrix method to locate the artifact data segments within a single trial and investigated which types of artifacts can influence the performance of the ICA-based MIBCIs. Twenty-six EEG datasets of three-class motor imagery were used to validate the proposed methods, and the classification accuracies were compared with that obtained by frequently used common spatial pattern (CSP) spatial filtering algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed optimizing strategy could effectively improve the stability, practicality and classification performance of ICA-based MIBCI. The study revealed that rational use of ICA method may be crucial in building a practical ICA-based MIBCI system. "
27598310,"Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) have been developed and implemented in many areas as a new communication channel between the human brain and external devices. Despite their rapid growth and broad popularity, the inaccurate performance and cost of user-training are yet the main issues that prevent their application out of the research and clinical environment. We previously introduced a BCI system for the control of a very humanlike android that could raise a sense of embodiment and agency in the operators only by imagining a movement (motor imagery) and watching the robot perform it. Also using the same setup, we further discovered that the positive bias of subjects' performance both increased their sensation of embodiment and improved their motor imagery skills in a short period. In this work, we studied the shared mechanism between the experience of embodiment and motor imagery. We compared the trend of motor imagery learning when two groups of subjects BCI-operated different looking robots, a very humanlike android's hands and a pair of metallic gripper. Although our experiments did not show a significant change of learning between the two groups immediately during one session, the android group revealed better motor imagery skills in the follow up session when both groups repeated the task using the non-humanlike gripper. This result shows that motor imagery skills learnt during the BCI-operation of humanlike hands are more robust to time and visual feedback changes. We discuss the role of embodiment and mirror neuron system in such outcome and propose the application of androids for efficient BCI training. "
27590965,"In this chapter, we give an overview of the Graz-BCI research, from the classic motor imagery detection to complex movement intentions decoding. We start by describing the classic motor imagery approach, its application in tetraplegic end users, and the significant improvements achieved using coadaptive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). These strategies have the drawback of not mirroring the way one plans a movement. To achieve a more natural control-and to reduce the training time-the movements decoded by the BCI need to be closely related to the user's intention. Within this natural control, we focus on the kinematic level, where movement direction and hand position or velocity can be decoded from noninvasive recordings. First, we review movement execution decoding studies, where we describe the decoding algorithms, their performance, and associated features. Second, we describe the major findings in movement imagination decoding, where we emphasize the importance of estimating the sources of the discriminative features. Third, we introduce movement target decoding, which could allow the determination of the target without knowing the exact movement-by-movement details. Aside from the kinematic level, we also address the goal level, which contains relevant information on the upcoming action. Focusing on hand-object interaction and action context dependency, we discuss the possible impact of some recent neurophysiological findings in the future of BCI control. Ideally, the goal and the kinematic decoding would allow an appropriate matching of the BCI to the end users' needs, overcoming the limitations of the classic motor imagery approach."
27589505,"Hybrid assistive neuromuscular dynamic stimulation (HANDS) therapy improved paretic upper extremity motor function in patients with severe to moderate hemiparesis. We hypothesized that brain machine interface (BMI) training would be able to increase paretic finger muscle activity enough to apply HANDS therapy in patients with severe hemiparesis, whose finger extensor was absent. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of BMI training followed by HANDS therapy in patients with severe hemiparesis. Twenty-nine patients with chronic stroke who could not extend their paretic fingers were participated this study. We applied BMI training for 10 days at 40 min per day. The BMI detected the patients' motor imagery of paretic finger extension with event-related desynchronization (ERD) over the affected primary sensorimotor cortex, recorded with electroencephalography. Patients wore a motor-driven orthosis, which extended their paretic fingers and was triggered with ERD. When muscle activity in their paretic fingers was detected with surface electrodes after 10 days of BMI training, we applied HANDS therapy for the following 3 weeks. In HANDS therapy, participants received closed-loop, electromyogram-controlled, neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) combined with a wrist-hand splint for 3 weeks at 8 hours a day. Before BMI training, after BMI training, after HANDS therapy and 3month after HANDS therapy, we assessed Fugl-Meyer Assessment upper extremity motor score (FMA) and the Motor Activity Log14-Amount of Use (MAL-AOU) score. After 10 days of BMI training, finger extensor activity had appeared in 21 patients. Eighteen of 21 patients then participated in 3 weeks of HANDS therapy. We found a statistically significant improvement in the FMA and the MAL-AOU scores after the BMI training, and further improvement was seen after the HANDS therapy. Combining BMI training with HANDS therapy could be an effective therapeutic strategy for severe UE paralysis after stroke."
27587163,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems provide an alternative communication and control approach for people with limited motor function. Therefore, the feature extraction and classification approach should differentiate the relative unusual state of motion intention from a common resting state. In this paper, we sought a novel approach for multi-class classification in BCI applications. We collected electroencephalographic (EEG) signals registered by electrodes placed over the scalp during left hand motor imagery, right hand motor imagery, and resting state for ten healthy human subjects. We proposed using the Kolmogorov complexity (Kc) for feature extraction and a multi-class Adaboost classifier with extreme learning machine as base classifier for classification, in order to classify the three-class EEG samples. An average classification accuracy of 79.5% was obtained for ten subjects, which greatly outperformed commonly used approaches. Thus, it is concluded that the proposed method could improve the performance for classification of motor imagery tasks for multi-class samples. It could be applied in further studies to generate the control commands to initiate the movement of a robotic exoskeleton or orthosis, which finally facilitates the rehabilitation of disabled people.

27578310,"While motor-imagery based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been studied over many years by now, most of these studies have taken place in controlled lab settings. Bringing BCI technology into everyday life is still one of the main challenges in this field of research. This paper systematically investigates BCI performance under 6 types of distractions that mimic out-of-lab environments. We report results of 16 participants and show that the performance of the standard common spatial patterns (CSP) + regularized linear discriminant analysis classification pipeline drops significantly in this 'simulated' out-of-lab setting. We then investigate three methods for improving the performance: (1) artifact removal, (2) ensemble classification, and (3) a 2-step classification approach. While artifact removal does not enhance the BCI performance significantly, both ensemble classification and the 2-step classification combined with CSP significantly improve the performance compared to the standard procedure. Systematically analyzing out-of-lab scenarios is crucial when bringing BCI into everyday life. Algorithms must be adapted to overcome nonstationary environments in order to tackle real-world challenges."
27563927,"Over the last few decades, brain signals have been significantly exploited for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. In this paper, we study the extraction of features using event-related desynchronization/synchronization techniques to improve the classification accuracy for three-class motor imagery (MI) BCI. The classification approach is based on combining the features of the phase and amplitude of the brain signals using fast Fourier transform (FFT) and autoregressive (AR) modeling of the reconstructed phase space as well as the modification of the BCI parameters (trial length, trial frequency band, classification method). We report interesting results compared with those present in the literature by utilizing sequential forward floating selection (SFFS) and a multi-class linear discriminant analysis (LDA), our findings showed superior classification results, a classification accuracy of 86.06% and 93% for two BCI competition datasets, with respect to results from previous studies.

27544071,"This study presented a paradigm for controlling a car using an asynchronous electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) and presented the experimental results of a simulation performed in an experimental environment outside the laboratory. This paradigm uses two distinct MI tasks, imaginary left- and right-hand movements, to generate a multi-task car control strategy consisting of starting the engine, moving forward, turning left, turning right, moving backward, and stopping the engine. Five healthy subjects participated in the online car control experiment, and all successfully controlled the car by following a previously outlined route. Subject S1 exhibited the most satisfactory BCI-based performance, which was comparable to the manual control-based performance. We hypothesize that the proposed self-paced car control paradigm based on EEG signals could potentially be used in car control applications, and we provide a complementary or alternative way for individuals with locked-in disorders to achieve more mobility in the future, as well as providing a supplementary car-driving strategy to assist healthy people in driving a car."
27542114,"Motor imagery classification is an important topic in brain-computer interface (BCI) research that enables the recognition of a subject's intension to, e.g., implement prosthesis control. The brain dynamics of motor imagery are usually measured by electroencephalography (EEG) as nonstationary time series of low signal-to-noise ratio. Although a variety of methods have been previously developed to learn EEG signal features, the deep learning idea has rarely been explored to generate new representation of EEG features and achieve further performance improvement for motor imagery classification. In this study, a novel deep learning scheme based on restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is proposed. Specifically, frequency domain representations of EEG signals obtained via fast Fourier transform (FFT) and wavelet package decomposition (WPD) are obtained to train three RBMs. These RBMs are then stacked up with an extra output layer to form a four-layer neural network, which is named the frequential deep belief network (FDBN). The output layer employs the softmax regression to accomplish the classification task. Also, the conjugate gradient method and backpropagation are used to fine tune the FDBN. Extensive and systematic experiments have been performed on public benchmark datasets, and the results show that the performance improvement of FDBN over other selected state-of-the-art methods is statistically significant. Also, several findings that may be of significant interest to the BCI community are presented in this article."
27522166,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been used to alter the excitability of neurons within the cerebral cortex. Improvements in motor learning have been found in multiple studies when tDCS was applied to the motor cortex before or during task learning. The motor cortex is also active during the performance of motor imagination, a cognitive task during which a person imagines, but does not execute, a movement. Motor imagery can be used with noninvasive brain computer interfaces (BCIs) to control virtual objects in up to three dimensions, but to master control of such devices requires long training times. To evaluate the effect of high-definition tDCS on the performance and underlying electrophysiology of motor imagery based BCI. We utilize high-definition tDCS to investigate the effect of stimulation on motor imagery-based BCI performance across and within sessions over multiple training days. We report a decreased time-to-hit with anodal stimulation both within and across sessions. We also found differing electrophysiological changes of the stimulated sensorimotor cortex during online BCI task performance for left vs. right trials. Cathodal stimulation led to a decrease in alpha and beta band power during task performance compared to sham stimulation for right hand imagination trials. These results suggest that unilateral tDCS over the sensorimotor motor cortex differentially affects cortical areas based on task specific neural activation."
27514060,"In this work, we propose a novel brain-controlled wheelchair, one of the major applications of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), that allows an individual with mobility impairments to perform daily living activities independently. Specifically, we propose to use a steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (SSSEP) paradigm, which elicits brain responses to tactile stimulation of specific frequencies, for a user's intention to control a wheelchair. In our system, a user had three possible commands by concentrating on one of three vibration stimuli, which were attached to the left-hand, right-hand, and right-foot, to selectively control the wheelchair. The three stimuli were associated with three wheelchair commands: turn-left, turn-right, and move-forward. From a machine learning perspective, we also devise a novel feature representation by combining spatial and spectral characteristics of brain signals. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed SSSEP-based system, we considered two different tasks: 1) a simple obstacle-avoidance task within a limited time and; 2) a driving task along the predefined trajectory of about 40 m length, where there were a narrow pathway, a door, and obstacles. In both experiments, we recruited 12 subjects and compared the average time of motor imagery (MI) and SSSEP-based controls to complete the task. With the SSSEP-based control, all subjects successfully completed the task without making any collision while four subjects failed it with MI-based control. It is also noteworthy that in terms of the average time to complete the task, the SSSEP-based control outperformed the MI-based control. In the other more challenging task, all subjects successfully reached the target location."
27513629,"Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) provide a new assistive strategy aimed at restoring mobility in severely paralyzed patients. Yet, no study in animals or in human subjects has indicated that long-term BMI training could induce any type of clinical recovery. Eight chronic (3-13 years) spinal cord injury (SCI) paraplegics were subjected to long-term training (12 months) with a multi-stage BMI-based gait neurorehabilitation paradigm aimed at restoring locomotion. This paradigm combined intense immersive virtual reality training, enriched visual-tactile feedback, and walking with two EEG-controlled robotic actuators, including a custom-designed lower limb exoskeleton capable of delivering tactile feedback to subjects. Following 12 months of training with this paradigm, all eight patients experienced neurological improvements in somatic sensation (pain localization, fine/crude touch, and proprioceptive sensing) in multiple dermatomes. Patients also regained voluntary motor control in key muscles below the SCI level, as measured by EMGs, resulting in marked improvement in their walking index. As a result, 50% of these patients were upgraded to an incomplete paraplegia classification. Neurological recovery was paralleled by the reemergence of lower limb motor imagery at cortical level. We hypothesize that this unprecedented neurological recovery results from both cortical and spinal cord plasticity triggered by long-term BMI usage."
27503007,"The use of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology in neurorehabilitation provides new strategies to overcome stroke-related motor limitations. Recent studies demonstrated the brain's capacity for functional and structural plasticity through BCI. However, it is not fully clear how we can take full advantage of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying recovery and how to maximize restoration through BCI. In this study we investigate the role of multimodal virtual reality (VR) simulations and motor priming (MP) in an upper limb motor-imagery BCI task in order to maximize the engagement of sensory-motor networks in a broad range of patients who can benefit from virtual rehabilitation training. In order to investigate how different BCI paradigms impact brain activation, we designed 3 experimental conditions in a within-subject design, including an immersive Multimodal Virtual Reality with Motor Priming (VRMP) condition where users had to perform motor-execution before BCI training, an immersive Multimodal VR condition, and a control condition with standard 2D feedback. Further, these were also compared to overt motor-execution. Finally, a set of questionnaires were used to gather subjective data on Workload, Kinesthetic Imagery and Presence. Our findings show increased capacity to modulate and enhance brain activity patterns in all extracted EEG rhythms matching more closely those present during motor-execution and also a strong relationship between electrophysiological data and subjective experience. Our data suggest that both VR and particularly MP can enhance the activation of brain patterns present during overt motor-execution. Further, we show changes in the interhemispheric EEG balance, which might play an important role in the promotion of neural activation and neuroplastic changes in stroke patients in a motor-imagery neurofeedback paradigm. In addition, electrophysiological correlates of psychophysiological responses provide us with valuable information about the motor and affective state of the user that has the potential to be used to predict MI-BCI training outcome based on user's profile. Finally, we propose a BCI paradigm in VR, which gives the possibility of motor priming for patients with low level of motor control."
27474965,"Considering self-rated mental effort during neurofeedback may improve training of brain self-regulation. Twenty-one healthy, right-handed subjects performed kinesthetic motor imagery of opening their left hand, while threshold-based classification of beta-band desynchronization resulted in proprioceptive robotic feedback. The experiment consisted of two blocks in a cross-over design. The participants rated their perceived mental effort nine times per block. In the adaptive block, the threshold was adjusted on the basis of these ratings whereas adjustments were carried out at random in the other block. Electroencephalography was used to examine the cortical activation patterns during the training sessions. The perceived mental effort was correlated with the difficulty threshold of neurofeedback training. Adaptive threshold-setting reduced mental effort and increased the classification accuracy and positive predictive value. This was paralleled by an inter-hemispheric cortical activation pattern in low frequency bands connecting the right frontal and left parietal areas. Optimal balance of mental effort was achieved at thresholds significantly higher than maximum classification accuracy. Rating of mental effort is a feasible approach for effective threshold-adaptation during neurofeedback training. Closed-loop adaptation of the neurofeedback difficulty level facilitates reinforcement learning of brain self-regulation."
27472538,"The balance between action and reward during neurofeedback may influence reinforcement learning of brain self-regulation. Eleven healthy volunteers participated in three runs of motor imagery-based brain-machine interface feedback where a robot passively opened the hand contingent to β-band modulation. For each run, the β-desynchronization threshold to initiate the hand robot movement increased in difficulty (low, moderate, and demanding). In this context, the incentive to learn was estimated by the change of reward per action, operationalized as the change in reward duration per movement onset. Variance analysis revealed a significant interaction between threshold difficulty and the relationship between reward duration and number of movement onsets (p<0.001), indicating a negative learning incentive for low difficulty, but a positive learning incentive for moderate and demanding runs. Exploration of different thresholds in the same data set indicated that the learning incentive peaked at higher thresholds than the threshold which resulted in maximum classification accuracy. Specificity is more important than sensitivity of neurofeedback for reinforcement learning of brain self-regulation. Learning efficiency requires adequate challenge by neurofeedback interventions."
27467528,"Recently, studies have reported the use of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) for developing Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) by applying online pattern classification of brain states from subject-specific fNIRS signals. The purpose of the present study was to develop and test a real-time method for subject-specific and subject-independent classification of multi-channel fNIRS signals using support-vector machines (SVM), so as to determine its feasibility as an online neurofeedback system. Towards this goal, we used left versus right hand movement execution and movement imagery as study paradigms in a series of experiments. In the first two experiments, activations in the motor cortex during movement execution and movement imagery were used to develop subject-dependent models that obtained high classification accuracies thereby indicating the robustness of our classification method. In the third experiment, a generalized classifier-model was developed from the first two experimental data, which was then applied for subject-independent neurofeedback training. Application of this method in new participants showed mean classification accuracy of 63% for movement imagery tasks and 80% for movement execution tasks. These results, and their corresponding offline analysis reported in this study demonstrate that SVM based real-time subject-independent classification of fNIRS signals is feasible. This method has important applications in the field of hemodynamic BCIs, and neuro-rehabilitation where patients can be trained to learn spatio-temporal patterns of healthy brain activity. "
27458384,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) is technology that is developing fast, but it remains inaccurate, unreliable and slow due to the difficulty to obtain precise information from the brain. Consequently, the involvement of other biosignals to decode the user control tasks has risen in importance. A traditional way to operate a BCI system is via motor imagery (MI) tasks. As imaginary movements activate similar cortical structures and vegetative mechanisms as a voluntary movement does, heart rate variability (HRV) has been proposed as a parameter to improve the detection of MI related control tasks. However, HR is very susceptible to body needs and environmental demands, and as BCI systems require high levels of attention, perceptual processing and mental workload, it is important to assess the practical effectiveness of HRV. The present study aimed to determine if brain and heart electrical signals (HRV) are modulated by MI activity used to control a BCI system, or if HRV is modulated by the user perceptions and responses that result from the operation of a BCI system (i.e., user experience). For this purpose, a database of 11 participants who were exposed to eight different situations was used. The sensory-cognitive load (intake and rejection tasks) was controlled in those situations. Two electrophysiological signals were utilized: electroencephalography and electrocardiography. From those biosignals, event-related (de-)synchronization maps and event-related HR changes were respectively estimated. The maps and the HR changes were cross-correlated in order to verify if both biosignals were modulated due to MI activity. The results suggest that HR varies according to the experience undergone by the user in a BCI working environment, and not because of the MI activity used to operate the system. "
27454531,"Brain-computer interfacing (BCI) applications based on the classification of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals require solving high-dimensional pattern classification problems with such a relatively small number of training patterns that curse of dimensionality problems usually arise. Multiresolution analysis (MRA) has useful properties for signal analysis in both temporal and spectral analysis, and has been broadly used in the BCI field. However, MRA usually increases the dimensionality of the input data. Therefore, some approaches to feature selection or feature dimensionality reduction should be considered for improving the performance of the MRA based BCI. This paper investigates feature selection in the MRA-based frameworks for BCI. Several wrapper approaches to evolutionary multiobjective feature selection are proposed with different structures of classifiers. They are evaluated by comparing with baseline methods using sparse representation of features or without feature selection. The statistical analysis, by applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff and Kruskal-Wallis tests to the means of the Kappa values evaluated by using the test patterns in each approach, has demonstrated some advantages of the proposed approaches. In comparison with the baseline MRA approach used in previous studies, the proposed evolutionary multiobjective feature selection approaches provide similar or even better classification performances, with significant reduction in the number of features that need to be computed."
27445783,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) aims to establish communication between the human brain and a computing system so as to enable the interaction between an individual and his environment without using the brain output pathways. Individuals control a BCI system by modulating their brain signals through mental tasks (e.g., motor imagery or mental calculation) or sensory stimulation (e.g., auditory, visual, or tactile). As users modulate their brain signals at different frequencies and at different levels, the appropriate characterization of those signals is necessary. The modulation of brain signals through mental tasks is furthermore a skill that requires training. Unfortunately, not all the users acquire such skill. A practical solution to this problem is to assess the user probability of controlling a BCI system. Another possible solution is to set the bandwidth of the brain oscillations, which is highly sensitive to the users' age, sex and anatomy. With this in mind, NeuroIndex, a Python executable script, estimates a neurophysiological prediction index and the individual alpha frequency (IAF) of the user in question. These two parameters are useful to characterize the user EEG signals, and decide how to go through the complex process of adapting the human brain and the computing system on the basis of previously proposed methods. NeuroIndeX is not only the implementation of those methods, but it also complements the methods each other and provides an alternative way to obtain the prediction parameter. However, an important limitation of this application is its dependency on the IAF value, and some results should be interpreted with caution. The script along with some electroencephalographic datasets are available on a GitHub repository in order to corroborate the functionality and usability of this application. "
27429995,"We provide a brief overview of the research and clinical applications of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in the neurorehabilitation field. NIRS has several potential advantages and shortcomings as a neuroimaging tool and is suitable for research application in the rehabilitation field. As one of the main applications of NIRS, we discuss its application as a monitoring tool, including investigating the neural mechanism of functional recovery after brain damage and investigating the neural mechanisms for controlling bipedal locomotion and postural balance in humans. In addition to being a monitoring tool, advances in signal processing techniques allow us to use NIRS as a therapeutic tool in this field. With a brief summary of recent studies investigating the clinical application of NIRS using motor imagery task, we discuss the possible clinical usage of NIRS in brain-computer interface and neurofeedback.

27416602,"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) seek to infer some task symbol, a task relevant instruction, from brain symbols, classifiable physiological states. For example, in a motor imagery robot control task a user would indicate their choice from a dictionary of task symbols (rotate arm left, grasp, etc.) by selecting from a smaller dictionary of brain symbols (imagined left or right hand movements). We examine how a BCI infers a task symbol using selections of brain symbols. We offer a recursive Bayesian decision framework which incorporates context prior distributions (e.g., language model priors in spelling applications), accounts for varying brain symbol accuracy and is robust to single brain symbol query errors. This framework is paired with Maximum Mutual Information (MMI) coding which maximizes a generalization of ITR. Both are applicable to any discrete task and brain phenomena (e.g., P300, SSVEP, MI). To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach we perform SSVEP ""Shuffle"" Speller experiments and compare our recursive coding scheme with traditional decision tree methods including Huffman coding. MMI coding leverages the asymmetry of the classifier's mistakes across a particular user's SSVEP responses; in doing so it offers a 33% increase in letter accuracy though it is 13% slower in our experiment."
27392361,"In motor imagery brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), the symmetric positive-definite (SPD) covariance matrices of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals carry important discriminative information. In this paper, we intend to classify motor imagery EEG signals by exploiting the fact that the space of SPD matrices endowed with Riemannian distance is a high-dimensional Riemannian manifold. To alleviate the overfitting and heavy computation problems associated with conventional classification methods on high-dimensional manifold, we propose a framework for intrinsic sub-manifold learning from a high-dimensional Riemannian manifold. Considering a special case of SPD space, a simple yet efficient bilinear sub-manifold learning (BSML) algorithm is derived to learn the intrinsic sub-manifold by identifying a bilinear mapping that maximizes the preservation of the local geometry and global structure of the original manifold. Two BSML-based classification algorithms are further proposed to classify the data on a learned intrinsic sub-manifold. Experimental evaluation of the classification of EEG revealed that the BSML method extracts the intrinsic sub-manifold approximately 5× faster and with higher classification accuracy compared with competing algorithms. The BSML also exhibited strong robustness against a small training dataset, which often occurs in BCI studies."
27378253,"Modern applications of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on electroencephalography rely heavily on the so-called wet electrodes (e.g. Ag/AgCl electrodes) which require gel application and skin preparation to operate properly. Recently, alternative 'dry' electrodes have been developed to increase ease of use, but they often suffer from higher electrode-skin impedance and signal instability. In the current paper, we have proposed a novel porous ceramic-based 'semi-dry' electrode. The key feature of the semi-dry electrodes is that their tips can slowly and continuously release a tiny amount of electrolyte liquid to the scalp, which provides an ionic conducting path for detecting neural signals. The performance of the proposed electrode was evaluated by simultaneous recording of the wet and semi-dry electrodes pairs in five classical BCI paradigms: eyes open/closed, the motor imagery BCI, the P300 speller, the N200 speller and the steady-state visually evoked potential-based BCI. The grand-averaged temporal cross-correlation was 0.95 ± 0.07 across the subjects and the nine recording positions, and these cross-correlations were stable throughout the whole experimental protocol. In the spectral domain, the semi-dry/wet coherence was greater than 0.80 at all frequencies and greater than 0.90 at frequencies above 10 Hz, with the exception of a dip around 50 Hz (i.e. the powerline noise). More importantly, the BCI classification accuracies were also comparable between the two types of electrodes. Overall, these results indicate that the proposed semi-dry electrode can effectively capture the electrophysiological responses and is a feasible alternative to the conventional dry electrode in BCI applications."
27377661,"Effective common spatial pattern (CSP) feature extraction for motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings usually depends on the filter band selection to a large extent. Subband optimization has been suggested to enhance classification accuracy of MI. Accordingly, this study introduces a new method that implements sparse Bayesian learning of frequency bands (named SBLFB) from EEG for MI classification. CSP features are extracted on a set of signals that are generated by a filter bank with multiple overlapping subbands from raw EEG data. Sparse Bayesian learning is then exploited to implement selection of significant features with a linear discriminant criterion for classification. The effectiveness of SBLFB is demonstrated on the BCI Competition IV IIb dataset, in comparison with several other competing methods. Experimental results indicate that the SBLFB method is promising for development of an effective classifier to improve MI classification."
27329006,"Two challenges need to be addressed before bringing non-motor mental tasks for brain-computer interface (BCI) control to persons in a minimally conscious state (MCS), who can be behaviorally unresponsive even when proven to be consciously aware: first, keeping the cognitive demands as low as possible so that they could be fulfilled by persons with MCS. Second, increasing the control of experimental protocol (i.e. type and timing of the task performance). The goal of this study is twofold: first goal is to develop an experimental paradigm that can facilitate the performance of brain-teasers (e.g. mental subtraction and word generation) on the one hand, and can increase the control of experimental protocol on the other hand. The second goal of this study is to exploit the similar findings for mentally attending to someone else's verbal performance of brain-teaser tasks and self-performing the same tasks to setup an online BCI, and to compare it in healthy participants to the current ""state-of-the-art"" motor imagery (MI, sports). The response accuracies for the best performing healthy participants indicate that selective attention to verbal performance of mental subtraction (SUB) is a viable alternative to the MI. Time-frequency analysis of the SUB task in one participant with MCS did not reveal any significant (p<0.05) EEG changes, whereas imagined performance of one sport of participants' choice (SPORT) revealed task-related EEG changes over neurophysiological plausible cortical areas. We found that mentally attending to someone else's verbal performance of brain-teaser tasks leads to similar results as in self-performing the same tasks. In this work we demonstrated that a single auditory selective attention task (i.e. mentally attending to someone else's verbal performance of mental subtraction) can modulate both induced and evoked changes in EEG, and be used for yes/no communication in an auditory scanning paradigm."
27303595,"Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems based on Movement Imagination (MI) are widely used in recent decades. Separate feature extraction methods are employed in the MI data sets and classified in Virtual Reality (VR) environments for real-time applications. This study applied wide variety of features on the recorded data using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier to select the best feature sets in the offline mode. The data set was recorded in 3-class tasks of the left hand, the right hand, and the foot motor imagery. The experimental results showed that Auto-Regressive (AR), Mean Absolute Value (MAV), and Band Power (BP) features have higher accuracy values,75% more than those for the other features. These features were selected for the designed real-time navigation. The corresponding results revealed the subject-specific nature of the MI-based BCI system; however, the Power Spectral Density (PSD) based α-BP feature had the highest averaged accuracy."
27282228,"While research on the brain-computer interface (BCI) has been active in recent years, how to get high-quality electrical brain signals to accurately recognize human intentions for reliable communication and interaction is still a challenging task. The evidence has shown that visually guided motor imagery (MI) can modulate sensorimotor electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms in humans, but how to design and implement efficient visual guidance during MI in order to produce better event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns is still unclear. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of using object-oriented movements in a virtual environment as visual guidance on the modulation of sensorimotor EEG rhythms generated by hand MI. To improve the classification accuracy on MI, we further propose an algorithm to automatically extract subject-specific optimal frequency and time bands for the discrimination of ERD patterns produced by left and right hand MI. The experimental results show that the average classification accuracy of object-directed scenarios is much better than that of non-object-directed scenarios (76.87% vs. 69.66%). The result of the t-test measuring the difference between them is statistically significant (p = 0.0207). When compared to algorithms based on fixed frequency and time bands, contralateral dominant ERD patterns can be enhanced by using the subject-specific optimal frequency and the time bands obtained by our proposed algorithm. These findings have the potential to improve the efficacy and robustness of MI-based BCI applications. "
27259085,"The effective connectivity refers explicitly to the influence that one neural system exerts over another in frequency domain. To investigate the propagation of neuronal activity in certain frequency can help us reveal the mechanisms of information processing by brain. This study investigates the detection of effective connectivity and analyzes the complex brain network connection mode associated with motor imagery (MI) tasks. The effective connectivity among the primary motor area is firstly explored using partial directed coherence (PDC) combined with multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) based on electroencephalography (EEG) data. Then a new approach is proposed to analyze the connection mode of the complex brain network via the information flow pattern. Our results demonstrate that significant effective connectivity exists in the bilateral hemisphere during the tasks, regardless of the left-/right-hand MI tasks. Furthermore, the out-in rate results of the information flow reveal the existence of the contralateral lateralization. The classification performance of left-/right-hand MI tasks can be improved by careful selection of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The proposed method can provide efficient features for the detection of MI tasks and has great potential to be applied in brain computer interface (BCI)."
27255798,"The feature extraction and classification of brain signal is very significant in brain-computer interface (BCI). In this study, we describe an algorithm for motor imagery (MI) classification of electrocorticogram (ECoG)-based BCI. The proposed approach employs multi-resolution fractal measures and local binary pattern (LBP) operators to form a combined feature for characterizing an ECoG epoch recording from the right hemisphere of the brain. A classifier is trained by using the gradient boosting in conjunction with ordinary least squares (OLS) method. The fractal intercept, lacunarity and LBP features are extracted to classify imagined movements of either the left small finger or the tongue. Experimental results on dataset I of BCI competition III demonstrate the superior performance of our method. The cross-validation accuracy and accuracy is 90.6% and 95%, respectively. Furthermore, the low computational burden of this method makes it a promising candidate for real-time BCI systems. "
27253616,"Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most popular techniques to record the brain activities such as motor imagery, which is of low signal-to-noise ratio and could lead to high classification error. Therefore, selection of the most discriminative features could be crucial to improve the classification performance. However, the traditional feature selection methods employed in brain-computer interface (BCI) field (e.g. Mutual Information-based Best Individual Feature (MIBIF), Mutual Information-based Rough Set Reduction (MIRSR) and cross-validation) mainly focus on the overall performance on all the trials in the training set, and thus may have very poor performance on some specific samples, which is not acceptable. To address this problem, a novel sequential forward feature selection approach called Dynamic Frequency Feature Selection (DFFS) is proposed in this paper. The DFFS method emphasized the importance of the samples that got misclassified while only pursuing high overall classification performance. In the DFFS based classification scheme, the EEG data was first transformed to frequency domain using Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), which is then employed as the candidate set for further discriminatory feature selection. The features are selected one by one in a boosting manner. After one feature being selected, the importance of the correctly classified samples based on the feature will be decreased, which is equivalent to increasing the importance of the misclassified samples. Therefore, a complement feature to the current features could be selected in the next run. The selected features are then fed to a classifier trained by random forest algorithm. Finally, a time series voting-based method is utilized to improve the classification performance. Comparisons between the DFFS-based approach and state-of-art methods on BCI competition IV data set 2b have been conducted, which have shown the superiority of the proposed algorithm."
27242429,"Pairing peripheral electrical stimulation (ES) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) increases corticospinal excitability when applied with a specific temporal pattern. When the two stimulation techniques are applied separately, motor imagery (MI)-related oscillatory modulation amplifies both ES-related cortical effects-sensorimotor event-related desynchronization (ERD), and TMS-induced peripheral responses-motor-evoked potentials (MEP). However, the influence of brain self-regulation on the associative pairing of these stimulation techniques is still unclear. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the effects of MI-related ERD during associative ES and TMS on subsequent corticospinal excitability. The paired application of functional electrical stimulation (FES) of the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) muscle and subsequent single-pulse TMS (110% resting motor threshold (RMT)) of the contralateral primary motor cortex (M1) was controlled by beta-band (16-22 Hz) ERD during MI of finger extension and applied within a brain-machine interface environment in six healthy subjects. Neural correlates were probed by acquiring the stimulus-response curve (SRC) of both MEP peak-to-peak amplitude and area under the curve (AUC) before and after the intervention. The application of approximately 150 pairs of associative FES and TMS resulted in a significant increase of MEP amplitudes and AUC, indicating that the induced increase of corticospinal excitability was mediated by the recruitment of additional neuronal pools. MEP increases were brain state-dependent and correlated with beta-band ERD, but not with the background EDC muscle activity; this finding was independent of the FES intensity applied. These results could be relevant for developing closed-loop therapeutic approaches such as the application of brain state-dependent, paired associative stimulation (PAS) in the context of neurorehabilitation."
27199630,"For brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that utilize visual cues to direct the user, the neural signals extracted by the computer are representative of ongoing processes, visual evoked responses, and voluntary modulation. We proposed to use three brain signatures for predicting success on a single trial of a BCI task. The first two features, the amplitude and phase of the pre-trial mu amplitude, were chosen as a correlate for cortical excitability. The remaining feature, related to the visually evoked response to the cue, served as a possible measure of fixation and attention to the task. Of these three features, mu rhythm amplitude over the central electrodes at the time of cue presentation and to a lesser extent the single trial visual evoked response were correlated with the success on the subsequent imagery task. Despite the potential for gating trials using these features, an offline gating simulation was limited in its ability to produce an increase in device throughput. This discrepancy highlights a distinction between the identification of predictive features, and the use of this knowledge in an online BCI. Using such a system, we cannot assume that the user will respond similarly when faced with a scenario where feedback is altered by trials that are gated on a regular basis. The results of this study suggest the possibility of using individualized, pre-task neural signatures for personalized, and asynchronous (self-paced) BCI applications, although these effects need to be quantified in a real-time adaptive scenario in a future study.

The brain-computer interface (BCI) controls motor imagery by converting EEG during this process into the commands for an external device. This article presents the results of two-stage study of the clinical use of non-invasive BCI in the rehabilitation of patients with severe hemiparesis caused by focal brain damage. It was found that the ability to control BCI did not depend on the duration of a disease, brain lesion localization and the degree of neurological deficit. The first step of the study involved 36 patients; it showed that the efficacy of rehabilitation was higher in the group with the use of BCI (the score on the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) improved from 1 [0; 2] to 5 [0; 16] points, p = 0.012; no significant improvement was observed in control group). The second step of the study involved 19 patients; the complex BCI-exoskeleton (i.e. with the kinesthetic feedback) was used for motor imagery trainings. The improvement of the motor function of hands was proved by ARAT (the score improved from 2 [0; 37] to 4 [1; 45:5] points, p = 0.005) and Fugl-Meyer scale (from 72 [63; 110 ] to 79 [68; 115] points, p = 0.005)."
27188143,"With the use of functional MRI (fMRI), we studied the changes in brain hemodynamic activity of healthy subjects during motor imagery training with the use brain-computer interface (BCI), which is based on the recognition of EEG patterns of imagined movements. ANOVA dispersion analysis showed there are 14 areas of the brain where statistically sgnificant changes were registered. Detailed analysis of the activity in these areas before and after training (Student's and Mann-Whitney tests) reduced the amount of areas with significantly changed activity to five; these are Brodmann areas 44 and 45, insula, middle frontal gyrus, and anterior cingulate gyrus. We suggest that these changes are caused by the formation of memory traces of those brain activity patterns which are most accurately recognized by BCI classifiers as correspondent with limb movements. We also observed a tendency of increase in the activity of motor imagery after training. The hemodynamic activity in all these 14 areas during real movements was either approximatly the same or significantly higher than during motor imagery; activity during imagined leg movements was higher that that during imagined arm movements, except for the areas of representation of arms."
27172246,"While promising, electroencephaloraphy based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are barely used due to their lack of reliability: 15% to 30% of users are unable to control a BCI. Standard training protocols may be partly responsible as they do not satisfy recommendations from psychology. Our main objective was to determine in practice to what extent standard training protocols impact users' motor imagery based BCI (MI-BCI) control performance. We performed two experiments. The first consisted in evaluating the efficiency of a standard BCI training protocol for the acquisition of non-BCI related skills in a BCI-free context, which enabled us to rule out the possible impact of BCIs on the training outcome. Thus, participants (N = 54) were asked to perform simple motor tasks. The second experiment was aimed at measuring the correlations between motor tasks and MI-BCI performance. The ten best and ten worst performers of the first study were recruited for an MI-BCI experiment during which they had to learn to perform two MI tasks. We also assessed users' spatial ability and pre-training μ rhythm amplitude, as both have been related to MI-BCI performance in the literature. Around 17% of the participants were unable to learn to perform the motor tasks, which is close to the BCI illiteracy rate. This suggests that standard training protocols are suboptimal for skill teaching. No correlation was found between motor tasks and MI-BCI performance. However, spatial ability played an important role in MI-BCI performance. In addition, once the spatial ability covariable had been controlled for, using an ANCOVA, it appeared that participants who faced difficulty during the first experiment improved during the second while the others did not. These studies suggest that (1) standard MI-BCI training protocols are suboptimal for skill teaching, (2) spatial ability is confirmed as impacting on MI-BCI performance, and (3) when faced with difficult pre-training, subjects seemed to explore more strategies and therefore learn better."
27152498,"This work presents a first motor imagery-based, adaptive brain-computer interface (BCI) speller, which is able to exploit application-derived context for improved, simultaneous classifier adaptation and spelling. Online spelling experiments with ten able-bodied users evaluate the ability of our scheme, first, to alleviate non-stationarity of brain signals for restoring the subject's performances, second, to guide naive users into BCI control avoiding initial offline BCI calibration and, third, to outperform regular unsupervised adaptation. Our co-adaptive framework combines the BrainTree speller with smooth-batch linear discriminant analysis adaptation. The latter enjoys contextual assistance through BrainTree's language model to improve online expectation-maximization maximum-likelihood estimation. Our results verify the possibility to restore single-sample classification and BCI command accuracy, as well as spelling speed for expert users. Most importantly, context-aware adaptation performs significantly better than its unsupervised equivalent and similar to the supervised one. Although no significant differences are found with respect to the state-of-the-art PMean approach, the proposed algorithm is shown to be advantageous for 30% of the users. We demonstrate the possibility to circumvent supervised BCI recalibration, saving time without compromising the adaptation quality. On the other hand, we show that this type of classifier adaptation is not as efficient for BCI training purposes."
27137671,"Recent research has reached a consensus on the feasibility of motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) for different applications, especially in stroke rehabilitation. Most MI-BCI systems rely on temporal, spectral, and spatial features of single channels to distinguish different MI patterns. However, no successful communication has been established for a completely locked-in subject. To provide more useful and informative features, it has been recommended to take into account the relationships among electroencephalographic (EEG) sensor/source signals in the form of brain connectivity as an efficient tool of neuroscience. In this review, we briefly report the challenges and limitations of conventional MI-BCIs. Brain connectivity analysis, particularly functional and effective, has been described as one of the most promising approaches for improving MI-BCI performance. An extensive literature on EEG-based MI brain connectivity analysis of healthy subjects is reviewed. We subsequently discuss the brain connectomes during left and right hand, feet, and tongue MI movements. Moreover, key components involved in brain connectivity analysis that considerably affect the results are explained. Finally, possible technical shortcomings that may have influenced the results in previous research are addressed and suggestions are provided."
30695412,"In this study EEG patterns ofsensorimotor rhythm were examined in 10 healthy subjects while perform- ing motor imagery of upper arm and hand movements. Participants received visual feedback through so called brain-computer interface (BCI) used for detection of user-specific spatio-temporal.EEG patterns associated with performed mental tasks. During the course study,.all of the subjects were able to modulate their sensorimotor EEG by performing motor imagery of shoulder and fingers movements. Patterns during imagery of shoulder movements were found to have more pronounced contralateral localization, than those during hand movements' imagery. That led to significantly better classification accuracies of the most lateralized patterns when discriminating between left and right hand (72 and 58% corresponding to shoulder and hand motor imagery). Value of difference of patterns' lateralization indexes had shown strong correlation with classification accuracy, suggests it could be used as a good ref- erence mark for.choosing optimal motor imagery tasks for BCI application."
29446587,The method is described for joint use of electroencephalography and near-infrared spectrography for location of sources of electrophysiological and focuses of hemodynamic brain activity during motor execution and imagination. The sources of electrophysiological and focuses of hemodynamic activity the most relevant for controlling the hybrid brain-computer interface based on motor imagery are revealed and discussed.
27103137,"Motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been widely used for rehabilitation of motor abilities and prosthesis control for patients with motor impairments. However, MI-BCI performance exhibits a wide variability across subjects, and the underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. Several studies have demonstrated that both the fronto-parietal attention network (FPAN) and MI are involved in high-level cognitive processes that are crucial for the control of BCIs. Therefore, we hypothesized that the FPAN may play an important role in MI-BCI performance. In our study, we recorded multi-modal datasets consisting of MI electroencephalography (EEG) signals, T1-weighted structural and resting-state functional MRI data for each subject. MI-BCI performance was evaluated using the common spatial pattern to extract the MI features from EEG signals. One cortical structural feature (cortical thickness (CT)) and two measurements (degree centrality (DC) and eigenvector centrality (EC)) of node centrality were derived from the structural and functional MRI data, respectively. Based on the information extracted from the EEG and MRI, a correlation analysis was used to elucidate the relationships between the FPAN and MI-BCI performance. Our results show that the DC of the right ventral intraparietal sulcus, the EC and CT of the left inferior parietal lobe, and the CT of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were significantly associated with MI-BCI performance. Moreover, the receiver operating characteristic analysis and machine learning classification revealed that the EC and CT of the left IPL could effectively predict the low-aptitude BCI users from the high-aptitude BCI users with 83.3% accuracy. Those findings consistently reveal that the individuals who have efficient FPAN would perform better on MI-BCI. Our findings may deepen the understanding of individual variability in MI-BCI performance, and also may provide a new biomarker to predict individual MI-BCI performance."
27069460,"Facilitating independent living of individuals with upper extremity impairment is a compelling goal for our society. The degree of disability of these individuals could potentially be reduced by using robotic devices that assist their movements in activities of daily living. One approach to control such robotic systems is the use of a brain-computer interface, which detects the user's intention. This study proposes a method for estimating the user's intention using electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. The proposed method is capable of discriminating rest from various imagined arm movements, including grasping and elbow flexion. The features extracted from EEG signals are autoregressive model coefficients, root-mean-square amplitude, and waveform length. Support vector machine was used as a classifier, distinguishing class labels corresponding to rest and imagined arm movements. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using cross-validation. Average accuracies of 91.8 ± 5.8 and 90 ± 4.1 % were obtained for distinguishing rest versus grasping and rest versus elbow flexion. The results show that the proposed scheme provides 18.9, 17.1, and 16.5 % higher classification accuracies for distinguishing rest versus grasping and 21.9, 17.6, and 18.1 % higher classification accuracies for distinguishing rest versus elbow flexion compared with those obtained using filter bank common spatial pattern, band power, and common spatial pattern methods, respectively, which are widely used in the literature."
27052520,"Despite technical advances in brain machine interfaces (BMI), for as-yet unknown reasons the ability to control a BMI remains limited to a subset of users. We investigate whether individual differences in BMI control based on motor imagery (MI) are related to differences in MI ability. We assessed whether differences in kinesthetic and visual MI, in the behavioral accuracy of MI, and in electroencephalographic variables, were able to differentiate between high- versus low-aptitude BMI users. High-aptitude BMI users showed higher MI accuracy as captured by subjective and behavioral measurements, pointing to a prominent role of kinesthetic rather than visual imagery. Additionally, for the first time, we applied mental chronometry, a measure quantifying the degree to which imagined and executed movements share a similar temporal profile. We also identified enhanced lateralized μ-band oscillations over sensorimotor cortices during MI in high- versus low-aptitude BMI users. These findings reveal that subjective, behavioral, and EEG measurements of MI are intimately linked to BMI control. We propose that poor BMI control cannot be ascribed only to intrinsic limitations of EEG recordings and that specific questionnaires and mental chronometry can be used as predictors of BMI performance (without the need to record EEG activity).

27046556,"This work promotes the use of computer-generated imagery -as visual illusions- to speed up motor learning in rehabilitation. In support of this, we adhere the principles of experience-dependent neuroplasticity and the positive impact of virtual reality (VR) thereof. Specifically, post-stroke patients will undergo motor therapy with a surrogate virtual limb that fakes the paralyzed limb. Along these lines, their motor intentions will match the visual evidence, which fosters physiological, functional and structural changes over time, for recovery of lost function in an injured brain. How we make up such an illusion using computer graphics, is central to this paper. "
27046109,"Self-regulation of sensorimotor oscillations is currently researched in neurorehabilitation, e.g. for priming subsequent physiotherapy in stroke patients, and may be modulated by neurofeedback or transcranial brain stimulation. It has still to be demonstrated, however, whether and under which training conditions such brain self-regulation could also result in motor gains. Thirty-two right-handed, healthy subjects participated in a three-day intervention during which they performed 462 trials of kinesthetic motor-imagery while a brain-robot interface (BRI) turned event-related β-band desynchronization of the left sensorimotor cortex into the opening of the right hand by a robotic orthosis. Different training conditions were compared in a parallel-group design: (i) adaptive classifier thresholding and contingent feedback, (ii) adaptive classifier thresholding and non-contingent feedback, (iii) non-adaptive classifier thresholding and contingent feedback, and (iv) non-adaptive classifier thresholding and non-contingent feedback. We studied the task-related cortical physiology with electroencephalography and the behavioral performance in a subsequent isometric motor task. Contingent neurofeedback and adaptive classifier thresholding were critical for learning brain self-regulation which, in turn, led to behavioral gains after the intervention. The acquired skill for sustained sensorimotor β-desynchronization correlated significantly with subsequent motor improvement. Operant learning of brain self-regulation with a BRI may offer a therapeutic perspective for severely affected stroke patients lacking residual hand function."
29708672,"Regarding to the channel selection problem during the classification of electroencephalogram(EEG)signals,we proposed a novel method,Relief-SBS,in this paper.Firstly,the proposed method performed EEG channel selection by combining the principles of Relief and sequential backward selection(SBS)algorithms.And then correlation coefficient was used for classification of EEG signals.The selected channels that achieved optimal classification accuracy were considered as optimal channels.The data recorded from motor imagery task experiments were analyzed,and the results showed that the channels selected with our proposed method achieved excellent classification accuracy,and also outperformed other feature selection methods.In addition,the distribution of the optimal channels was proved to be consistent with the neurophysiological knowledge.This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.It can be well concluded that our proposed method,Relief-SBS,provides a new way for channel selection."
29708318,"One of the key problems of brain-computer interfaces(BCI)is low signal-to-noise ratio(SNR)of electroencephalogram(EEG)signals.It affects recognition performance.To remove the artifact and noise,block under-determined blind source separation method based on the small number of channels is proposed in this paper.The nonstationary EEG signals are turned into block stationary signals by piecewise.The mixing matrix is estimated by the second-order under-determined blind mixing matrix identification.Then,the beamformer based on minimum mean square error separates the original sources of signals.Eventually,the reconstructed EEG for mixed signals removes the unwanted components of source signals to achieve suppressing artifact.The experiment results on the real motor imagery BCI indicated that the block under-determined blind source separation method could reconstruct signals and remove artifact effectively.The accuracy of motor imagery task of BCI has been greatly improved."
29708317,"In the study of the scalp electroencephalogram(EEG)-based brain-computer interface(BCI),individual differences and complex background noise are two main factors which affect the stability of BCI system.For different subjects,therefore,optimization of BCI system parameters is necessary,including the optimal designing of temporal and spatial filters parameters as well as the classifier parameters.In order to improve the accuracy of BCI system,this paper proposes a new BCI information processing method,which combines the optimization design of independent component analysis spatial filter(ICA-SF)with the multiple sub-band features of EEG signals.The four subjects’ three-class motor imagery EEG(MI-EEG)data collected in different periods were analyzed with the proposed method.Experimental results revealed that,during the inner and outer cross-validation of single subject as well as the subject-to-subject validation,the proposed multiple sub-band method always had higher average classification accuracy compared to those with single-band method,and the maximum difference could achieve 6.08% and5.15%,respectively."
29708316,"Aiming at feature selection problem of motor imagery task in brain computer interface(BCI),an algorithm based on mutual information and principal component analysis(PCA)for electroencephalogram(EEG)feature selection is presented.This algorithm introduces the category information,and uses the sum of mutual information matrices between features under different motor imagery category to replace the covariance matrix.The eigenvectors of the sum matrix represent the direction of the principal components and the eigenvalues of the sum matrix are used to determine the dimensionality of principal components.2005 International BCI competition data set was used in our experiments,and four feature extraction methods were adopted,i.e.power spectrum estimation,continuous wavelet transform,wavelet packet decomposition and Hjorth parameters.The proposed feature selection algorithm was adopted to select and combine the most useful features for classification.The results showed that relative to the PCA algorithm,our algorithm had better performance in dimensionality reduction and in classification accuracy with the assistance of support vector machine classifier under the same dimensionality of principal components."
26999151,"In this work, the perception of affordances was analysed in terms of cognitive neuroscience during an interactive experience in a virtual reality environment. In particular, we chose a virtual reality scenario based on the Leap Motion controller: this sensor device captures the movements of the user's hand and fingers, which are reproduced on a computer screen by the proper software applications. For our experiment, we employed a sample of 10 subjects matched by age and sex and chosen among university students. The subjects took part in motor imagery training and immersive affordance condition (a virtual training with Leap Motion and a haptic training with real objects). After each training sessions the subject performed a recognition task, in order to investigate event-related potential (ERP) components. The results revealed significant differences in the attentional components during the Leap Motion training. During Leap Motion session, latencies increased in the occipital lobes, which are entrusted to visual sensory; in contrast, latencies decreased in the frontal lobe, where the brain is mainly activated for attention and action planning.

26970878,"Desynchronization of sensorimotor rhythmic activity increases instantaneous corticospinal excitability, as indexed by amplitudes of motor-evoked potentials (MEP) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The accumulative effect of cortical stimulation in conjunction with sensorimotor desynchronization is, however, unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of repetitive pairing event-related desynchronization (ERD) with TMS of the precentral gyrus on corticospinal excitability. Closed-loop single-pulse TMS was controlled by beta-band (16-22 Hz) ERD during motor-imagery of finger extension and applied within a brain-computer interface environment in eleven healthy subjects. The same number and pattern of stimuli were applied in a control group of eleven subjects during rest, i.e. independent of ERD. To probe for plasticity resistant to depotentiation, stimulation protocols were followed by a depotentiation task. Brain state-dependent application of approximately 300 TMS pulses during beta-ERD resulted in a significant increase of corticospinal excitability. By contrast, the identical stimulation pattern applied independent of beta-ERD in the control experiment resulted in a decrease of corticospinal excitability. These effects persisted beyond the period of stimulation and the depotentiation task. These results could be instrumental in developing new therapeutic approaches such as the application of closed-loop stimulation in the context of neurorehabilitation."
26959029,"Quaternions can be used as an alternative to model the fundamental patterns of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in the time domain. Thus, this article presents a new quaternion-based technique known as quaternion-based signal analysis (QSA) to represent EEG signals obtained using a brain-computer interface (BCI) device to detect and interpret cognitive activity. This quaternion-based signal analysis technique can extract features to represent brain activity related to motor imagery accurately in various mental states. Experimental tests in which users where shown visual graphical cues related to left and right movements were used to collect BCI-recorded signals. These signals were then classified using decision trees (DT), support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) techniques. The quantitative analysis of the classifiers demonstrates that this technique can be used as an alternative in the EEG-signal modeling phase to identify mental states. "
26935230,"Brain activation differs according to lesion location in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, but lesion location-dependent electroencephalographic (EEG) alterations are unclear. Because of the increasing use of EEG-based brain-computer-interface rehabilitation, we examined lesion location-dependent EEG patterns in patients with stroke while they performed motor tasks. Twelve patients with chronic stroke were divided into three subgroups according to their lesion locations: supratentorial lesions that included M1 (SM1+), supratentorial lesions that excluded M1 (SM1-), and infratentorial (INF) lesions. Participants performed three motor tasks [active, passive, and motor imagery (MI)] with supination and grasping movements. The hemispheric asymmetric indexes, which were calculated with laterality coefficients (LCs), the temporal changes in the event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns in the bilateral motor cortex, and the topographical distributions in the 28-channel EEG patterns around the supplementary motor area and bilateral motor cortex of the three participant subgroups were compared with those of the 12 age-matched healthy controls. The SM1+ group exhibited negative LC values in the active and MI motor tasks, while the other patient subgroups exhibited positive LC values. Negative LC values indicate that the ERD/ERS intensity of the ipsilateral hemisphere is higher than the contralateral hemisphere, whereas positive LC values indicate that the ERD/ERS intensity of the contralateral hemisphere is higher than the ipsilateral hemisphere. The LC values of SM1+ and healthy controls differed significantly (rank-sum test, p < 0.05) in both the supination and grasping movements in the active task. The three patient subgroups differed distinctly from each other in the topography analysis. The hemispheric asymmetry and topographic characteristics of the beta band power patterns in the patients with stroke differed according to the location of the lesion, which suggested that EEG analyses of neurorehabilitation should be implemented according to lesion location."
26891350,"In the last years Brain Computer Interface (BCI) technology has benefited from the development of sophisticated machine leaning methods that let the user operate the BCI after a few trials of calibration. One remarkable example is the recent development of co-adaptive techniques that proved to extend the use of BCIs also to people not able to achieve successful control with the standard BCI procedure. Especially for BCIs based on the modulation of the Sensorimotor Rhythm (SMR) these improvements are essential, since a not negligible percentage of users is unable to operate SMR-BCIs efficiently. In this study we evaluated for the first time a fully automatic co-adaptive BCI system on a large scale. A pool of 168 participants naive to BCIs operated the co-adaptive SMR-BCI in one single session. Different psychological interventions were performed prior the BCI session in order to investigate how motor coordination training and relaxation could influence BCI performance. A neurophysiological indicator based on the Power Spectral Density (PSD) was extracted by the recording of few minutes of resting state brain activity and tested as predictor of BCI performances. Results show that high accuracies in operating the BCI could be reached by the majority of the participants before the end of the session. BCI performances could be significantly predicted by the neurophysiological indicator, consolidating the validity of the model previously developed. Anyway, we still found about 22% of users with performance significantly lower than the threshold of efficient BCI control at the end of the session. Being the inter-subject variability still the major problem of BCI technology, we pointed out crucial issues for those who did not achieve sufficient control. Finally, we propose valid developments to move a step forward to the applicability of the promising co-adaptive methods. "
26861347,"Motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is a communication interface between an external machine and the brain. Many kinds of spatial filters are used in BCIs to enhance the electroencephalography (EEG) features related to motor imagery. The approach of channel selection, developed to reserve meaningful EEG channels, is also an important technique for the development of BCIs. However, current BCI systems require a conventional EEG machine and EEG electrodes with conductive gel to acquire multi-channel EEG signals and then transmit these EEG signals to the back-end computer to perform the approach of channel selection. This reduces the convenience of use in daily life and increases the limitations of BCI applications. In order to improve the above issues, a novel wearable channel selection-based brain-computer interface is proposed. Here, retractable comb-shaped active dry electrodes are designed to measure the EEG signals on a hairy site, without conductive gel. By the design of analog CAR spatial filters and the firmware of EEG acquisition module, the function of spatial filters could be performed without any calculation, and channel selection could be performed in the front-end device to improve the practicability of detecting motor imagery in the wearable EEG device directly or in commercial mobile phones or tablets, which may have relatively low system specifications. Finally, the performance of the proposed BCI is investigated, and the experimental results show that the proposed system is a good wearable BCI system prototype. "
26834551,"Brain-computer interfacing (BCI) has recently been applied as a rehabilitation approach for patients with motor disorders, such as stroke. In these closed-loop applications, a brain switch detects the motor intention from brain signals, e.g., scalp EEG, and triggers a neuroprosthetic device, either to deliver sensory feedback or to mimic real movements, thus re-establishing the compromised sensory-motor control loop and promoting neural plasticity. In this context, single trial detection of motor intention with short latency is a prerequisite. The performance of the event detection from EEG recordings is mainly determined by three factors: the type of motor imagery (e.g., repetitive, ballistic), the frequency band (or signal modality) used for discrimination (e.g., alpha, beta, gamma, and MRCP, i.e., movement-related cortical potential), and the processing technique (e.g., time-series analysis, sub-band power estimation). In this study, we investigated single trial EEG traces during movement imagination on healthy individuals, and provided a comprehensive analysis of the performance of a short-latency brain switch when varying these three factors. The morphological investigation showed a cross-subject consistency of a prolonged negative phase in MRCP, and a delayed beta rebound in sensory-motor rhythms during repetitive tasks. The detection performance had the greatest accuracy when using ballistic MRCP with time-series analysis. In this case, the true positive rate (TPR) was ~70% for a detection latency of ~200 ms. The results presented here are of practical relevance for designing BCI systems for motor function rehabilitation. "
26824590,"Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may benefit from brain-computer interfaces (BCI), but the utility of such devices likely will have to account for the functional, cognitive, and behavioral heterogeneity of this neurodegenerative disorder. In this study, a heterogeneous group of patients with ALS participated in a study on BCI based on the P300 event related potential and motor-imagery. The presence of cognitive impairment in these patients significantly reduced the quality of the control signals required to use these communication systems, subsequently impairing performance, regardless of progression of physical symptoms. Loss in performance among the cognitively impaired was accompanied by a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio of task-relevant EEG band power. There was also evidence that behavioral dysfunction negatively affects P300 speller performance. Finally, older participants achieved better performance on the P300 system than the motor-imagery system, indicating a preference of BCI paradigm with age. These findings highlight the importance of considering the heterogeneity of disease when designing BCI augmentative and alternative communication devices for clinical applications."
26824461,"The brain characteristics of different people are not the same. Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) should thus be customized for each individual person. In motor-imagery based synchronous BCIs, a number of parameters (referred to as hyper-parameters) including the EEG frequency bands, the channels and the time intervals from which the features are extracted should be pre-determined based on each subject's brain characteristics. To determine the hyper-parameter values, previous work has relied on manual or semi-automatic methods that are not applicable to high-dimensional search spaces. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic, scalable and computationally inexpensive algorithm that uses Bayesian optimization to tune these hyper-parameters. We then build different classifiers trained on the sets of hyper-parameter values proposed by the Bayesian optimization. A final classifier aggregates the results of the different classifiers. We have applied our method to 21 subjects from three BCI competition datasets. We have conducted rigorous statistical tests, and have shown the positive impact of hyper-parameter optimization in improving the accuracy of BCIs. Furthermore, We have compared our results to those reported in the literature. Unlike the best reported results in the literature, which are based on more sophisticated feature extraction and classification methods, and rely on prestudies to determine the hyper-parameter values, our method has the advantage of being fully automated, uses less sophisticated feature extraction and classification methods, and yields similar or superior results compared to the best performing designs in the literature."
26822435,"A number of studies have been done on movement imagination of motor sequences with a single limb. However, brain oscillatory patterns induced by movement imagination of motor sequences involving multiple limbs have not been reported in recent years. The goal of the present study was to verify the feasibility of application of motor sequences involving multiple limbs to brain-computer interface (BCI) systems based on motor imagery (MI). The changes of EEG patterns and the inter-influence between movements associated with the imagination of motor sequences were also investigated. The experiment, where 12 healthy subjects participated, involved one motor sequence with a single limb and three kinds of motor sequences with two or three limbs. The activity involved mental simulation, imagining playing drums with two conditions (60 and 30 beats per minute for the first and second conditions, respectively). Movement imagination of different limbs in the sequence contributed to time-variant event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns within both mu and beta rhythms, which was more obvious for the second condition compared with the first condition. The ERD values of left/right hand imagery with prior hand imagery were significantly larger than those with prior foot imagery, while the phase locking values (PLVs) between central electrodes and the mesial frontocentral electrode of non-initial movement were significantly larger than those of the initial movement during imagination of motor sequences for both conditions. Classification results showed that the power spectral density (PSD) based method outperformed the multi-class common spatial patterns (multi-CSP) based method: The highest accuracies were 82.86 % and 91.43 %, and the mean values were 65 % and 74.14 % for the first and second conditions, respectively. This work implies that motor sequences involving multiple limbs can be utilized to build a multimodal classification paradigm in MI-based BCI systems, and that prior movement imagination can result in the changes of neural activities in motor areas during subsequent movement imagination in the process of limb switching."
26800319,"Motor imagery (MI) allows one to mentally represent an action without necessarily performing it. Importantly, however, MI is profoundly influenced by the ability to actually execute actions, as demonstrated by the impairment of this ability as a consequence of lesions in motor cortices, limb amputations, movement limiting chronic pain, and spinal cord injury. Understanding MI and its deficits in patients with motor limitations is fundamentally important as development of some brain-computer interfaces and daily life strategies for coping with motor disorders are based on this ability. We explored MI in a large sample of patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) using a comprehensive battery of questionnaires to assess the ability to imagine actions from a first-person or a third-person perspective and also imagine the proprioceptive components of actions. Moreover, we correlated MI skills with personality measures and clinical variables such as the level and completeness of the lesion and the presence of chronic pain. We found that the MI deficits (1) concerned the body parts affected by deafferentation and deefferentation, (2) were present in first- but not in third-person perspectives, and (3) were more altered in the presence of chronic pain. MI is thus closely related to bodily perceptions and representations. Every attempt to devise tools and trainings aimed at improving autonomy needs to consider the cognitive changes due to the body-brain disconnection."
26798330,"Motor imagery electroencephalography is widely used in the brain-computer interface systems. Due to inherent characteristics of electroencephalography signals, accurate and real-time multiclass classification is always challenging. In order to solve this problem, a multiclass posterior probability solution for twin SVM is proposed by the ranking continuous output and pairwise coupling in this paper. First, two-class posterior probability model is constructed to approximate the posterior probability by the ranking continuous output techniques and Platt's estimating method. Secondly, a solution of multiclass probabilistic outputs for twin SVM is provided by combining every pair of class probabilities according to the method of pairwise coupling. Finally, the proposed method is compared with multiclass SVM and twin SVM via voting, and multiclass posterior probability SVM using different coupling approaches. The efficacy on the classification accuracy and time complexity of the proposed method has been demonstrated by both the UCI benchmark datasets and real world EEG data from BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a, respectively.

26795195,"Brain computer interfaces (BCI) can provide communication opportunities for individuals with severe motor disabilities. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) measures cerebral blood flow velocities and can be used to develop a BCI. A previously implemented TCD BCI system used verbal and spatial tasks as control signals; however, the spatial task involved a visual cue that awkwardly diverted the user's attention away from the communication interface. Therefore, vision-independent right-lateralized tasks were investigated. Using a bilateral TCD BCI, ten participants controlled online, an on-screen keyboard using a left-lateralized task (verbal fluency), a right-lateralized task (fist motor imagery or 3D-shape tracing), and unconstrained rest. 3D-shape tracing was generally more discernible from other tasks than was fist motor imagery. Verbal fluency, 3D-shape tracing and unconstrained rest were distinguished from each other using a linear discriminant classifier, achieving a mean agreement of κ=0.43±0.17. These rates are comparable to the best offline three-class TCD BCI accuracies reported thus far. The online communication system achieved a mean information transfer rate (ITR) of 1.08±0.69bits/min with values reaching up to 2.46bits/min, thereby exceeding the ITR of previous online TCD BCIs. These findings demonstrate the potential of a three-class online TCD BCI that does not require visual task cues. "
26748791,"A motor-imagery-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is a translator that converts the motor intention of the brain into a control command to control external machines without muscles. Numerous motor-imagery-based BCIs have been successfully proposed in previous studies. However, several electroencephalogram (EEG) channels are typically required for providing sufficient information to maintain a specific accuracy and bit rate, and the bulk volume of these EEG machines is also inconvenient. A wearable motor imagery-based BCI system was proposed and implemented in this study. A wearable mechanical design with novel active comb-shaped dry electrodes was developed to measure EEG signals without conductive gels at hair sites, which is easy and convenient for users wearing the EEG machine. In addition, a wireless EEG acquisition module was also designed to measure EEG signals, which provides a user with more freedom of motion. The proposed wearable motor-imagery-based BCI system was validated using an electrical specifications test and a hand motor imagery experiment. Experimental results showed that the proposed wearable motor-imagery-based BCI system provides favorable signal quality for measuring EEG signals and detecting motor imagery. "
26737813,"In the field of neurorehabilitation with brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) technology, an EEG feature, event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/S) caused by motor imagery (MI) is widely used for estimating human motor intention. However, sufficient neurofeedback training is required for the use of the MI-based BCI system, because the ability to generate ERD/S is highly dependent on individuals. To find an effective MI condition for the BCI system, we hypothesize that having a conscious target during MI would enhance the extent of ERD/S. In the experiments, we investigated the individual effect of two types of MIs: leg extension (L) and leg extension with a conscious target (i.e., kicking a ball (KB)) on the resultant ERD/S. We evaluated time-frequency maps of ERD/S and statistically compared these two conditions (i.e., L and KB). As a result, a significant difference was found in beta-ERD (paired t-test, p <; 0.01), while there were no significant differences in mu-ERD and beta-ERS. These results suggest that having a conscious target during lower extremity MI would strengthen the ERD in beta frequency band compared to the case without target. "
26737159,"Imaginary motor tasks cause brain oscillations that can be detected through the analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. This article aims at studying whether or not the characteristics of the brain activity induced by the combined motor imagery (MI) of both hands can be assumed as the superposition of the activity generated during simple hand MIs. After analyzing the sensorimotor rhythms in EEG signals of five healthy subjects, results show that the imagination of both hands movement generates in each brain hemisphere similar activity as the one produced by each simple hand MI in the contralateral side. Furthermore, during simple hand MIs, brain activity over the ipsilateral hemisphere presents similar characteristics as those observed during the rest condition. Thus, it is shown that the proposed scheme is valid and promising for brain-computer interfaces (BCI) control, allowing to easily detect patterns induced by combined MIs. "
26736893,"Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) enable human brains to interact directly with machines. Motor imagery based BCI (MI-BCI) encodes the motor intentions of human agents and provides feedback accordingly. However, 15-30% of people are not able to perform vivid motor imagery. To save time and monetary resources, a number of predictors have been proposed to screen for users with low BCI aptitude. While the proposed predictors provide some level of correlation with MI-BCI performance, simple, objective and accurate predictors are currently not available. Thus, in this study we have examined the utility of a simple reaction time (SRT) test for predicting MI-BCI performance. We enrolled 10 subjects and measured their motor imagery performance with either visual or proprioceptive feedback. Their reaction time was also measured using a SRT test. The results show a significant negative correlation (r ≈ -0.67) between SRT and MI-BCI performance. Therefore SRT may be used as a simple and reliable predictor of MI-BCI performance."
26736664,"Artefacts in recordings of the electroencephalogram (EEG) are a common problem in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). Artefacts make it difficult to calibrate from training sessions, resulting in low test performance, or lead to artificially high performance when unintentionally used for BCI control. We investigate different artefacts' effects on motor-imagery based BCI relying on Common Spatial Patterns (CSP). Data stem from an 80-subject BCI study. We use the recently developed classifier IC_MARC to classify independent components of EEG data into neural and five classes of artefacts. We find that muscle, but not ocular, artefacts adversely affect BCI performance when all 119 EEG channels are used. Artefacts have little influence when using 48 centrally located EEG channels in a configuration previously found to be optimal."
26736620,"Intention recognition through decoding brain activity could lead to a powerful and independent Brain-Computer-Interface (BCI) allowing for intuitive control of devices like robots. A common strategy for realizing such a system is the motor imagery (MI) BCI using electroencephalography (EEG). Changing to invasive recordings like electrocorticography (ECoG) allows extracting very robust features and easy introduction of an idle state, which might simplify the mental task and allow the subject to focus on the environment. Especially for multi-channel recordings like ECoG, common spatial patterns (CSP) provide a powerful tool for feature optimization and dimensionality reduction. This work focuses on an invasive and independent MI BCI that allows triggering from an idle state, and therefore facilitates tele-operation of a humanoid robot. The task was to lift a can with the robot's hand. One subject participated and reached 95.4 % mean online accuracy after six runs of 40 trials. To our knowledge, this is the first online experiment with a MI BCI using CSPs from ECoG signals. "
26736549,We describe a hybrid brain computer interface that integrates gaze information from an eye tracker with brain activity information measured by electroencephalography (EEG). Users explicitly control the end effector of a robot arm to move in one of four directions using motor imagery to perform a pick and place task. Measurements of the natural eye gaze behavior of subjects is used to infer the instantaneous intent of the users based on the past gaze trajectory. This information is integrated with the output of the EEG classifier and contextual information about the environment probabilistically using Bayesian inference. Our experiments demonstrate that subjects can achieve 100% task completion within three minutes and that the integration of EEG and gaze information significantly improves performance over either cue in isolation.
26736449,"In this work we used multimodal, non-invasive brain signal recording systems, namely Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), disc electrode electroencephalography (EEG) and tripolar concentric ring electrodes (TCRE) electroencephalography (tEEG). 7 healthy subjects participated in our experiments to control a 2-D Brain Computer Interface (BCI). Four motor imagery task were performed, imagery motion of the left hand, the right hand, both hands and both feet. The signal slope (SS) of the change in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration measured by NIRS was used for feature extraction while the power spectrum density (PSD) of both EEG and tEEG in the frequency band 8-30Hz was used for feature extraction. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was used to classify different combinations of the aforementioned features. The highest classification accuracy (85.2%) was achieved by using features from all the three brain signals recording modules. The improvement in classification accuracy was highly significant (p = 0.0033) when using the multimodal signals features as compared to pure EEG features."
26736445,"Sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) typically require lengthy user training. This can be exhausting and fatiguing for the user as data collection may be monotonous and typically without any feedback for user motivation. Hence new ways to reduce user training and improve performance are needed. We recently introduced a two class motor imagery BCI system which continuously adapted with increasing run-time to the brain patterns of the user. The system was designed to provide visual feedback to the user after just five minutes. The aim of the current work was to improve user-specific online adaptation, which was expected to lead to higher performances. To maximize SMR discrimination, the method of filter-bank common spatial patterns (fbCSP) and Random Forest (RF) classifier were combined. In a supporting online study, all volunteers performed significantly better than chance. Overall peak accuracy of 88.6 ± 6.1 (SD) % was reached, which significantly exceeded the performance of our previous system by 13%. Therefore, we consider this system the next step towards fully auto-calibrating motor imagery BCIs."
26736310,"Non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) provides a novel means of communication. This can be achieved by measuring electroencephalogram (EEG) signal over the sensory motor cortex of a person performing motor imagery (MI) tasks. However, the performance of BCI remains currently too low to be of wide practical use. A hybrid BCI system could improve the performance by combining two or more modalities such as eye tracking, and the detection of brain activity responses. In this paper, first, we propose a simultaneous hybrid BCI that combines an event-related de-synchronization (ERD) BCI and an eye tracker. Second, we aim to further improve performance by increasing the number of commands (i.e., the number of choices accessible to the user). In particular, we show a significant improvement in performance for a simultaneous gaze-MI system using a total of eight commands. The experimental task requires subjects to search for spatially located items using gaze, and select an item using MI signals. This experimental task studied visuomotor compatible and incompatible conditions. As incorporating incompatible conditions between gaze direction and MI can increase the number of choices in the hybrid BCI, our experimental task includes single-trial detection for average, compatible and incompatible conditions, using seven different classification methods. The mean accuracy for MI, and the information transfer rate (ITR) for the compatible condition is found to be higher than the average and the incompatible conditions. The results suggest that gaze-MI hybrid BCI systems can increase the number of commands, and the location of the items should be taken into account for designing the system."
26724935,"The accuracy of the classification of user intentions is essential for motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI). Effective and appropriate training for users could help us produce the high reliability of mind decision making related with MI tasks. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of visual guidance on the classification performance of MI-based BCI. In this study, leveraging both the single-subject and the multi-subject BCI paradigms, we train and classify MI tasks with three different scenarios in a 3D virtual environment, including non-object-directed scenario, static-object-directed scenario, and dynamic object-directed scenario. Subjects are required to imagine left-hand or right-hand movement with the visual guidance. We demonstrate that the classification performances of left-hand and right-hand MI task have differences on these three scenarios, and confirm that both static-object-directed and dynamic object-directed scenarios could provide better classification accuracy than the non-object-directed case. We further indicate that both static-object-directed and dynamic object-directed scenarios could shorten the response time as well as be suitable applied in the case of small training data. In addition, experiment results demonstrate that the multi-subject BCI paradigm could improve the classification performance comparing with the single-subject paradigm. These results suggest that it is possible to improve the classification performance with the appropriate visual guidance and better BCI paradigm. We believe that our findings would have the potential for improving classification performance of MI-based BCI and being applied in the practical applications."
26710441,"In order to improve the accuracy of classification with small amount of motor imagery training data on the development of brain-computer interface (BCD systems, we proposed an analyzing method to automatically select the characteristic parameters based on correlation coefficient analysis. Throughout the five sample data of dataset IV a from 2005 BCI Competition, we utilized short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and correlation coefficient calculation to reduce the number of primitive electroencephalogram dimension, then introduced feature extraction based on common spatial pattern (CSP) and classified by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Simulation results showed that the average rate of classification accuracy could be improved by using correlation coefficient feature selection method than those without using this algorithm. Comparing with support vector machine (SVM) optimization features algorithm, the correlation coefficient analysis can lead better selection parameters to improve the accuracy of classification."
26699697,"Using a commercial electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI), the training and testing protocol for six individuals with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy (GMFCS and MACS IV and V) was evaluated. A customised, gamified training paradigm was employed. Over three weeks, the participants spent two sessions exploring the system, and up to six sessions playing the game which focussed on EEG feedback of left and right arm motor imagery. The participants showed variable inconclusive results in the ability to produce two distinct EEG patterns. Participant performance was influenced by physical illness, motivation, fatigue and concentration. The results from this case study highlight the infancy of BCIs as a form of assistive technology for people with cerebral palsy. Existing commercial BCIs are not designed according to the needs of end-users. Implications for Rehabilitation Mood, fatigue, physical illness and motivation influence the usability of a brain-computer interface. Commercial brain-computer interfaces are not designed for practical assistive technology use for people with cerebral palsy. Practical brain-computer interface assistive technologies may need to be flexible to suit individual needs."
26641241,"Motor imagery is a conventional method for brain computer interface and motor learning. To avoid the great individual difference of the motor imagery ability, object-oriented motor imagery was applied, and the effects were studied. Kinesthetic motor imagery and visual observation were administered to 15 healthy volunteers. The EEG during cue-based simple imagery (SI), object-oriented motor imagery (OI), non-object-oriented motor imagery (NI) and visual observation (VO) was recorded. Study results showed that OI and NI presented significant contralateral suppression in mu rhythm (p < 0.05). Besides, OI exhibited significant contralateral suppression in beta rhythm (p < 0.05). While no significant mu or beta contralateral suppression could be found during VO or SI (p > 0.05). Compared with NI, OI showed significant difference (p < 0.05) in mu rhythm and weak significant difference (p = 0.0612) in beta rhythm over the contralateral hemisphere. The ability of motor imagery can be reflected by the suppression degree of mu and beta frequencies which are the motor related rhythms. Thus, greater enhancement of activation in mirror neuron system is involved in response to object-oriented motor imagery. The object-oriented motor imagery is favorable for improvement of motor imagery ability. "
26635587,"A motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that enables humans to interact with their environment by translating their brain signals into control commands for a target device. In particular, synchronous BCI systems make use of cues to trigger the motor activity of interest. So far, it has been shown that electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns before and after cue onset can reveal the user cognitive state and enhance the discrimination of MI-related control tasks. However, there has been no detailed investigation of the nature of those EEG patterns. We, therefore, propose to study the cue effects on MI-related control tasks by selecting EEG patterns that best discriminate such control tasks, and analyzing where those patterns are coming from. The study was carried out using two methods: standard and all-embracing. The standard method was based on sources (recording sites, frequency bands, and time windows), where the modulation of EEG signals due to motor activity is typically detected. The all-embracing method included a wider variety of sources, where not only motor activity is reflected. The findings of this study showed that the classification accuracy (CA) of MI-related control tasks did not depend on the type of cue in use. However, EEG patterns that best differentiated those control tasks emerged from sources well defined by the perception and cognition of the cue in use. An implication of this study is the possibility of obtaining different control commands that could be detected with the same accuracy. Since different cues trigger control tasks that yield similar CAs, and those control tasks produce EEG patterns differentiated by the cue nature, this leads to accelerate the brain-computer communication by having a wider variety of detectable control commands. This is an important issue for Neuroergonomics research because neural activity could not only be used to monitor the human mental state as is typically done, but this activity might be also employed to control the system of interest. "
26625261,"Mental-Imagery based Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) allow their users to send commands to a computer using their brain-activity alone (typically measured by ElectroEncephaloGraphy-EEG), which is processed while they perform specific mental tasks. While very promising, MI-BCIs remain barely used outside laboratories because of the difficulty encountered by users to control them. Indeed, although some users obtain good control performances after training, a substantial proportion remains unable to reliably control an MI-BCI. This huge variability in user-performance led the community to look for predictors of MI-BCI control ability. However, these predictors were only explored for motor-imagery based BCIs, and mostly for a single training session per subject. In this study, 18 participants were instructed to learn to control an EEG-based MI-BCI by performing 3 MI-tasks, 2 of which were non-motor tasks, across 6 training sessions, on 6 different days. Relationships between the participants' BCI control performances and their personality, cognitive profile and neurophysiological markers were explored. While no relevant relationships with neurophysiological markers were found, strong correlations between MI-BCI performances and mental-rotation scores (reflecting spatial abilities) were revealed. Also, a predictive model of MI-BCI performance based on psychometric questionnaire scores was proposed. A leave-one-subject-out cross validation process revealed the stability and reliability of this model: it enabled to predict participants' performance with a mean error of less than 3 points. This study determined how users' profiles impact their MI-BCI control ability and thus clears the way for designing novel MI-BCI training protocols, adapted to the profile of each user. "
26602980,"Over the last few decades, motor imagery has attracted the attention of researchers as a prototypical example of 'embodied cognition' and also as a basis for neuro-rehabilitation and brain-machine interfaces. The current definition of motor imagery is widely accepted, but it is important to note that various abilities rather than a single cognitive entity are dealt with under a single term. Here, motor imagery has been characterized based on four factors: (1) motor control, (2) explicitness, (3) sensory modalities, and (4) agency. Sorting out these factors characterizing motor imagery may explain some discrepancies and variability in the findings from previous studies and will help to optimize a study design in accordance with the purpose of each study in the future.

26599827,"Multiresolution analysis (MRA) over graph representation of EEG data has proved to be a promising method for offline brain-computer interfacing (BCI) data analysis. For the first time we aim to prove the feasibility of the graph lifting transform in an online BCI system. Instead of developing a pointer device or a wheel-chair controller as test bed for human-machine interaction, we have designed and developed an engaging game which can be controlled by means of imaginary limb movements. Some modifications to the existing MRA analysis over graphs for BCI have also been proposed, such as the use of common spatial patterns for feature extraction at the different levels of decomposition, and sequential floating forward search as a best basis selection technique. In the online game experiment we obtained for three classes an average classification rate of 63.0% for fourteen naive subjects. The application of a best basis selection method helps significantly decrease the computing resources needed. The present study allows us to further understand and assess the benefits of the use of tailored wavelet analysis for processing motor imagery data and contributes to the further development of BCI for gaming purposes.

26586832,"Humans shape their hands to grasp, manipulate objects, and to communicate. From nonhuman primate studies, we know that visual and motor properties for grasps can be derived from cells in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Are non-grasp-related hand shapes in humans represented similarly? Here we show for the first time how single neurons in the PPC of humans are selective for particular imagined hand shapes independent of graspable objects. We find that motor imagery to shape the hand can be successfully decoded from the PPC by implementing a version of the popular Rock-Paper-Scissors game and its extension Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock. By simultaneous presentation of visual and auditory cues, we can discriminate motor imagery from visual information and show differences in auditory and visual information processing in the PPC. These results also demonstrate that neural signals from human PPC can be used to drive a dexterous cortical neuroprosthesis. This study shows for the first time hand-shape decoding from human PPC. Unlike nonhuman primate studies in which the visual stimuli are the objects to be grasped, the visually cued hand shapes that we use are independent of the stimuli. Furthermore, we can show that distinct neuronal populations are activated for the visual cue and the imagined hand shape. Additionally we found that auditory and visual stimuli that cue the same hand shape are processed differently in PPC. Early on in a trial, only the visual stimuli and not the auditory stimuli can be decoded. During the later stages of a trial, the motor imagery for a particular hand shape can be decoded for both modalities."
26584583,"An EEG classifier is proposed for application in the analysis of motor imagery (MI) EEG data from a brain-computer interface (BCI) competition in this study. Applying subject-action-related brainwave data acquired from the sensorimotor cortices, the system primarily consists of artifact and background removal, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. In addition to background noise, the electrooculographic (EOG) artifacts are also automatically removed to further improve the analysis of EEG signals. Several potential features, including amplitude modulation, spectral power and asymmetry ratio, adaptive autoregressive model, and wavelet fuzzy approximate entropy (wfApEn) that can measure and quantify the complexity or irregularity of EEG signals, are then extracted for subsequent classification. Finally, the significant sub-features are selected from feature combination by quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization and then classified by support vector machine (SVM). Compared with feature extraction without wfApEn on MI data from two data sets for nine subjects, the results indicate that the proposed system including wfApEn obtains better performance in average classification accuracy of 88.2% and average number of commands per minute of 12.1, which is promising in the BCI work applications.

26575032,"In the present study, we show for the first time that motor imagery of swallowing, which is defined as the mental imagination of a specific motor act without overt movements by muscular activity, can be successfully used as mental strategy in a neurofeedback training paradigm. Furthermore, we demonstrate its effects on cortical correlates of swallowing function. Therefore, N = 20 healthy young adults were trained to voluntarily increase their hemodynamic response in swallowing related brain areas as assessed with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). During seven training sessions, participants received either feedback of concentration changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb group, N = 10) or deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb group, N = 10) over the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) during motor imagery of swallowing. Before and after the training, we assessed cortical activation patterns during motor execution and imagery of swallowing. The deoxy-Hb group was able to voluntarily increase deoxy-Hb over the IFG during imagery of swallowing. Furthermore, swallowing related cortical activation patterns were more pronounced during motor execution and imagery after the training compared to the pre-test, indicating cortical reorganization due to neurofeedback training. The oxy-Hb group could neither control oxy-Hb during neurofeedback training nor showed any cortical changes. Hence, successful modulation of deoxy-Hb over swallowing related brain areas led to cortical reorganization and might be useful for future treatments of swallowing dysfunction. "
26539089,"While earlier Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) studies have mostly focused on modulating specific brain regions or signals, new developments in pattern classification of brain states are enabling real-time decoding and modulation of an entire functional network. The present study proposes a new method for real-time pattern classification and neurofeedback of brain states from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. It involves the creation of a fused classification model based on the method of Common Spatial Patterns (CSPs) from data of several healthy individuals. The subject-independent model is then used to classify EEG data in real-time and provide feedback to new individuals. In a series of offline experiments involving training and testing of the classifier with individual data from 27 healthy subjects, a mean classification accuracy of 75.30% was achieved, demonstrating that the classification system at hand can reliably decode two types of imagery used in our experiments, i.e., happy emotional imagery and motor imagery. In a subsequent experiment it is shown that the classifier can be used to provide neurofeedback to new subjects, and that these subjects learn to ""match"" their brain pattern to that of the fused classification model in a few days of neurofeedback training. This finding can have important implications for future studies on neurofeedback and its clinical applications on neuropsychiatric disorders. "
26529439,"Motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) systems hold promise in motor function rehabilitation and assistance for motor function impaired people. But the ability to operate an MI-BCI varies across subjects, which becomes a substantial problem for practical BCI applications beyond the laboratory. Several previous studies have demonstrated that individual MI-BCI performance is related to the resting state of brain. In this study, we further investigate offline MI-BCI performance variations through the perspective of resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) network. Spatial topologies and statistical measures of the network have close relationships with MI classification accuracy. Specifically, mean functional connectivity, node degrees, edge strengths, clustering coefficient, local efficiency and global efficiency are positively correlated with MI classification accuracy, whereas the characteristic path length is negatively correlated with MI classification accuracy. The above results indicate that an efficient background EEG network may facilitate MI-BCI performance. Finally, a multiple linear regression model was adopted to predict subjects' MI classification accuracy based on the efficiency measures of the resting-state EEG network, resulting in a reliable prediction. This study reveals the network mechanisms of the MI-BCI and may help to find new strategies for improving MI-BCI performance."
26528168,"While robot-assisted arm and hand training after stroke allows for intensive task-oriented practice, it has provided only limited additional benefit over dose-matched physiotherapy up to now. These rehabilitation devices are possibly too supportive during the exercises. Neurophysiological signals might be one way of avoiding slacking and providing robotic support only when the brain is particularly responsive to peripheral input. We tested the feasibility of three-dimensional robotic assistance for reaching movements with a multi-joint exoskeleton during motor imagery (MI)-related desynchronization of sensorimotor oscillations in the β-band. We also registered task-related network changes of cortical functional connectivity by electroencephalography via the imaginary part of the coherence function. Healthy subjects and stroke survivors showed similar patterns-but different aptitudes-of controlling the robotic movement. All participants in this pilot study with nine healthy subjects and two stroke patients achieved their maximum performance during the early stages of the task. Robotic control was significantly higher and less variable when proprioceptive feedback was provided in addition to visual feedback, i.e., when the orthosis was actually attached to the subject's arm during the task. A distributed cortical network of task-related coherent activity in the θ-band showed significant differences between healthy subjects and stroke patients as well as between early and late periods of the task. Brain-robot interfaces (BRIs) may successfully link three-dimensional robotic training to the participants' efforts and allow for task-oriented practice of activities of daily living with a physiologically controlled multi-joint exoskeleton. Changes of cortical physiology during the task might also help to make subject-specific adjustments of task difficulty and guide adjunct interventions to facilitate motor learning for functional restoration, a proposal that warrants further investigation in a larger cohort of stroke patients. "
26505298,"Brain-robot interfaces (BRI) are studied as novel interventions to facilitate functional restoration in patients with severe and persistent motor deficits following stroke. They bridge the impaired connection in the sensorimotor loop by providing brain-state dependent proprioceptive feedback with orthotic devices attached to the hand or arm of the patients. The underlying neurophysiology of this BRI neuromodulation is still largely unknown. We investigated changes of corticospinal excitability with transcranial magnetic stimulation in thirteen right-handed healthy subjects who performed 40min of kinesthetic motor imagery receiving proprioceptive feedback with a robotic orthosis attached to the left hand contingent to event-related desynchronization of the right sensorimotor cortex in the β-band (16-22Hz). Neural correlates of this BRI intervention were probed by acquiring the stimulus-response curve (SRC) of both motor evoked potential (MEP) peak-to-peak amplitudes and areas under the curve. In addition, a motor mapping was obtained. The specificity of the effects was studied by comparing two neighboring hand muscles, one BRI-trained and one control muscle. Robust changes of MEP amplitude but not MEP area occurred following the BRI intervention, but only in the BRI-trained muscle. The steep part of the SRC showed an MEP increase, while the plateau of the SRC showed an MEP decrease. MEP mapping revealed a distributed pattern with a decrease of excitability in the hand area of the primary motor cortex, which controlled the BRI, but an increase of excitability in the surrounding somatosensory and premotor cortex. In conclusion, the BRI intervention induced a complex pattern of modulated corticospinal excitability, which may boost subsequent motor learning during physiotherapy."
26489759,"For sensorimotor rhythms based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, classification of different motor imageries (MIs) remains a crucial problem. An important aspect is how many scalp electrodes (channels) should be used in order to reach optimal performance classifying motor imaginations. While the previous researches on channel selection mainly focus on MI tasks paradigms without feedback, the present work aims to investigate the optimal channel selection in MI tasks paradigms with real-time feedback (two-class control and four-class control paradigms). In the present study, three datasets respectively recorded from MI tasks experiment, two-class control and four-class control experiments were analyzed offline. Multiple frequency-spatial synthesized features were comprehensively extracted from every channel, and a new enhanced method IterRelCen was proposed to perform channel selection. IterRelCen was constructed based on Relief algorithm, but was enhanced from two aspects: change of target sample selection strategy and adoption of the idea of iterative computation, and thus performed more robust in feature selection. Finally, a multiclass support vector machine was applied as the classifier. The least number of channels that yield the best classification accuracy were considered as the optimal channels. One-way ANOVA was employed to test the significance of performance improvement among using optimal channels, all the channels and three typical MI channels (C3, C4, Cz). The results show that the proposed method outperformed other channel selection methods by achieving average classification accuracies of 85.2, 94.1, and 83.2 % for the three datasets, respectively. Moreover, the channel selection results reveal that the average numbers of optimal channels were significantly different among the three MI paradigms. It is demonstrated that IterRelCen has a strong ability for feature selection. In addition, the results have shown that the numbers of optimal channels in the three different motor imagery BCI paradigms are distinct. From a MI task paradigm, to a two-class control paradigm, and to a four-class control paradigm, the number of required channels for optimizing the classification accuracy increased. These findings may provide useful information to optimize EEG based BCI systems, and further improve the performance of noninvasive BCI."
26485971,"High-density channels are often used to acquire electroencephalogram (EEG) spatial information in different cortical regions of the brain in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. However, applying excessive channels is inconvenient for signal acquisition, and it may bring artifacts. To avoid these defects, the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm was used for channel selection and a selection criteria based on norm-2 is proposed in this paper. The channels with the highest M scores were selected for the purpose of using fewer channels to acquire similar rate with high density channels. The Dataset III a from BCI competition 2005 were used for comparing the classification accuracies of three motor imagery between whole channels and the selected channels with the present proposed method. The experimental results showed that the classification accuracies of three subjects using the 20 channels selected with the present method were all higher than the classification accuracies using all 60 channels, which convinced that our method could be more effective and useful."
26476869,"As a consequence of the increase of cerebro-vascular accidents, the number of people suffering from motor disabilities is raising. Exoskeletons, Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) devices and Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) could be combined for rehabilitation purposes in order to improve therapy outcomes. In this work, a system based on a hybrid upper limb exoskeleton is used for neurological rehabilitation. Reaching movements are supported by the passive exoskeleton ArmeoSpring and FES. The movement execution is triggered by an EEG-based BMI. The BMI uses two different methods to interact with the exoskeleton from the user's brain activity. The first method relies on motor imagery tasks classification, whilst the second one is based on movement intention detection. Three healthy users and five patients with neurological conditions participated in the experiments to verify the usability of the system. Using the BMI based on motor imagery, healthy volunteers obtained an average accuracy of 82.9 ± 14.5 %, and patients obtained an accuracy of 65.3 ± 9.0 %, with a low False Positives rate (FP) (19.2 ± 10.4 % and 15.0 ± 8.4 %, respectively). On the other hand, by using the BMI based on detecting the arm movement intention, the average accuracy was 76.7 ± 13.2 % for healthy users and 71.6 ± 15.8 % for patients, with 28.7 ± 19.9 % and 21.2 ± 13.3 % of FP rate (healthy users and patients, respectively). The accuracy of the results shows that the combined use of a hybrid upper limb exoskeleton and a BMI could be used for rehabilitation therapies. The advantage of this system is that the user is an active part of the rehabilitation procedure. The next step will be to verify what are the clinical benefits for the patients using this new rehabilitation procedure."
26452197,"Feature extraction is one of the most important steps in any brain-computer interface (BCI) system. In particular, spatio-spectral feature extraction for motor-imagery BCIs (MI-BCI) has been the focus of several works in the past decade. This paper proposes a novel method, called separable common spatio-spectral patterns (SCSSP), for extraction of discriminant spatio-spectral EEG features in MI-BCIs. Assuming a binary classification problem, SCSSP uses a heteroscedastic matrix-variate Gaussian model for the multiband EEG rhythms, and seeks the spatio-spectral features whose variance is maximized for one brain task and minimized for the other task. Therefore, SCSSP can be considered as a spatio-spectral generalization of the conventional common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm. The experimental results on two-class and multiclass motor-imagery data from publicly available BCI Competition datasets demonstrate that the proposed computationally efficient method competes closely with filter-bank CSP (FBCSP), and can even outperform the FBCSP if enough training data are available. Furthermore, SCSSP provides us with a simple measure for ranking the discriminant power of extracted spatio-spectral features, which is not possible in FBCSP. The matrix-variate Gaussian assumption allows the SCSSP method to jointly process the EEG data in both spatial and spectral domains. As a result, compared to the similar solutions in the literature such as FBCSP, the proposed SCSSP method requires significantly lower computations. The proposed computationally efficient spatio-spectral feature extractor is particularly suitable for applications in which the computational power is limited, such as emerging wearable mobile BCI systems."
26441568,"Individuals with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) that causes tetraplegia are challenged with dramatic sensorimotor deficits. However, certain rehabilitation techniques may significantly enhance their autonomy by restoring reach-to-grasp movements. Among others, evidence of motor imagery (MI) benefits for neurological rehabilitation of upper limb movements is growing. This literature review addresses MI effectiveness during reach-to-grasp rehabilitation after tetraplegia. Among articles from MEDLINE published between 1966 and 2015, we selected ten studies including 34 participants with C4 to C7 tetraplegia and 22 healthy controls published during the last 15 years. We found that MI of possible non-paralyzed movements improved reach-to-grasp performance by: (i) increasing both tenodesis grasp capabilities and muscle strength; (ii) decreasing movement time (MT), and trajectory variability; and (iii) reducing the abnormally increased brain activity. MI can also strengthen motor commands by potentiating recruitment and synchronization of motoneurons, which leads to improved recovery. These improvements reflect brain adaptations induced by MI. Furthermore, MI can be used to control brain-computer interfaces (BCI) that successfully restore grasp capabilities. These results highlight the growing interest for MI and its potential to recover functional grasping in individuals with tetraplegia, and motivate the need for further studies to substantiate it. "
26410210,"In brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), electrical brain signals during motor imagery are utilized as commands connecting the brain to a computer. To use BCI in patients with stroke, unique brain signal changes should be characterized during motor imagery process. This study aimed to examine the trial-dependent motor-imagery-related activities in stroke patients. During the recording of electroencephalography (EEG) signals, 12 chronic stroke patients and 11 age-matched healthy controls performed motor imagery finger tapping at 1.3 sec intervals. Trial-dependent brain signal changes were assessed by analysis of the mu and beta bands. Neuronal activity in healthy controls was observed over bilateral hemispheres at the mu and beta bands regardless of changes in the trials, whereas neuronal activity in stroke patients was mainly seen over the ipsilesional hemisphere at the beta band. With progression to repeated trials, healthy controls displayed a decrease in cortical activity in the contralateral hemisphere at the mu band and in bilateral hemispheres at the beta band. In contrast, stroke patients showed a decreasing trend in cortical activity only over the ipsilesional hemisphere at the beta band. Trial-dependent changes during motor imagery learning presented in a different manner in stroke patients. Understanding motor imagery learning in stroke patients is crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of motor-imagery-based BCIs."
26405916,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) enables people suffering from affective neurological diseases to communicate with the external world. Common spatial pattern (CSP) is an effective algorithm for feature extraction in motor imagery based BCI systems. However, many studies have proved that the performance of CSP depends heavily on the frequency band of EEG signals used for the construction of covariance matrices. The use of different frequency bands to extract signal features may lead to different classification performances, which are determined by the discriminative and complementary information they contain. In this study, the broad frequency band (8-30 Hz) is divided into 10 sub-bands of band width 4 Hz and overlapping 2 Hz. Binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) is used to find the best sub-band set to improve the performance of CSP and subsequent classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved an average improvement of 6.91% in cross-validation accuracy when compared to broad band CSP. "
26405870,"Motor imagery EEG-based BCI has advantages in the assistance of human control of peripheral devices, such as the mobile robot or wheelchair, because the subject is not exposed to any stimulation and suffers no risk of fatigue. However, the intensive training necessary to recognize the numerous classes of data makes it hard to control these nonholonomic mobile systems accurately and effectively. This paper proposes a new approach which combines motor imagery EEG with the Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System. This approach fuses the intelligence of humans based on motor imagery EEG with the precise capabilities of a mobile system based on ANFIS. This approach realizes a multi-level control, which makes the nonholonomic mobile system highly controllably without stopping or relying on sensor information. Also, because the ANFIS controller can be trained while performing the control task, control accuracy and efficiency is increased for the user. Experimental results of the nonholonomic mobile robot verify the effectiveness of this approach. "
26382749,"When the sensory-motor integration system is malfunctioning provokes a wide variety of neurological disorders, which in many cases cannot be treated with conventional medication, or via existing therapeutic technology. A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a tool that permits to reintegrate the sensory-motor loop, accessing directly to brain information. A potential, promising and quite investigated application of BCI has been in the motor rehabilitation field. It is well-known that motor deficits are the major disability wherewith the worldwide population lives. Therefore, this paper aims to specify the foundation of motor rehabilitation BCIs, as well as to review the recent research conducted so far (specifically, from 2007 to date), in order to evaluate the suitability and reliability of this technology. Although BCI for post-stroke rehabilitation is still in its infancy, the tendency is towards the development of implantable devices that encompass a BCI module plus a stimulation system. "
26378500,"One of the main problems related to electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems is the non-stationarity of the underlying EEG signals. This results in the deterioration of the classification performance during experimental sessions. Therefore, adaptive classification techniques are required for EEG based BCI applications. In this paper, we propose simple adaptive sparse representation based classification (SRC) schemes. Supervised and unsupervised dictionary update techniques for new test data and a dictionary modification method by using the incoherence measure of the training data are investigated. The proposed methods are very simple and additional computation for the re-training of the classifier is not needed. The proposed adaptive SRC schemes are evaluated using two BCI experimental datasets. The proposed methods are assessed by comparing classification results with the conventional SRC and other adaptive classification methods. On the basis of the results, we find that the proposed adaptive schemes show relatively improved classification accuracy as compared to conventional methods without requiring additional computation.

26347642,"A repetitive movement practice by motor imagery (MI) can influence motor cortical excitability in the electroencephalogram (EEG). This study investigated if a realistic visualization in 3D of upper and lower limb movements can amplify motor related potentials during subsequent MI. We hypothesized that a richer sensory visualization might be more effective during instrumental conditioning, resulting in a more pronounced event related desynchronization (ERD) of the upper alpha band (10-12 Hz) over the sensorimotor cortices thereby potentially improving MI based brain-computer interface (BCI) protocols for motor rehabilitation. The results show a strong increase of the characteristic patterns of ERD of the upper alpha band components for left and right limb MI present over the sensorimotor areas in both visualization conditions. Overall, significant differences were observed as a function of visualization modality (VM; 2D vs. 3D). The largest upper alpha band power decrease was obtained during MI after a 3-dimensional visualization. In total in 12 out of 20 tasks the end-user of the 3D visualization group showed an enhanced upper alpha ERD relative to 2D VM group, with statistical significance in nine tasks.With a realistic visualization of the limb movements, we tried to increase motor cortex activation during subsequent MI. The feedback and the feedback environment should be inherently motivating and relevant for the learner and should have an appeal of novelty, real-world relevance or aesthetic value (Ryan and Deci, 2000; Merrill, 2007). Realistic visual feedback, consistent with the participant's MI, might be helpful for accomplishing successful MI and the use of such feedback may assist in making BCI a more natural interface for MI based BCI rehabilitation.

26340647,"Motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow disabled individuals to control external devices voluntarily, helping us to restore lost motor functions. However, the number of control commands available in MI-based BCIs remains limited, limiting the usability of BCI systems in control applications involving multiple degrees of freedom (DOF), such as control of a robot arm. To address this problem, we developed a novel Morse code-inspired method for MI-based BCI design to increase the number of output commands. Using this method, brain activities are modulated by sequences of MI (sMI) tasks, which are constructed by alternately imagining movements of the left or right hand or no motion. The codes of the sMI task was detected from EEG signals and mapped to special commands. According to permutation theory, an sMI task with N-length allows 2 × (2(N)-1) possible commands with the left and right MI tasks under self-paced conditions. To verify its feasibility, the new method was used to construct a six-class BCI system to control the arm of a humanoid robot. Four subjects participated in our experiment and the averaged accuracy of the six-class sMI tasks was 89.4%. The Cohen's kappa coefficient and the throughput of our BCI paradigm are 0.88 ± 0.060 and 23.5bits per minute (bpm), respectively. Furthermore, all of the subjects could operate an actual three-joint robot arm to grasp an object in around 49.1s using our approach. These promising results suggest that the Morse code-inspired method could be used in the design of BCIs for multi-DOF control."
26303933,"For the translation of noninvasive motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) from the lab environment to end users at their homes, their handling must be improved. As a key component, the number of electroencephalogram (EEG)-recording electrodes has to be kept at a minimum. However, due to inter-individual anatomical and physiological variations, reducing the number of electrodes bares the risk of electrode misplacement, which will directly translate into a limited BCI performance of end users. The aim of the study is to evaluate the use of focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as an easy tool to individually optimize electrode positioning for a MI-based BCI. For this, the area of MI-induced mu-rhythm modulation was compared with the motor hand representation area in respect to their localization and to the control performance of a MI-based BCI. Focal TMS was applied to map the motor hand areas and a 48-channel high-resolution EEG was used to localize MI-induced mu-rhythm modulations in 11 able-bodied, right-handed subjects (5 male, age: 23-31). The online BCI performances of the study participants were assessed with a single next-neighbor Laplace channel consecutively placed over the motor hand area and over the area of the strongest mu-modulation. For most subjects, a consistent deviation between the position of the mu-modulation center and the corresponding motor hand areas well above the localization error could be observed in mediolateral and to a lesser degree in anterior-posterior direction. On an individual level, the MI-induced mu-rhythm modulation was at average found 1.6 cm (standard deviation (SD) = 1.30 cm) lateral and 0.31 cm anterior (SD = 1.39 cm) to the motor hand area and enabled a significantly better online BCI performance than the motor hand areas. On an individual level a trend towards a consistent average spatial distance between motor hand area and mu-rhythm modulation center was found indicating that TMS may be used as a simple tool for quick individual optimization of EEG-recording electrode positions of MI-based BCIs. The study results indicate that motor hand areas of the primary motor cortex determined by TMS are not the main generators of the cortical mu-rhythm."
26302519,"Studies have shown that a motor imagery electro encephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system can be used as a rehabilitation tool for stroke patients. Efficient classification of EEG from stroke patients is fundamental in the BCI-based stroke rehabilitation systems. One of the most successful algorithms for EEG classification is the common spatial patterns (CSP). However, studies have reported that the performance of CSP heavily relies on its operational frequency band and channels configuration. To the best of our knowledge, there is no agreed upon clinical conclusion about motor imagery patterns of stroke patients. In this case, it is not available to obtain the active channels and frequency bands related to brain activities of stroke patients beforehand. Hence, for using the CSP algorithm, we usually set a relatively broad frequency range and channels, or try to find subject-related frequency bands and channels. To address this problem, we propose an adaptive boosting algorithm to perform autonomous selection of key channels and frequency band. In the proposed method, the spatial-spectral configurations are divided into multiple preconditions, and a new heuristic supervisor of stochastic gradient boost strategy is utilized to train weak classifiers under these preconditions. Extensive experiment comparisons have been performed on three datasets including two benchmark datasets from the famous BCI competition III and BCI competition IV as well as one self-acquired dataset from stroke patients. Results show that our algorithm yields relatively higher classification accuracies compared with seven state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, the spatial patterns (spatial weights) and spectral patterns (bandpass filters) determined by the algorithm can also be used for further analysis of the data, e.g., for brain source localization and physiological knowledge exploration.

26290661,"We study the relationship between electroencephalographic (EEG) coherence and accuracy in operating a brain-computer interface (BCI). In our case, the BCI is controlled through motor imagery. Hence, a number of volunteers were trained using different training paradigms: classical visual feedback, auditory stimulation, and functional electrical stimulation (FES). After each training session, the volunteers' accuracy in operating the BCI was assessed, and the event-related coherence (ErCoh) was calculated for all possible combinations of pairs of EEG sensors. After at least four training sessions, we searched for significant differences in accuracy and ErCoh using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple comparison tests. Our results show that there exists a high correlation between an increase in ErCoh and performance improvement, and this effect is mainly localized in the centrofrontal and centroparietal brain regions for the case of our motor imagery task. This result has a direct implication with the development of new techniques to evaluate BCI performance and the process of selecting a feedback modality that better enhances the volunteer's capacity to operate a BCI system.

26277421,"Common spatial pattern (CSP) has been most popularly applied to motor-imagery (MI) feature extraction for classification in brain-computer interface (BCI) application. Successful application of CSP depends on the filter band selection to a large degree. However, the most proper band is typically subject-specific and can hardly be determined manually. This study proposes a sparse filter band common spatial pattern (SFBCSP) for optimizing the spatial patterns. SFBCSP estimates CSP features on multiple signals that are filtered from raw EEG data at a set of overlapping bands. The filter bands that result in significant CSP features are then selected in a supervised way by exploiting sparse regression. A support vector machine (SVM) is implemented on the selected features for MI classification. Two public EEG datasets (BCI Competition III dataset IVa and BCI Competition IV IIb) are used to validate the proposed SFBCSP method. Experimental results demonstrate that SFBCSP help improve the classification performance of MI. The optimized spatial patterns by SFBCSP give overall better MI classification accuracy in comparison with several competing methods. The proposed SFBCSP is a potential method for improving the performance of MI-based BCI."
26276986,"Sensorimotor-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have achieved successful control of real and virtual devices in up to three dimensions; however, the traditional sensor-based paradigm limits the intuitive use of these systems. Many control signals for state-of-the-art BCIs involve imagining the movement of body parts that have little to do with the output command, revealing a cognitive disconnection between the user's intent and the action of the end effector. Therefore, there is a need to develop techniques that can identify with high spatial resolution the self-modulated neural activity reflective of the actions of a helpful output device. We extend previous EEG source imaging (ESI) work to decoding natural hand/wrist manipulations by applying a novel technique to classifying four complex motor imaginations of the right hand: flexion, extension, supination, and pronation. We report an increase of up to 18.6% for individual task classification and 12.7% for overall classification using the proposed ESI approach over the traditional sensor-based method. ESI is able to enhance BCI performance of decoding complex right-hand motor imagery tasks. This study may lead to the development of BCI systems with naturalistic and intuitive motor imaginations, thus facilitating broad use of noninvasive BCIs."
26259213,"This work aimed to find and evaluate a new method for detecting errors in continuous brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Instead of classifying errors on a single-trial basis, the new method was based on multiple events (MEs) analysis to increase the accuracy of error detection. In a BCI-driven car game, based on motor imagery (MI), discrete events were triggered whenever subjects collided with coins and/or barriers. Coins counted as correct events, whereas barriers were errors. This new method, termed ME method, combined and averaged the classification results of single events (SEs) and determined the correctness of MI trials, which consisted of event sequences instead of SEs. The benefit of this method was evaluated in an offline simulation. In an online experiment, the new method was used to detect erroneous MI trials. Such MI trials were discarded and could be repeated by the users. We found that, even with low SE error potential (ErrP) detection rates, feasible accuracies can be achieved when combining MEs to distinguish erroneous from correct MI trials. Online, all subjects reached higher scores with error detection than without, at the cost of longer times needed for completing the game. Findings suggest that ErrP detection may become a reliable tool for monitoring continuous states in BCI applications when combining MEs. This paper demonstrates a novel technique for detecting errors in online continuous BCI applications, which yields promising results even with low single-trial detection rates."
26236207,"The mechanisms of learning involved in brain self-regulation have still to be unveiled to exploit the full potential of this methodology for therapeutic interventions. This skill of volitionally changing brain activity presumably resembles motor skill learning which in turn is accompanied by plastic changes modulating resting state networks. Along these lines, we hypothesized that brain regulation and neurofeedback would similarly modify intrinsic networks at rest while presenting a distinct spatio-temporal pattern. High-resolution electroencephalography preceded and followed a single neurofeedback training intervention of modulating circumscribed sensorimotor low β-activity by kinesthetic motor imagery in eleven healthy participants. The participants were kept in the deliberative phase of skill acquisition with high demands for learning self-regulation through stepwise increases of task difficulty. By applying the corrected imaginary part of the coherency function, we observed increased functional connectivity of both the primary motor and the primary somatosensory cortex with their respective contralateral homologous cortices in the low β-frequency band which was self-regulated during feedback. At the same time, the primary motor cortex-but none of the surrounding cortical areas-showed connectivity to contralateral supplementary motor and dorsal premotor areas in the high β-band. Simultaneously, the neurofeedback target displayed a specific increase of functional connectivity with an ipsilateral fronto-parietal network in the α-band while presenting a de-coupling with contralateral primary and secondary sensorimotor areas in the very same frequency band. Brain self-regulation modifies resting state connections spatially selective to the neurofeedback target of the dominant hemisphere. These are anatomically distinct with regard to the cortico-cortical connectivity pattern and are functionally specific with regard to the time domain of coherent activity consistent with a Hebbian-like sharpening concept.

26217298,"In the present multiple case study, we examined hemodynamic changes in the brain in response to motor execution (ME) and motor imagery (MI) of swallowing in dysphagia patients compared to healthy matched controls using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Two stroke patients with cerebral lesions in the right hemisphere, two stroke patients with lesions in the brainstem, and two neurologically healthy control subjects actively swallowed saliva (ME) and mentally imagined to swallow saliva (MI) in a randomized order while changes in concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) were assessed. In line with recent findings in healthy young adults, MI and ME of swallowing led to the strongest NIRS signal change in the inferior frontal gyrus in stroke patients as well as in healthy elderly. We found differences in the topographical distribution and time course of the hemodynamic response in dependence on lesion location. Dysphagia patients with lesions in the brainstem showed bilateral hemodynamic signal changes in the inferior frontal gyrus during active swallowing comparable to healthy controls. In contrast, dysphagia patients with cerebral lesions in the right hemisphere showed more unilateral activation patterns during swallowing. Furthermore, patients with cerebral lesions showed a prolonged time course of the hemodynamic response during MI and ME of swallowing compared to healthy controls and patients with brainstem lesions. Brain activation patterns associated with ME and MI of swallowing were largely comparable, especially for changes in deoxy-Hb. Hence, the present results provide new evidence regarding timing and topographical distribution of the hemodynamic response during ME and MI of swallowing in dysphagia patients and may have practical impact on future dysphagia treatment.

26211270,"This paper presents a feature extraction method based on multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) combining with the power spectrum feature, and the method aims at the non-stationary electroencephalogram (EEG) or magnetoencephalogram (MEG) signal in brain-computer interface (BCI) system. Firstly, we utilized MEMD algorithm to decompose multichannel brain signals into a series of multiple intrinsic mode function (IMF), which was proximate stationary and with multi-scale. Then we extracted and reduced the power characteristic from each IMF to a lower dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, we classified the motor imagery tasks by linear discriminant analysis classifier. The experimental verification showed that the correct recognition rates of the two-class and four-class tasks of the BCI competition III and competition IV reached 92.0% and 46.2%, respectively, which were superior to the winner of the BCI competition. The experimental proved that the proposed method was reasonably effective and stable and it would provide a new way for feature extraction."
26190995,"Neurofeedback training of Motor imagery (MI)-related brain-states with brain-computer/brain-machine interfaces (BCI/BMI) is currently being explored as an experimental intervention prior to standard physiotherapy to improve the motor outcome of stroke rehabilitation. The use of BCI/BMI technology increases the adherence to MI training more efficiently than interventions with sham or no feedback. Moreover, pilot studies suggest that such a priming intervention before physiotherapy might-like some brain stimulation techniques-increase the responsiveness of the brain to the subsequent physiotherapy, thereby improving the general clinical outcome. However, there is little evidence up to now that these BCI/BMI-based interventions have achieved operate conditioning of specific brain states that facilitate task-specific functional gains beyond the practice of primed physiotherapy. In this context, we argue that BCI/BMI technology provides a valuable neurofeedback tool for rehabilitation but needs to aim at physiological features relevant for the targeted behavioral gain. Moreover, this therapeutic intervention has to be informed by concepts of reinforcement learning to develop its full potential. Such a refined neurofeedback approach would need to address the following issues: (1) Defining a physiological feedback target specific to the intended behavioral gain, e.g., β-band oscillations for cortico-muscular communication. This targeted brain state could well be different from the brain state optimal for the neurofeedback task, e.g., α-band oscillations for differentiating MI from rest; (2) Selecting a BCI/BMI classification and thresholding approach on the basis of learning principles, i.e., balancing challenge and reward of the neurofeedback task instead of maximizing the classification accuracy of the difficulty level device; and (3) Adjusting the difficulty level in the course of the training period to account for the cognitive load and the learning experience of the participant. Here, we propose a comprehensive neurofeedback strategy for motor restoration after stroke that addresses these aspects, and provide evidence for the feasibility of the suggested approach by demonstrating that dynamic threshold adaptation based on reinforcement learning may lead to frequency-specific operant conditioning of β-band oscillations paralleled by task-specific motor improvement; a proposal that requires investigation in a larger cohort of stroke patients.

26183126,"This paper presents an evaluation of the continuous detection of mental calculation episodes, which may be useful for users who strive to operate current BCI paradigms or even for augmenting degrees of freedom. The experimentation consisted in the alternated realization of basic arithmetic mental calculations and resting periods. EEG data were analyzed using sliding windows of 2s length. The experimental population was comprised of fifteen healthy subjects who participated in three sessions on different days. The features used for the classification process were the power spectral density over the beta band ([14-35] Hz) and the scaling exponent obtained via detrended fluctuation analysis. Both indices were estimated over four channels, specifically selected for each subject. The performance was evaluated using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) by measuring the overall classification performance of each experimental session with a cross-validation procedure, and by transferring the model obtained from one session to the others called inter Session Validation (iSV). The best AUC values computed in each cross-validation session were: 0.87±0.067, 0.89±0.056 and 0.88±0.040 respectively; and the iSV provided a value of 0.67±0.122. These high values indicate that a mental calculation paradigm and a combination of features can efficiently control a BCI system. Notwithstanding that several days passed between sessions, the AUC mean value estimated for the iSV is similar to the performance of a motor imagery-BCI calibrated on the same day. "
26170164,"Novel rehabilitation strategies apply robot-assisted exercises and neurofeedback tasks to facilitate intensive motor training. We aimed to disentangle task-specific and subject-related contributions to the perceived workload of these interventions and the related cortical activation patterns. We assessed the perceived workload with the NASA Task Load Index in twenty-one subjects who were exposed to two different feedback tasks in a cross-over design: (i) brain-robot interface (BRI) with haptic/proprioceptive feedback of sensorimotor oscillations related to motor imagery, and (ii) control of neuromuscular activity with feedback of the electromyography (EMG) of the same hand. We also used electroencephalography to examine the cortical activation patterns beforehand in resting state and during the training session of each task. The workload profile of BRI feedback differed from EMG feedback and was particularly characterized by the experience of frustration. The frustration level was highly correlated across tasks, suggesting subject-related relevance of this workload component. Those subjects who were specifically challenged by the respective tasks could be detected by an interhemispheric alpha-band network in resting state before the training and by their sensorimotor theta-band activation pattern during the exercise. Neurophysiological profiles in resting state and during the exercise may provide task-independent workload markers for monitoring and matching participants' ability and task difficulty of neurofeedback interventions."
26138148,"This study investigated the effect of multimodal (visual and auditory) continuous feedback with information about the uncertainty of the input signal on motor imagery based BCI performance. A liquid floating through a visualization of a funnel (funnel feedback) provided enriched visual or enriched multimodal feedback. In a between subject design 30 healthy SMR-BCI naive participants were provided with either conventional bar feedback (CB), or visual funnel feedback (UF), or multimodal (visual and auditory) funnel feedback (MF). Subjects were required to imagine left and right hand movement and were trained to control the SMR based BCI for five sessions on separate days. Feedback accuracy varied largely between participants. The MF feedback lead to a significantly better performance in session 1 as compared to the CB feedback and could significantly enhance motivation and minimize frustration in BCI use across the five training sessions. The present study demonstrates that the BCI funnel feedback allows participants to modulate sensorimotor EEG rhythms. Participants were able to control the BCI with the funnel feedback with better performance during the initial session and less frustration compared to the CB feedback. The multimodal funnel feedback provides an alternative to the conventional cursorbar feedback for training subjects to modulate their sensorimotor rhythms."
26115603,"Acting efficiently in the world depends on the activity of motor and somatosensory systems, the integration of which is necessary for the proper functioning of the sensorimotor loop (SL). Profound alterations of SL functioning follow spinal cord injury (SCI), a condition that brings about a disconnection of the body from the brain. Such disconnection creates a substantial deprivation of somatosensorial inputs and motor outputs. Consequent somatic deficits and motor paralysis affect the body below the lesion level. A complete restoration of normal functions of the SL cannot be expected until basic neuroscience has found a way to re-establish the interrupted neural connectivity. Meanwhile, studies should focus on the development of technical solutions for dealing with the disruption of the sensorimotor loop. This review discusses the structural and functional adaptive reorganization of the brain after SCI, and the maladaptive mechanisms that impact on the processing of body related information, which alter motor imagery strategies and EEG signals. Studies that show how residual functions (e.g. face tactile sensitivity) may help people to restore a normal body image are also reviewed. Finally, data on how brain and residual body signals may be used to improve brain computer interface systems is discussed in relation to the issue of how such systems may help SCI people to re-enter the world and interact with objects and other individuals.

26099149,"In this paper we first point out a fatal drawback that the widely used Granger causality (GC) needs to estimate the autoregressive model, which is equivalent to taking a series of backward recursive operations which are infeasible in many irreversible chemical reaction models. Thus, new causality (NC) proposed by Hu et al. (2011) is theoretically shown to be more sensitive to reveal true causality than GC. We then apply GC and NC to motor imagery (MI) which is an important mental process in cognitive neuroscience and psychology and has received growing attention for a long time. We study causality flow during MI using scalp electroencephalograms from nine subjects in Brain-computer interface competition IV held in 2008. We are interested in three regions: Cz (central area of the cerebral cortex), C3 (left area of the cerebral cortex), and C4 (right area of the cerebral cortex) which are considered to be optimal locations for recognizing MI states in the literature. Our results show that: 1) there is strong directional connectivity from Cz to C3/C4 during left- and right-hand MIs based on GC and NC; 2) during left-hand MI, there is directional connectivity from C4 to C3 based on GC and NC; 3) during right-hand MI, there is strong directional connectivity from C3 to C4 which is much clearly revealed by NC than by GC, i.e., NC largely improves the classification rate; and 4) NC is demonstrated to be much more sensitive to reveal causal influence between different brain regions than GC."
26093326,"Understanding how the brain processes errors is an essential and active field of neuroscience. Real time extraction and analysis of error signals provide an innovative method of assessing how individuals perceive ongoing interactions without recourse to overt behaviour. This area of research is critical in modern Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) design, but may also open fruitful perspectives in cognitive neuroscience research. In this context, we sought to determine whether we can extract discriminatory error-related activity in the source space, online, and on a trial by trial basis from electroencephalography data recorded during motor imagery. Using a data driven approach, based on interpretable inverse solution algorithms, we assessed the extent to which automatically extracted error-related activity was physiologically and functionally interpretable according to performance monitoring literature. The applicability of inverse solution based methods for automatically extracting error signals, in the presence of noise generated by motor imagery, was validated by simulation. Representative regions of interest, outlining the primary generators contributing to classification, were found to correspond closely to networks involved in error detection and performance monitoring. We observed discriminative activity in non-frontal areas, demonstrating that areas outside of the medial frontal cortex can contribute to the classification of error feedback activity. "
26083480,"Two-dimensional (2D) movement control is an important issue in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) research because being able to move, for example, a cursor with the brain will enable patients with motor disabilities to control their environment. However, it is still a challenge to continuously control 2D movement with a non-invasive BCI system. In this paper, we developed a 2D cursor control with motor imagery BCI tasks allowing users to move a cursor to any position by using a combination strategy. With this strategy, a user can combine multiple motor imagery tasks, alternatively or simultaneously, to control 2D movements. After a training session, six participants took part in the first control strategy experiment (the center-out experiment) to verify the effectiveness of the cursor control. Three of the six participants performed an additional experiment, in which they were required to move the cursor to hit five targets in a given sequence. The average hit rate was more than [Formula: see text] and the trajectories were close to the shortest path. The average hit rate was more than 95.6% and the trajectories were close to the shortest path in the center-out experiment. In the additional experiment, three participants achieved a 100% hit rate with a short trajectory. The results demonstrated that users were able to effectively control the 2D movement using the proposed strategy. The present system may be used as a tool to interact with the external world."
26054072,"The concept of controlling a wheelchair using brain signals is promising. However, the continuous control of a wheelchair based on unstable and noisy electroencephalogram signals is unreliable and generates a significant mental burden for the user. A feasible solution is to integrate a brain-computer interface (BCI) with automated navigation techniques. This paper presents a brain-controlled intelligent wheelchair with the capability of automatic navigation. Using an autonomous navigation system, candidate destinations and waypoints are automatically generated based on the existing environment. The user selects a destination using a motor imagery (MI)-based or P300-based BCI. According to the determined destination, the navigation system plans a short and safe path and navigates the wheelchair to the destination. During the movement of the wheelchair, the user can issue a stop command with the BCI. Using our system, the mental burden of the user can be substantially alleviated. Furthermore, our system can adapt to changes in the environment. Two experiments based on MI and P300 were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. "

We review the principles and approaches we have taken to develop a sensorimotor rhythm EEG based brain-computer interface (BCI). The methods include developing BCI systems incorporating the control of physical devices to increase user engagement, improving BCI systems by inversely mapping scalp-recorded EEG signals to the cortical source domain, integrating BCI with noninvasive neuromodulation strategies to improve learning, and incorporating mind-body awareness training to enhance BCI learning and performance. The challenges and merits of these strategies are discussed, together with recent findings. Our work indicates that the sensorimotor-rhythm-based noninvasive BCI has the potential to provide communication and control capabilities as an alternative to physiological motor pathways."
25999506,"Nonhuman primate and human studies have suggested that populations of neurons in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) may represent high-level aspects of action planning that can be used to control external devices as part of a brain-machine interface. However, there is no direct neuron-recording evidence that human PPC is involved in action planning, and the suitability of these signals for neuroprosthetic control has not been tested. We recorded neural population activity with arrays of microelectrodes implanted in the PPC of a tetraplegic subject. Motor imagery could be decoded from these neural populations, including imagined goals, trajectories, and types of movement. These findings indicate that the PPC of humans represents high-level, cognitive aspects of action and that the PPC can be a rich source for cognitive control signals for neural prosthetics that assist paralyzed patients.

25992718,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) translate oscillatory electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns into action. Different mental activities modulate spontaneous EEG rhythms in various ways. Non-stationarity and inherent variability of EEG signals, however, make reliable recognition of modulated EEG patterns challenging. Able-bodied individuals who use a BCI for the first time achieve - on average - binary classification performance of about 75%. Performance in users with central nervous system (CNS) tissue damage is typically lower. User training generally enhances reliability of EEG pattern generation and thus also robustness of pattern recognition. In this study, we investigated the impact of mental tasks on binary classification performance in BCI users with central nervous system (CNS) tissue damage such as persons with stroke or spinal cord injury (SCI). Motor imagery (MI), that is the kinesthetic imagination of movement (e.g. squeezing a rubber ball with the right hand), is the ""gold standard"" and mainly used to modulate EEG patterns. Based on our recent results in able-bodied users, we hypothesized that pair-wise combination of ""brain-teaser"" (e.g. mental subtraction and mental word association) and ""dynamic imagery"" (e.g. hand and feet MI) tasks significantly increases classification performance of induced EEG patterns in the selected end-user group. Within-day (How stable is the classification within a day?) and between-day (How well does a model trained on day one perform on unseen data of day two?) analysis of variability of mental task pair classification in nine individuals confirmed the hypothesis. We found that the use of the classical MI task pair hand vs. feed leads to significantly lower classification accuracy - in average up to 15% less - in most users with stroke or SCI. User-specific selection of task pairs was again essential to enhance performance. We expect that the gained evidence will significantly contribute to make imagery-based BCI technology become accessible to a larger population of users including individuals with special needs due to CNS damage.

25986750,"Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) training has been proved to be an effective communication system between human brain and external devices. A practical problem in BCI-based systems is how to correctly and efficiently identify and extract subject-specific features from the blurred scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and translate those features into device commands in order to control external devices. In real BCI-based applications, we usually define frequency bands and channels configuration that related to brain activities beforehand. However, a steady configuration usually loses effects due to individual variability among different subjects in practical applications. In this study, a robust tensor-based method is proposed for a multiway discriminative subspace extraction from tensor-represented EEG data, which performs well in motor imagery EEG classification without the prior neurophysiologic knowledge like channels configuration and active frequency bands. Motor imagery EEG patterns in spatial-spectral-temporal domain are detected directly from the multidimensional EEG, which may provide insights to the underlying cortical activity patterns. Extensive experiment comparisons have been performed on a benchmark dataset from the famous BCI competition III as well as self-acquired data from healthy subjects and stroke patients. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over the contemporary methods. "
25979668,"The mental practice of movements has been suggested as a promising add-on therapy to facilitate motor recovery after stroke. In the case of mentally practised movements, electroencephalogram (EEG) can be utilized to provide feedback about an otherwise covert act. The main target group for such an intervention are elderly patients, though research so far is largely focused on young populations (<30 years). The present study therefore aimed to examine the influence of age on the neural correlates of covert movements (CMs) in a real-time EEG neurofeedback framework. CM-induced event-related desynchronization (ERD) was studied in young (mean age: 23.6 years) and elderly (mean age: 62.7 years) healthy adults. Participants performed covert and overt hand movements. CMs were based on kinesthetic motor imagery (MI) or quasi-movements (QM). Based on previous studies investigating QM in the mu frequency range (8-13Hz) QM were expected to result in more lateralized ERD% patterns and accordingly higher classification accuracies. Independent of CM strategy the elderly were characterized by a significantly reduced lateralization of ERD%, due to stronger ipsilateral ERD%, and in consequence, reduced classification accuracies. QM were generally perceived as more vivid, but no differences were evident between MI and QM in ERD% or classification accuracies. EEG feedback enhanced task-related activity independently of strategy and age. ERD% measures of overt and covert movements were strongly related in young adults, whereas in the elderly ERD% lateralization is dissociated. In summary, we did not find evidence in support of more pronounced ERD% lateralization patterns in QM. Our finding of a less lateralized activation pattern in the elderly is in accordance to previous research and with the idea that compensatory processes help to overcome neurodegenerative changes related to normal ageing. Importantly, it indicates that EEG neurofeedback studies should place more emphasis on the age of the potential end-users."
25977685,"This paper presents an investigation aimed at drastically reducing the processing burden required by motor imagery brain-computer interface (BCI) systems based on electroencephalography (EEG). In this research, the focus has moved from the channel to the feature paradigm, and a 96% reduction of the number of features required in the process has been achieved maintaining and even improving the classification success rate. This way, it is possible to build cheaper, quicker, and more portable BCI systems. The data set used was provided within the framework of BCI Competition III, which allows it to compare the presented results with the classification accuracy achieved in the contest. Furthermore, a new three-step methodology has been developed which includes a feature discriminant character calculation stage; a score, order, and selection phase; and a final feature selection step. For the first stage, both statistics method and fuzzy criteria are used. The fuzzy criteria are based on the S-dFasArt classification algorithm which has shown excellent performance in previous papers undertaking the BCI multiclass motor imagery problem. The score, order, and selection stage is used to sort the features according to their discriminant nature. Finally, both order selection and Group Method Data Handling (GMDH) approaches are used to choose the most discriminant ones. "
25972896,"Transferring the brain computer interface (BCI) from laboratory condition to meet the real world application needs BCI to be applied asynchronously without any time constraint. High level of dynamism in the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal reasons us to look toward evolutionary algorithm (EA). Motivated by these two facts, in this work a hybrid GA-PSO based K-means clustering technique has been used to distinguish two class motor imagery (MI) tasks. The proposed hybrid GA-PSO based K-means clustering is found to outperform genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) based K-means clustering techniques in terms of both accuracy and execution time. The lesser execution time of hybrid GA-PSO technique makes it suitable for real time BCI application. Time frequency representation (TFR) techniques have been used to extract the feature of the signal under investigation. TFRs based features are extracted and relying on the concept of event related synchronization (ERD) and desynchronization (ERD) feature vector is formed. "
25933101,"In this study, a novel spatial filter design method is introduced. Spatial filtering is an important processing step for feature extraction in motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces. This paper introduces a new motor imagery signal classification method combined with spatial filter optimization. We simultaneously train the spatial filter and the classifier using a neural network approach. The proposed spatial filter network (SFN) is composed of two layers: a spatial filtering layer and a classifier layer. These two layers are linked to each other with non-linear mapping functions. The proposed method addresses two shortcomings of the common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm. First, CSP aims to maximize the between-classes variance while ignoring the minimization of within-classes variances. Consequently, the features obtained using the CSP method may have large within-classes variances. Second, the maximizing optimization function of CSP increases the classification accuracy indirectly because an independent classifier is used after the CSP method. With SFN, we aimed to maximize the between-classes variance while minimizing within-classes variances and simultaneously optimizing the spatial filter and the classifier. To classify motor imagery EEG signals, we modified the well-known feed-forward structure and derived forward and backward equations that correspond to the proposed structure. We tested our algorithm on simple toy data. Then, we compared the SFN with conventional CSP and its multi-class version, called one-versus-rest CSP, on two data sets from BCI competition III. The evaluation results demonstrate that SFN is a good alternative for classifying motor imagery EEG signals with increased classification accuracy. "
25909828,"Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) is a widely used spatial filtering technique for electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI). It is a two-class supervised technique that needs subject-specific training data. Due to EEG nonstationarity, EEG signal may exhibit significant intra- and inter-subject variation. As a result, spatial filters learned from a subject may not perform well for data acquired from the same subject at a different time or from other subjects performing the same task. Studies have been performed to improve CSP's performance by adding regularization terms into the training. Most of them require target subjects' training data with known class labels. In this work, an adaptive CSP (ACSP) method is proposed to analyze single trial EEG data from single and multiple subjects. The method does not estimate target data's class labels during the adaptive learning and updates spatial filters for both classes simultaneously. The proposed method was evaluated based on a comparison study with the classic CSP and several CSP-based adaptive methods using motor imagery EEG data from BCI competitions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can improve the classification performance as compared to the other methods. For circumstances where true class labels of target data are not instantly available, it was examined if adding classified target data to training data would improve the ACSP learning. Experimental results show that it would be better to exclude them from the training data. The proposed ACSP method can be performed in real-time and is potentially applicable to various EEG-based BCI applications."
25887263,"Motor imagery (MI) combined with real-time electroencephalogram (EEG) feedback is a popular approach for steering brain-computer interfaces (BCI). MI BCI has been considered promising as add-on therapy to support motor recovery after stroke. Yet whether EEG neurofeedback indeed targets specific sensorimotor activation patterns cannot be unambiguously inferred from EEG alone. We combined MI EEG neurofeedback with concurrent and continuous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize the relationship between MI EEG neurofeedback and activation in cortical sensorimotor areas. EEG signals were corrected online from interfering MRI gradient and ballistocardiogram artifacts, enabling the delivery of real-time EEG feedback. Significantly enhanced task-specific brain activity during feedback compared to no feedback blocks was present in EEG and fMRI. Moreover, the contralateral MI related decrease in EEG sensorimotor rhythm amplitude correlated inversely with fMRI activation in the contralateral sensorimotor areas, whereas a lateralized fMRI pattern did not necessarily go along with a lateralized EEG pattern. Together, the findings indicate a complex relationship between MI EEG signals and sensorimotor cortical activity, whereby both are similarly modulated by EEG neurofeedback. This finding supports the potential of MI EEG neurofeedback for motor rehabilitation and helps to better understand individual differences in MI BCI performance. "
25868229,"In the present investigation, we studied four methods of blind source separation/independent component analysis (BSS/ICA), AMUSE, SOBI, JADE, and FastICA. We did the feature extraction of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of brain computer interface (BCI) for classifying spontaneous mental activities, which contained four mental tasks including imagination of left hand, right hand, foot and tongue movement. Different methods of extract physiological components were studied and achieved good performance. Then, three combined methods of SOBI and FastICA for extraction of EEG features of motor imagery were proposed. The results showed that combining of SOBI and ICA could not only reduce various artifacts and noise but also localize useful source and improve accuracy of BCI. It would improve further study of physiological mechanisms of motor imagery."
25845481,"Brain activities could be measured by devices like EEG, MEG, MRI etc. in terms of electric or magnetic signal, which could provide information from three domains, i.e., time, frequency and space. Combinatory analysis of these features could definitely help to improve the classification performance on brain activities. NMF (nonnegative matrix factorization) has been widely applied in pattern extraction tasks (e.g., face recognition, gene data analysis) which could provide physically meaningful explanation of the data. However, brain signals also take negative values, so only spectral feature has been employed in existing NMF studies for brain computer interface. In addition, sparsity is an intrinsic characteristic of electric signals. To incorporate sparsity constraint and enable analysis of time domain feature using NMF, a new solution for motor imagery classification is developed, which combinatorially analyzes the ERP (event related potential, time domain) and ERSP (event related spectral perturbation, frequency domain) features via a modified mixed alternating least square based NMF method (MALS-NMF for short). Extensive experiments have verified the effectivity the proposed method. The results also showed that imposing sparsity constraint on the coefficient matrix in ERP factorization and basis matrix in ERSP factorization could better improve the algorithm performance. Comparisons with other eight representative methods have further verified the superiority of the proposed method. The MALS-NMF method is an effective solution for motor imagery classification and has shed some new light into the field of brain dynamics pattern analysis."
25834118,"In order to increase the number of states classified by a brain-computer interface (BCI), we utilized a motor imagery task where subjects imagined both force and speed of hand clenching. The BCI utilized simultaneously recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals. The time-phase-frequency feature was extracted from EEG, whereas the HbD [the difference of oxy-hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb)] feature was used to improve the classification accuracy of fNIRS. The EEG and fNIRS features were combined and optimized using the joint mutual information (JMI) feature selection criterion; then the extracted features were classified with the extreme learning machines (ELMs). In this study, the averaged classification accuracy of EEG signals achieved by the time-phase-frequency feature improved by 7%, to 18%, more than the single-type feature, and improved by 15% more than common spatial pattern (CSP) feature. The HbD feature of fNIRS signals improved the accuracy by 1%, to 4%, more than Hb, HbO, or HbT (total hemoglobin). The EEG-fNIRS feature for decoding motor imagery of both force and speed of hand clenching achieved an accuracy of 89% ± 2%, and improved the accuracy by 1% to 5% more than the sole EEG or fNIRS feature. Our novel motor imagery paradigm improves BCI performance by increasing the number of extracted commands. Both the time-phase-frequency and the HbD feature improve the classification accuracy of EEG and fNIRS signals, respectively, and the hybrid EEG-fNIRS technique achieves a higher decoding accuracy for two-class motor imagery, which may provide the framework for future multi-modal online BCI systems."
25830611,"The task of discriminating the motor imagery of different movements within the same limb using electroencephalography (EEG) signals is challenging because these imaginary movements have close spatial representations on the motor cortex area. There is, however, a pressing need to succeed in this task. The reason is that the ability to classify different same-limb imaginary movements could increase the number of control dimensions of a brain-computer interface (BCI). In this paper, we propose a 3-class BCI system that discriminates EEG signals corresponding to rest, imaginary grasp movements, and imaginary elbow movements. Besides, the differences between simple motor imagery and goal-oriented motor imagery in terms of their topographical distributions and classification accuracies are also being investigated. To the best of our knowledge, both problems have not been explored in the literature. Based on the EEG data recorded from 12 able-bodied individuals, we have demonstrated that same-limb motor imagery classification is possible. For the binary classification of imaginary grasp and elbow (goal-oriented) movements, the average accuracy achieved is 66.9%. For the 3-class problem of discriminating rest against imaginary grasp and elbow movements, the average classification accuracy achieved is 60.7%, which is greater than the random classification accuracy of 33.3%. Our results also show that goal-oriented imaginary elbow movements lead to a better classification performance compared to simple imaginary elbow movements. This proposed BCI system could potentially be used in controlling a robotic rehabilitation system, which can assist stroke patients in performing task-specific exercises. "
25816285,"For individuals with high degrees of motor disability or locked-in syndrome, it is impractical or impossible to use mechanical switches to interact with electronic devices. Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) can use motor imagery to detect interaction intention from users but lack the accuracy of mechanical switches. Hence, there exists a strong need to improve the accuracy of EEG-based motor imagery BCIs attempting to implement an on/off switch. Here, we investigate how monitoring the pupil diameter of a person as a psycho-physiological parameter in addition to traditional EEG channels can improve the classification accuracy of a switch-like BCI. We have recently noticed in our lab (work not yet published) how motor imagery is associated with increases in pupil diameter when compared to a control rest condition. The pupil diameter parameter is easily accessible through video oculography since most gaze tracking systems report pupil diameter invariant to head position. We performed a user study with 30 participants using a typical EEG based motor imagery BCI. We used common spatial patterns to separate motor imagery, signaling movement intention, from a rest control condition. By monitoring the pupil diameter of the user and using this parameter as an additional feature, we show that the performance of the classifier trying to discriminate motor imagery from a control condition improves over the traditional approach using just EEG derived features. Given the limitations of EEG to construct highly robust and reliable BCIs, we postulate that multi-modal approaches, such as the one presented here that monitor several psycho-physiological parameters, can be a successful strategy in making BCIs more accurate and less vulnerable to constraints such as requirements for long training sessions or high signal to noise ratio of electrode channels.

25810484,"Noninvasive brain-computer-interfaces (BCI) coupled with prosthetic devices were recently introduced in the rehabilitation of chronic stroke and other disorders of the motor system. These BCI systems and motor rehabilitation in general involve several motor tasks for training. This study investigates the neurophysiological bases of an EEG-oscillation-driven BCI combined with a neuroprosthetic device to define the specific oscillatory signature of the BCI task. Controlling movements of a hand robotic orthosis with motor imagery of the same movement generates sensorimotor rhythm oscillation changes and involves three elements of tasks also used in stroke motor rehabilitation: passive and active movement, motor imagery, and motor intention. We recorded EEG while nine healthy participants performed five different motor tasks consisting of closing and opening of the hand as follows: 1) motor imagery without any external feedback and without overt hand movement, 2) motor imagery that moves the orthosis proportional to the produced brain oscillation change with online proprioceptive and visual feedback of the hand moving through a neuroprosthetic device (BCI condition), 3) passive and 4) active movement of the hand with feedback (seeing and feeling the hand moving), and 5) rest. During the BCI condition, participants received contingent online feedback of the decrease of power of the sensorimotor rhythm, which induced orthosis movement and therefore proprioceptive and visual information from the moving hand. We analyzed brain activity during the five conditions using time-frequency domain bootstrap-based statistical comparisons and Morlet transforms. Activity during rest was used as a reference. Significant contralateral and ipsilateral event-related desynchronization of sensorimotor rhythm was present during all motor tasks, largest in contralateral-postcentral, medio-central, and ipsilateral-precentral areas identifying the ipsilateral precentral cortex as an integral part of motor regulation. Changes in task-specific frequency power compared with rest were similar between motor tasks, and only significant differences in the time course and some narrow specific frequency bands were observed between motor tasks. We identified EEG features representing active and passive proprioception (with and without muscle contraction) and active intention and passive involvement (with and without voluntary effort) differentiating brain oscillations during motor tasks that could substantially support the design of novel motor BCI-based rehabilitation therapies. The BCI task induced significantly different brain activity compared with the other motor tasks, indicating neural processes unique to the use of body actuators control in a BCI context. "
25800212,"In brain-computer interfacing (BCI), motor imagery is used to provide a gateway to an effector action or behavior. However, in contrast to the main functional role of the primary motor cortex (M1) in motor execution, the M1's involvement in motor imagery has been debated, while the roles of secondary motor areas such as the premotor cortex (PMC) and supplementary motor area (SMA) in motor imagery have been proposed. We examined which motor cortical region had the greatest predictive ability for imagined movement among the primary and secondary motor areas. For two modes of motor performance, executed movement and imagined movement, in 12 healthy subjects who performed two types of motor task, hand grasping and hand rotation, we used the multivariate Bayes method to compare predictive ability between the primary and secondary motor areas (M1, PMC, and SMA) contralateral to the moved hand. With the distributed representation of activation, executed movement was best predicted from the M1 while imagined movement from the SMA, among the three motor cortical regions, in both types of motor task. In addition, the most predictive information about the distinction between executed movement and imagined movement was contained in the M1. The greater predictive ability of the SMA for imagined movement suggests its functional role that could be applied to motor imagery-based BCI."
25788102,"Currently most subjects can control the sensorimotor rhythm-based brain-computer interface (SMR-BCI) successfully after several training procedures. However, 15-30% of subjects cannot achieve SMR-BCI control even after long-term training, and they are termed as ""BCI inefficiency"". This study focuses on the investigation of reliable SMR-BCI performance predictor. 40 subjects participated in the first experimental session and 26 of them returned in the second session, each session consists of an eyes closed/open resting-state EEG recording run and four EEG recording runs with hand motor imagery. We found spectral entropy derived from eyes closed resting-state EEG of channel C3 has a high correlation with SMR-BCI performance (r = 0.65). Thus, we proposed to use it as a biomarker to predict individual SMR-BCI performance. Receiver operating characteristics analysis and leave-one-out cross-validation demonstrated that the spectral entropy predictor provide outstanding classification capability for high and low aptitude BCI users. To our knowledge, there has been no discussion about the reliability of inter-session prediction in previous studies. We further evaluated the inter-session prediction performance of the spectral entropy predictor, and the results showed that the average classification accuracy of inter-session prediction up to 89%. The proposed predictor is convenient to obtain because it derived from single channel resting-state EEG, it could be used to identify potential SMR-BCI inefficiency subjects from novel users. But there are still limitations because Kübler et al. have shown that some BCI users may need eight or more sessions before they develop classifiable SMR activity."
25764703,"The purpose of using brain-computer interface (BCI) is to build a bridge between brain and computer for the disable persons, in order to help them to communicate with the outside world. Electroencephalography (EEG) has low signal to noise ratio (SNR), and there exist some problems in the traditional methods for the feature extraction of EEG, such as low classification accuracy, lack of spatial information and huge amounts of features. To solve these problems, we proposed a new method based on time domain, frequency domain and space domain. In this study, independent component analysis (ICA) and wavelet transform were used to extract the temporal, spectral and spatial features from the original EEG signals, and then the extracted features were classified with the method combined support vector machine (SVM) with genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed method displayed a better classification performance, and made the mean accuracy of the Graz datasets in the BCI Competitions of 2003 reach 96%. The classification results showed that the proposed method with the three domains could effectively overcome the drawbacks of the traditional methods based solely on time-frequency domain when the EEG signals were used to describe the characteristics of the brain electrical signals."
25747342,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a non-invasive approach to measure the electrical activities of brain neurons and has long been employed for the development of brain-computer interface (BCI). For this purpose, various patterns/features of EEG data need to be extracted and associated with specific events like cue-paced motor imagery. However, this is a challenging task since EEG data are usually non-stationary time series with a low signal-to-noise ratio. In this study, we propose a novel method, called structure constrained semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SCS-NMF), to extract the key patterns of EEG data in time domain by imposing the mean envelopes of event-related potentials (ERPs) as constraints on the semi-NMF procedure. The proposed method is applicable to general EEG time series, and the extracted temporal features by SCS-NMF can also be combined with other features in frequency domain to improve the performance of motor imagery classification. Real data experiments have been performed using the SCS-NMF approach for motor imagery classification, and the results clearly suggest the superiority of the proposed method. Comparison experiments have also been conducted. The compared methods include ICA, PCA, Semi-NMF, Wavelets, EMD and CSP, which further verified the effectivity of SCS-NMF. The SCS-NMF method could obtain better or competitive performance over the state of the art methods, which provides a novel solution for brain pattern analysis from the perspective of structure constraint."

ELM solved the major bottleneck of feedforward neural networks in learning speed, this classifier was easily implemented and less sensitive to specified parameters. The 2-class fNIRS-BCI system was firstly built with an average accuracy of 76.7%, when all force and speed tasks were categorized as one class, respectively. The multi-class systems based on different levels of force and speed attempted to be investigated, the accuracies were moderate.

A sham-controlled, randomized controlled trial. Patients recruited through a hospital stroke rehabilitation program. Subjects (N=19) who incurred a stroke 0.8 to 4.3 years prior, with moderate to severe upper extremity functional impairment, and passed BCI screening. Ten sessions of 20 minutes of tDCS or sham before 1 hour of MI-BCI with robotic feedback upper limb stroke rehabilitation for 2 weeks. Each rehabilitation session comprised 8 minutes of evaluation and 1 hour of therapy. Upper extremity Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (FMMA) scores measured end-intervention at week 2 and follow-up at week 4, online BCI accuracies from the evaluation part, and laterality coefficients of the electroencephalogram (EEG) from the therapy part of the 10 rehabilitation sessions. FMMA score improved in both groups at week 4, but no intergroup differences were found at any time points. Online accuracies of the evaluation part from the tDCS group were significantly higher than those from the sham group. The EEG laterality coefficients from the therapy part of the tDCS group were significantly higher than those of the sham group. The results suggest a role for tDCS in facilitating motor imagery in stroke."

Proof-of-principle study. Neurorehabilitation hospital. Convenience sample of patients (N=8) with new-onset arm plegia or paresis caused by unilateral stroke. The BCI-based intervention was administered as an ""add-on"" to usual care and lasted 4 weeks. Under the supervision of a therapist, patients were asked to practice motor imagery of their affected hand and received as a discrete feedback the movements of a ""virtual"" hand superimposed on their own. Such a BCI-based device was installed in a rehabilitation hospital ward. Following a user-centered design, we assessed system usability in terms of motivation, satisfaction (by means of visual analog scales), and workload (National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Task Load Index). The usability of the BCI-based system was also evaluated by 15 therapists who participated in a focus group. All patients successfully accomplished the BCI training. Significant positive correlations were found between satisfaction and motivation (P=.001, r=.393). BCI performance correlated with interest (P=.027, r=.257) and motivation (P=.012, r=.289). During the focus group, professionals positively acknowledged the opportunity offered by BCI-assisted training to measure patients' adherence to rehabilitation.

Initial assessment included imagined hand movement or toe wiggling to activate sensorimotor areas and modulate brain rhythms in 90 trials (4 subjects). Within-subject and within-group analyses were performed to evaluate significant activations. A within-subject analysis was performed involving multiple BCI technology training sessions to improve the capacity of the user to modulate sensorimotor rhythms through visual and auditory feedback. Hospital, homes of subjects, and a primary care facility. Subjects (N=4; 3 men, 1 woman) who were in a minimally conscious state (age range, 27-53 y; 1-12 y after brain injury). Not applicable. Awareness detection was determined from sensorimotor patterns that differed for each motor imagery task. BCI performance was determined from the mean classification accuracy of brain patterns by using a BCI signal processing framework and assessment of performance in multiple sessions. All subjects demonstrated significant and appropriate brain activation during the initial assessment, and real-time feedback was provided to improve arousal. Consistent activation was observed in multiple sessions. The electroencephalogram-based assessment showed that patients in a minimally conscious state may have the capacity to operate a simple BCI-based communication system, even without any detectable volitional control of movement."
25712802,"Motor imagery (MI) is assumed to enhance poststroke motor recovery, yet its benefits are debatable. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide instantaneous and quantitative measure of cerebral functions modulated by MI. The efficacy of BCI-monitored MI practice as add-on intervention to usual rehabilitation care was evaluated in a randomized controlled pilot study in subacute stroke patients. Twenty-eight hospitalized subacute stroke patients with severe motor deficits were randomized into 2 intervention groups: 1-month BCI-supported MI training (BCI group, n = 14) and 1-month MI training without BCI support (control group; n = 14). Functional and neurophysiological assessments were performed before and after the interventions, including evaluation of the upper limbs by Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA; primary outcome measure) and analysis of oscillatory activity and connectivity at rest, based on high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. Better functional outcome was observed in the BCI group, including a significantly higher probability of achieving a clinically relevant increase in the FMA score (p < 0.03). Post-BCI training changes in EEG sensorimotor power spectra (ie, stronger desynchronization in the alpha and beta bands) occurred with greater involvement of the ipsilesional hemisphere in response to MI of the paralyzed trained hand. Also, FMA improvements (effectiveness of FMA) correlated with the changes (ie, post-training increase) at rest in ipsilesional intrahemispheric connectivity in the same bands (p < 0.05). The introduction of BCI technology in assisting MI practice demonstrates the rehabilitative potential of MI, contributing to significantly better motor functional outcomes in subacute stroke patients with severe motor impairments."
25702459,Studied are sources of brain activity contributing to EEG patterns which correspond to motor imagery. The accuracy of their classification determines the efficiency of brain-computer interface (BCI) allowing for controlling external technical devices directly by brain signals without involving muscle activity. Sources of brain activity are identified by Independent Component Analysis. Those independent components for which the BCI classification accuracy are at maximum are treated as relevant for motor imagery task. Two of the most relevant sources demonstrate strictly exposed event related desynchronization and synchronization of mu--rhythm during imagery of contra--and ipsilateral hands. These sources are localized by solving inverse EEG problem taking into account individual geometry of brain and its covers provided by anatomical MRI images. The sources are shown to be localized in BA 3A relating to proprioceptive sensitivity of the contralateral hand. Their positions are closed to foci of BOLD activity obtained by fMRI.
25698307,"The aim of this study was to test how the presence of central neuropathic pain (CNP) influences the performance of a motor imagery based Brain Computer Interface (BCI). In this electroencephalography (EEG) based study, we tested BCI classification accuracy and analysed event related desynchronisation (ERD) in 3 groups of volunteers during imagined movements of their arms and legs. The groups comprised of nine able-bodied people, ten paraplegic patients with CNP (lower abdomen and legs) and nine paraplegic patients without CNP. We tested two types of classifiers: a 3 channel bipolar montage and classifiers based on common spatial patterns (CSPs), with varying number of channels and CSPs. Paraplegic patients with CNP achieved higher classification accuracy and had stronger ERD than paraplegic patients with no pain for all classifier configurations. Highest 2-class classification accuracy was achieved for CSP classifier covering wider cortical area: 82±7% for patients with CNP, 82±4% for able-bodied and 78±5% for patients with no pain. Presence of CNP improves BCI classification accuracy due to stronger and more distinct ERD. Results of the study show that CNP is an important confounding factor influencing the performance of motor imagery based BCI based on ERD."
25680208,"Practical motor imagery-based brain computer interface (MI-BCI) applications are limited by the difficult to decode brain signals in a reliable way. In this paper, we propose a processing framework to address non-stationarity, as well as handle spectral, temporal, and spatial characteristics associated with execution of motor tasks. Stacked generalization is used to exploit the power of classifier ensembles for combining information coming from multiple sources and reducing the existing uncertainty in EEG signals. The outputs of several regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) models are combined to account for temporal, spatial, and spectral information. The resultant algorithm is called stacked RLDA (SRLDA). Additionally, an adaptive processing stage is introduced before classification to reduce the harmful effect of intersession non-stationarity. The benefits of the proposed method are evaluated on the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a. We demonstrate its effectiveness in binary and multiclass settings with four different motor imagery tasks: left-hand, right-hand, both feet, and tongue movements. The results show that adaptive SRLDA outperforms the winner of the competition and other approaches tested on this multiclass dataset. "
25680205,"Motor imagery-related mu/beta rhythms, which can be voluntarily modulated by subjects, have been widely used in EEG-based brain computer interfaces (BCIs). Moreover, it has been suggested that motor imagery-specific EEG differences can be enhanced by feedback training. However, the differences observed in the EEGs of naive subjects are typically not sufficient to provide reliable EEG control and thus result in unintended feedback. Such feedback can frustrate subjects and impede training. In this study, a hybrid BCI paradigm combining motor imagery and steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) has been proposed to provide effective continuous feedback for motor imagery training. During the initial training sessions, subjects must focus on flickering buttons to evoke SSVEPs as they perform motor imagery tasks. The output/feedback of the hybrid BCI is based on hybrid features consisting of motor imagery- and SSVEP-related brain signals. In this context, the SSVEP plays a more important role than motor imagery in generating feedback. As the training progresses, the subjects can gradually decrease their visual attention to the flickering buttons, provided that the feedback is still effective. In this case, the feedback is mainly based on motor imagery. Our experimental results demonstrate that subjects generate distinguishable brain patterns of hand motor imagery after only five training sessions lasting approximately 1.5 h each. The proposed hybrid feedback paradigm can be used to enhance motor imagery training. This hybrid BCI system with feedback can effectively identify the intentions of the subjects."
25674060,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a communication system that allows the use of brain activity to control computers or other external devices. It can, by bypassing the peripheral nervous system, provide a means of communication for people suffering from severe motor disabilities or in a persistent vegetative state. In this paper, brain-signal generation tasks, noise removal methods, feature extraction/selection schemes, and classification techniques for fNIRS-based BCI are reviewed. The most common brain areas for fNIRS BCI are the primary motor cortex and the prefrontal cortex. In relation to the motor cortex, motor imagery tasks were preferred to motor execution tasks since possible proprioceptive feedback could be avoided. In relation to the prefrontal cortex, fNIRS showed a significant advantage due to no hair in detecting the cognitive tasks like mental arithmetic, music imagery, emotion induction, etc. In removing physiological noise in fNIRS data, band-pass filtering was mostly used. However, more advanced techniques like adaptive filtering, independent component analysis (ICA), multi optodes arrangement, etc. are being pursued to overcome the problem that a band-pass filter cannot be used when both brain and physiological signals occur within a close band. In extracting features related to the desired brain signal, the mean, variance, peak value, slope, skewness, and kurtosis of the noised-removed hemodynamic response were used. For classification, the linear discriminant analysis method provided simple but good performance among others: support vector machine (SVM), hidden Markov model (HMM), artificial neural network, etc. fNIRS will be more widely used to monitor the occurrence of neuro-plasticity after neuro-rehabilitation and neuro-stimulation. Technical breakthroughs in the future are expected via bundled-type probes, hybrid EEG-fNIRS BCI, and through the detection of initial dips. "
25668430,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has attracted significant attention over recent decades, and has made remarkable progress. However, BCI still faces a critical hurdle, in that performance varies greatly across and even within subjects, an obstacle that degrades the reliability of BCI systems. Understanding the causes of these problems is important if we are to create more stable systems. In this short review, we report the most recent studies and findings on performance variation, especially in motor imagery-based BCI, which has found that low-performance groups have a less-developed brain network that is incapable of motor imagery. Further, psychological and physiological states influence performance variation within subjects. We propose a possible strategic approach to deal with this variation, which may contribute to improving the reliability of BCI. In addition, the limitations of current work and opportunities for future studies are discussed. "
25665968,"Neurofeedback of self-regulated brain activity in circumscribed cortical regions is used as a novel strategy to facilitate functional restoration following stroke. Basic knowledge about its impact on motor system oscillations and functional connectivity is however scarce. Specifically, a direct comparison between different feedback modalities and their neural signatures is missing. We assessed a neurofeedback training intervention of modulating β-activity in circumscribed sensorimotor regions by kinesthetic motor imagery (MI). Right-handed healthy participants received two different feedback modalities contingent to their MI-associated brain activity in a cross-over design: (I) visual feedback with a brain-computer interface (BCI) and (II) proprioceptive feedback with a brain-robot interface (BRI) orthosis attached to the right hand. High-density electroencephalography was used to examine the reactivity of the cortical motor system during the training session of each task by studying both local oscillatory power entrainment and distributed functional connectivity. Both feedback modalities activated a distributed functional connectivity network of coherent oscillations. A significantly higher skill and lower variability of self-controlled sensorimotor β-band modulation could, however, be achieved in the BRI condition. This gain in controlling regional motor oscillations was accompanied by functional coupling of remote β-band and θ-band activity in bilateral fronto-central regions and left parieto-occipital regions, respectively. The functional coupling of coherent θ-band oscillations correlated moreover with the skill of regional β-modulation thus revealing a motor learning related network. Our findings indicate that proprioceptive feedback is more suitable than visual feedback to entrain the motor network architecture during the interplay between motor imagery and feedback processing thus resulting in better volitional control of regional brain activity.

25659465,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a potential means to replace or restore lost motor function. However, BCI performance varies considerably between users, the reasons for which are poorly understood. Here we investigated the relationship between sensorimotor rhythm (SMR)-based BCI performance and brain structure. Participants were instructed to control a computer cursor using right- and left-hand motor imagery, which primarily modulated their left- and right-hemispheric SMR powers, respectively. Although most participants were able to control the BCI with success rates significantly above chance level even at the first encounter, they also showed substantial inter-individual variability in BCI success rate. Participants also underwent T1-weighted three-dimensional structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI data were subjected to voxel-based morphometry using BCI success rate as an independent variable. We found that BCI performance correlated with gray matter volume of the supplementary motor area, supplementary somatosensory area, and dorsal premotor cortex. We suggest that SMR-based BCI performance is associated with development of non-primary somatosensory and motor areas. Advancing our understanding of BCI performance in relation to its neuroanatomical correlates may lead to better customization of BCIs based on individual brain structure. "
25655381,"Brain-computer interface technology has been applied to stroke patients to improve their motor function. Event-related desynchronization during motor imagery, which is used as a brain-computer interface trigger, is sometimes difficult to detect in stroke patients. Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is known to increase event-related desynchronization. This study investigated the adjunctive effect of anodal tDCS for brain-computer interface training in patients with severe hemiparesis. Eighteen patients with chronic stroke. A non-randomized controlled study. Subjects were divided between a brain-computer interface group and a tDCS- brain-computer interface group and participated in a 10-day brain-computer interface training. Event-related desynchronization was detected in the affected hemisphere during motor imagery of the affected fingers. The tDCS-brain-computer interface group received anodal tDCS before brain-computer interface training. Event-related desynchronization was evaluated before and after the intervention. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment upper extremity motor score (FM-U) was assessed before, immediately after, and 3 months after, the intervention. Event-related desynchronization was significantly increased in the tDCS- brain-computer interface group. The FM-U was significantly increased in both groups. The FM-U improvement was maintained at 3 months in the tDCS-brain-computer interface group. Anodal tDCS can be a conditioning tool for brain-computer interface training in patients with severe hemiparetic stroke."
25640806,"Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive optical technique used for brain-computer interface (BCI). This study aims to investigate the brain hemodynamic responses of clench force and speed motor imagery and extract task-relevant features to obtain better classification performance. Given the non-stationary characteristics of real hemodynamic measurements, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was applied to reduce the physiological noise overwhelmed in the task-relevant NIRS signals. Compared with continuous wavelet decomposition, EMD does not require a pre-determined basis function. EMD decomposes the original signals into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). In this study, joint mutual information was applied to select the optimal features, and support vector machine was used as a classifier. Offline and pseudo-online analyses showed that the most feasible classification accuracy can be obtained using IMFs as input features. Accordingly, an alternative feature is provided to develop the NIRS-BCI system. "
25614021,"The idea of using brain computer interfaces (BCI) for rehabilitation emerged relatively recently. Basically, BCI for neurorehabilitation involves the recording and decoding of local brain signals generated by the patient, as he/her tries to perform a particular task (even if imperfect), or during a mental imagery task. The main objective is to promote the recruitment of selected brain areas involved and to facilitate neural plasticity. The recorded signal can be used in several ways: (i) to objectify and strengthen motor imagery-based training, by providing the patient feedback on the imagined motor task, for example, in a virtual environment; (ii) to generate a desired motor task via functional electrical stimulation or rehabilitative robotic orthoses attached to the patient's limb – encouraging and optimizing task execution as well as ""closing"" the disrupted sensorimotor loop by giving the patient the appropriate sensory feedback; (iii) to understand cerebral reorganizations after lesion, in order to influence or even quantify plasticity-induced changes in brain networks. For example, applying cerebral stimulation to re-equilibrate inter-hemispheric imbalance as shown by functional recording of brain activity during movement may help recovery. Its potential usefulness for a patient population has been demonstrated on various levels and its diverseness in interface applications makes it adaptable to a large population. The position and status of these very new rehabilitation systems should now be considered with respect to our current and more or less validated traditional methods, as well as in the light of the wide range of possible brain damage. The heterogeneity in post-damage expression inevitably complicates the decoding of brain signals and thus their use in pathological conditions, asking for controlled clinical trials."
25599079,"Human subjects can learn to control a one-dimensional electrocorticographic (ECoG) brain-computer interface (BCI) using modulation of primary motor (M1) high-gamma activity (signal power in the 75-200 Hz range). However, the stability and dynamics of the signals over the course of new BCI skill acquisition have not been investigated. In this study, we report 3 characteristic periods in evolution of the high-gamma control signal during BCI training: initial, low task accuracy with corresponding low power modulation in the gamma spectrum, followed by a second period of improved task accuracy with increasing average power separation between activity and rest, and a final period of high task accuracy with stable (or decreasing) power separation and decreasing trial-to-trial variance. These findings may have implications in the design and implementation of BCI control algorithms."
25571522,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings aroused as inputs of a motor imagery based BCI system. Eye blinks contaminate the spectral frequency of the EEG signals. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) has been already proved for removing these artifacts whose frequency band overlap with the EEG of interest. However, already ICA developed methods, use a reference lead such as the ElectroOculoGram (EOG) to identify the ocular artifact components. In this study, artifactual components were identified using an adaptive thresholding by means of Kmeans clustering. The denoised EEG signals have been fed into a feature extraction algorithm extracting the band power, the coherence and the phase locking value and inserted into a linear discriminant analysis classifier for a motor imagery classification.

25571485,"In order to enhance the usability of a motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (BCI), it is highly desirable to reduce the calibration time. Due to inter-subject variability, typically a new subject has to undergo a 20-30 minutes calibration session to collect sufficient data for training a BCI model based on his/her brain patterns. This paper proposes a new subject-to-subject adaptation algorithm to reliably reduce the calibration time of a new subject to only 3-4 minutes. To reduce the calibration time, unlike several past studies, the proposed algorithm does not require a large pool of historic sessions. In the proposed algorithm, using only a few trials from the new subject, first, the new subject's data is adapted to each available historic session separately. This is done by a linear transformation minimizing the distribution difference between the two groups of EEG data. Thereafter, among the available historic sessions, the one matched the most to the new subject's adapted data is selected as the calibration session. Consequently, the previously trained model based on the selected historic session is entirely used for the classification of the new subject's data after adaptation. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a publicly available dataset with 9 subjects. For each subject, the calibration session is selected only from the calibration sessions of the eight other subjects. The experimental results showed that our proposed algorithm not only reduced the calibration time by 85%, but also performed on average only 1.7% less accurate than the subject-dependent calibration results.

25571024,"This paper introduces a new signal processing method called Spatio-Temporal Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition (ST-MEMD). It is a new variation of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) that takes spatial and temporal information into account simultaneously rather than processing each signal source in isolation. The original and new methods were tested on single-trial electroencephalogram data with a two-class problem, in this case data using the Motor Imagery paradigm in brain-computer interfacing. However, whilst ST-MEMD retained the increase in sensitivity and specificity from adding spatial data, the new temporal data made no meaningful difference in terms of performance. "
25570777,"The age-related impairment is an increasing problem due to the aging suffered by the population, especially in developed countries. It is usual to use electroencephalogram (EEG)-based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems by means of the signal in order to assist and to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities. However, a parallel research line addresses the problem by the use of BCI systems as a way to train cognitive areas to achieve a deceleration of cognitive impairment or even an improvement. In this regard, a neurofeedback training (NFT) tool using motor imagery-based BCI, was developed. Training consists on imagery motor exercises combined with memory and logical relation tasks. In order to assess the effectiveness of the application 40 subjects, older than 59 years old, took part in this study. Our NFT application was tested by 20 subjects and their scores of a neuropsychological test were compared with the remaining 20 subjects who did not perform the NFT. Results show a significant improvement of three cognitive features after performing the NFT: visual perception, expressive speech, and immediate memory. Therefore, evidences show that the performance of a NFT tool based on motor imagery tasks could be a positive activity for slow down the aging effects. "
25570621,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) data analysis algorithms consist of multiple processing steps each with a number of free parameters. A joint optimization methodology can be used as a wrapper to fine-tune these parameters for the patient or application. This approach is inspired by deep learning neural network models, but differs because the processing layers for EEG are heterogeneous with different approaches used for processing space and time. Nonetheless, we treat the processing stages as a neural network and apply backpropagation to jointly optimize the parameters. This approach outperforms previous results on the BCI Competition II - dataset IV; additionally, it outperforms the common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm on the BCI Competition III dataset IV. In addition, the optimized parameters in the architecture are still interpretable. "
25570375,"This work investigates the potential of a four-class motor-imagery-based brain-computer interface (BCI) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Four motor imagery tasks (right hand, left hand, right foot, and left foot tapping) were executed while motor cortex activity was recorded via fNIRS. Preliminary results from three participants suggest that this could be a viable BCI interface, with two subjects achieving 50% accuracy. fNIRS is a noninvasive, safe, portable, and affordable optical brain imaging technique used to monitor cortical hemodynamic changes. Because of its portability and ease of use, fNIRS is amenable to deployment in more natural settings. Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) BCIs have already been used with up to four motor-imagery-based commands. While fNIRS-based BCIs are relatively new, success with EEG and fMRI systems, as well as signal characteristics similar to fMRI and complementary to EEG, suggest that fNIRS could serve to build or augment future BCIs.

25570337,"To address the nonstationarity issue in EEG-based brain computer interface (BCI), the computational model trained using the training data needs to adapt to the data from the test sessions. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptation approach based on the divergence framework. Cross-session changes can be taken into consideration by searching the discriminative subspaces for test data on the manifold of orthogonal matrices in a semi-supervised manner. Subsequently, the feature space becomes more consistent across sessions and classifiers performance can be enhanced. Experimental results show that the proposed adaptation method yields improvements in classification performance. "
25570246,"We propose a novel approach for measuring the stationarity level of multichannel time-series. This measure is based on stationarity definition over time-varying spectra and aims to quantify the relationship between local (single-channel dynamics) and global (multichannel dynamics) stationarity. With the purpose of separate among several motor/imagery tasks, we asssume that movement imagination implies an increase on the EEG variability, consequently, as discriminant features, we first compute the non-stationary components of input signals, and we further obtain its stationary level throughout the proposed measure. To assess the separability level of the proposed features, we employ the t-student test. Obtained results evidence that our measure is able to accurately detect brain areas projected on the scalp where motor tasks are performed. "
25570208,"Current EEG based brain computer interface (BCI) systems have achieved successful control in up to 3 dimensions; however the current paradigm may be unnatural for many rehabilitative and recreational applications. Therefore there is a great need to find motor imagination (MI) tasks that are realistic for output device control. In this paper we present our results on classifying hand gesture MI tasks, including right hand flexion, extension, supination and pronation using a novel EEG inverse imaging approach. By using both temporal and spatial specificity in the source domain we were able to separate MI tasks with up to 95% accuracy for binary classification of any two tasks compared to a maximum of only 79% in the sensor domain."
25570207,"An electroencephalography (EEG)-based Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interface (MI-BCI) requires a long setup time if a large number of channels is used, and EEG from noisy or irrelevant channels may adversely affect the classification performance. To address this issue, this paper proposed 2 approaches to systematically select discriminative channels for EEG-based MI-BCI. The proposed Discriminative Channel Addition (DCA) approach and the Discriminative Channel Reduction (DCR) approach selects subject-specific discriminative channels by iteratively adding or removing channels based on the cross-validation classification accuracies obtained using the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern algorithm. The performances of the proposed approaches were evaluated on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a. The results on 2-class and 4-class MI data showed that DCA, which iteratively adds channels, selected 13~14 channels that consistently yielded better cross-validation accuracies on the training data and session-to-session transfer accuracies on the evaluation data compared to the use of a full 22-channel setup. Hence, this results in a reduced channel setup that could improve the classification accuracy of the MI-BCI after removing less discriminative channels."
25570197,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been demonstrated that it can enhance the cortex excitability and modulate the event-related desynchronization (ERD) in motor imagery (MI). Phase synchronization is an important signature in the brain that reflects the neural interaction and integration, which has been adopted as an important EEG pattern for Brian-Computer Interface (BCI) control. In this study, we designed an experiment paradigm and investigated whether the tDCS can modulate the phase synchronization between the primary motor cortex (M1) and the supplementary motor area (SMA) in MI. Ten healthy subjects were selected and separated into two groups randomly. They performed the left and right hand MI task in two successive sessions. According to the different groups, anodal or sham stimulation were administrated to the right side of the M1. The phase locking value (PLV), which is a reliable measurement of phase synchronization in MI, was calculated. The pre and post-stimulation normalized PLV in the left hand MI task were compared. The result manifests that the normalized PLV of the entire subjects in anodal stimulation group increases after the stimulation, which shows a statistically significant difference (paired t-test p = 0.0371, n = 5). Our study reveals that the tDCS can impact the neural coupling between different brain regions and modulate phase synchronization in MI. Moreover, intervention of phase synchronization by tDCS might contribute to the rehabilitation of people with motor disorder and neurological disorders."

Results suggest that such index can be adopted to sort the trails within a session according to the adherence to the task. "

This work presents a novel co-adaptive training protocol shifting the focus on subject-related performances and the optimal accommodation of the interactions between the two learning agents of the BCI loop. Preliminary results with 8 able-bodied individuals demonstrate that the proposed method has been able to bring 3 naive users into control of a MI BCI within a few runs and to improve the BCI performances of 3 experienced BCI users by an average of 0.36 bits/sec."
25570187,"The application of rehabilitation programs based on videogames with brain-computer interfaces (BCI) allows to provide feedback to the user with the expectation of stimulate the brain plasticity that will restore the motor control. The use of specific mental strategies such as Motor Imagery (MI) in neuroscientific experiments with BCI systems often requires the acquisition of sophisticated interfaces and specialized software for execution, which usually have a high implementation costs. We present a combination of low-cost hardware and open-source software for the implementation of videogame based on virtual reality with MI and its potential use as neurotherapy for stroke patients. Three machine learning algorithms for the BCI signals classification are shown: LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) and two Support Vector Machines (SVM) in order to determine which task of MI is being performed by the user in a particular moment of the experiment. All classification algorithms was evaluated in 8 healthy subjects, the average accuracy of the best classifier was 96.7%, which shows that it is possible to carry out serious neuroscientific experiments with MI using low-cost BCI systems and achieve comparable accuracies with more sophisticated and expensive devices."
25570134,We present a study in which participants were trained in several sessions to control a (comparatively simple) robot via an EEG-/motor imagery-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). In the final (experiment) session pairs of participants were formed and each participant controlled one of two robots in a shared space. EEG data was recorded synchronously from both participants. We performed a joint data analysis on the datasets and found increases of phase-locking in μ- and θ-band. One such phase-locking effect appears to be time-locked to the start of the robotic action.
25570048,"This paper proposed a novel method to select the effective Electroencephalography (EEG) channels for the motor imagery tasks based on the inconsistencies from multiple classifiers. The inconsistency criterion for channel selection was designed based on the fluctuation of the classification accuracies among different classifiers when the noisy channels were included. These noisy channels were then identified and removed till a required number of channels was selected or a predefined classification accuracy with reference to baseline was obtained. Experiments conducted on a data set of 13 healthy subjects performing hand grasping and idle revealed that the EEG channels from the motor area were most frequently selected. Furthermore, the mean increases of 4.07%, 3.10% and 1.77% of the averaged accuracies in comparison with the four existing channel selection methods were achieved for the non-feedback, feedback and calibration sessions, respectively, by selecting as low as seven channels. These results further validated the effectiveness of our proposed method. "
25566029,"Further development of an EEG based communication device for patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC) could benefit from addressing the following gaps in knowledge-first, an evaluation of different types of motor imagery; second, an evaluation of passive feet movement as a mean of an initial classifier setup; and third, rapid delivery of biased feedback. To that end we investigated whether complex and/or familiar mental imagery, passive, and attempted feet movement can be reliably detected in patients with DoC using EEG recordings, aiming to provide them with a means of communication. Six patients in a minimally conscious state (MCS) took part in this study. The patients were verbally instructed to perform different mental imagery tasks (sport, navigation), as well as attempted feet movements, to induce distinctive event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/S) patterns in the EEG. Offline classification accuracies above chance level were reached in all three tasks (i.e., attempted feet, sport, and navigation), with motor tasks yielding significant (p < 0.05) results more often than navigation (sport: 10 out of 18 sessions; attempted feet: 7 out of 14 sessions; navigation: 4 out of 12 sessions). The passive feet movements, evaluated in one patient, yielded mixed results: whereas time-frequency analysis revealed task-related EEG changes over neurophysiological plausible cortical areas, the classification results were not significant enough (p < 0.05) to setup an initial classifier for the detection of attempted movements. Concluding, the results presented in this study are consistent with the current state of the art in similar studies, to which we contributed by comparing different types of mental tasks, notably complex motor imagery and attempted feet movements, within patients. Furthermore, we explored new venues, such as an evaluation of passive feet movement as a mean of an initial classifier setup, and rapid delivery of biased feedback. "
25560222,"To review various types of electroencephalographic activities of the brain and present an overview of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems' history and their applications in rehabilitation. A scoping review of published English literature on BCI application in the field of rehabilitation was undertaken. IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and Scopus databases were searched since inception up to August 2012. All experimental studies published in English and discussed complete cycle of the BCI process was included in the review. In total, 90 articles met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Various approaches that improve the accuracy and performance of BCI systems were discussed. Based on BCI's clinical application, reviewed articles were categorized into three groups: motion rehabilitation, speech rehabilitation and virtual reality control (VRC). Almost half of the reviewed papers (48%) concentrated on VRC. Speech rehabilitation and motion rehabilitation made up 33% and 19% of the reviewed papers, respectively. Among different types of electroencephalography signals, P300, steady state visual evoked potentials and motor imagery signals were the most common. This review discussed various applications of BCI in rehabilitation and showed how BCI can be used to improve the quality of life for people with neurological disabilities. It will develop and promote new models of communication and finally, will create an accurate, reliable, online communication between human brain and computer and reduces the negative effects of external stimuli on BCI performance. Implications for Rehabilitation The field of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) is rapidly advancing and it is expected to fulfill a critical role in rehabilitation of neurological disorders and in movement restoration in the forthcoming years. In the near future, BCI has notable potential to become a major tool used by people with disabilities to control locomotion and communicate with surrounding environment and, consequently, improve the quality of life for many affected persons. Electrical field recording at the scalp (i.e. electroencephalography) is the most likely method to be of practical value for clinical use as it is simple and non-invasive. However, some aspects need future improvements, such as the ability to separate close imagery signal (motion of extremities and phalanges that are close together)."
27170898,"In this paper, we present a new motor imagery classification method in the context of electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI). This method uses a signal-dependent orthogonal transform, referred to as linear prediction singular value decomposition (LP-SVD), for feature extraction. The transform defines the mapping as the left singular vectors of the LP coefficient filter impulse response matrix. Using a logistic tree-based model classifier; the extracted features are classified into one of four motor imagery movements. The proposed approach was first benchmarked against two related state-of-the-art feature extraction approaches, namely, discrete cosine transform (DCT) and adaptive autoregressive (AAR)-based methods. By achieving an accuracy of 67.35%, the LP-SVD approach outperformed the other approaches by large margins (25% compared with DCT and 6 % compared with AAR-based methods). To further improve the discriminatory capability of the extracted features and reduce the computational complexity, we enlarged the extracted feature subset by incorporating two extra features, namely, Q- and the Hotelling's [Formula: see text] statistics of the transformed EEG and introduced a new EEG channel selection method. The performance of the EEG classification based on the expanded feature set and channel selection method was compared with that of a number of the state-of-the-art classification methods previously reported with the BCI IIIa competition data set. Our method came second with an average accuracy of 81.38%. "
25547267,"This study aimed to find effective approaches to electroencephalographic (EEG) signal analysis and resolve problems of real and imaginary finger movement pattern recognition and categorization for one hand. Eight right-handed subjects (mean age 32.8 [SD=3.3] years) participated in the study, and activity from sensorimotor zones (central and contralateral to the movements/imagery) was recorded for EEG data analysis. In our study, we explored the decoding accuracy of EEG signals using real and imagined finger (thumb/index of one hand) movements using artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms for future brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. The decoding accuracy of the SVM based on a Gaussian radial basis function linearly increased with each trial accumulation (mean: 45%, max: 62% with 20 trial summarizations), and the decoding accuracy of the ANN was higher when single-trial discrimination was applied (mean: 38%, max: 42%). The chosen approaches of EEG signal discrimination demonstrated differential sensitivity to data accumulation. Additionally, the time responses varied across subjects and inside sessions but did not influence the discrimination accuracy of the algorithms. This work supports the feasibility of the approach, which is presumed suitable for one-hand finger movement (real and imaginary) decoding. These results could be applied in the elaboration of multiclass BCI systems."
25529197,"Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an optical imaging method that can be used for a brain-computer interface (BCI). In the present study, we concurrently measure and discriminate fNIRS signals evoked by three different mental activities, that is, mental arithmetic (MA), right-hand motor imagery (RI), and left-hand motor imagery (LI). Ten healthy subjects were asked to perform the MA, RI, and LI during a 10s task period. Using a continuous-wave NIRS system, signals were acquired concurrently from the prefrontal and the primary motor cortices. Multiclass linear discriminant analysis was utilized to classify MA vs. RI vs. LI with an average classification accuracy of 75.6% across the ten subjects, for a 2-7s time window during the a 10s task period. These results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a three-class fNIRS-BCI using three different intentionally-generated cognitive tasks as inputs. "
25527239,"According to electrophysiological studies motor imagery and motor execution are associated with perturbations of brain oscillations over spatially similar cortical areas. By contrast, neuroimaging and lesion studies suggest that at least partially distinct cortical networks are involved in motor imagery and execution. We sought to further disentangle this relationship by studying the role of brain-robot interfaces in the context of motor imagery and motor execution networks. Twenty right-handed subjects performed several behavioral tasks as indicators for imagery and execution of movements of the left hand, i.e. kinesthetic imagery, visual imagery, visuomotor integration and tonic contraction. In addition, subjects performed motor imagery supported by haptic/proprioceptive feedback from a brain-robot-interface. Principal component analysis was applied to assess the relationship of these indicators. The respective cortical resting state networks in the α-range were investigated by electroencephalography using the phase slope index. We detected two distinct abilities and cortical networks underlying motor control: a motor imagery network connecting the left parietal and motor areas with the right prefrontal cortex and a motor execution network characterized by transmission from the left to right motor areas. We found that a brain-robot-interface might offer a way to bridge the gap between these networks, opening thereby a backdoor to the motor execution system. This knowledge might promote patient screening and may lead to novel treatment strategies, e.g. for the rehabilitation of hemiparesis after stroke. "
25514553,"The authors' aim was to examine whether short-term kinesthetic training affects the level of sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) in different frequency band: alpha (8-12 Hz), lower beta (12.5-16 Hz) and beta (16.5-20 Hz) during the execution of a motor imagery task of closing and opening the right and the left hand by experts (jugglers, practicing similar exercises on an everyday basis) and amateurs (individuals not practicing any sports). It was found that the performance of short kinesthetic training increases the power of alpha rhythm when executing imagery tasks only in the group of amateurs. Therefore, kinesthetic training may be successfully used as a method increasing the vividness of motor imagery, for example, in tasks involving the control of brain-computer interfaces based on SMR."
25510922,"Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) allow direct translation of electric, magnetic or metabolic brain signals into control commands of external devices such as robots, prostheses or exoskeletons. However, non-stationarity of brain signals and susceptibility to biological or environmental artifacts impede reliable control and safety of BMIs, particularly in daily life environments. Here we introduce and tested a novel hybrid brain-neural computer interaction (BNCI) system fusing electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) to enhance reliability and safety of continuous hand exoskeleton-driven grasping motions. 12 healthy volunteers (8 male, mean age 28.1 ± 3.63y) used EEG (condition #1) and hybrid EEG/EOG (condition #2) signals to control a hand exoskeleton. Motor imagery-related brain activity was translated into exoskeleton-driven hand closing motions. Unintended motions could be interrupted by eye movement-related EOG signals. In order to evaluate BNCI control and safety, participants were instructed to follow a visual cue indicating either to move or not to move the hand exoskeleton in a random order. Movements exceeding 25% of a full grasping motion when the device was not supposed to be moved were defined as safety violation. While participants reached comparable control under both conditions, safety was frequently violated under condition #1 (EEG), but not under condition #2 (EEG/EOG). EEG/EOG biosignal fusion can substantially enhance safety of assistive BNCI systems improving their applicability in daily life environments."
25476924,"One of the difficulties for the implementation of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems for motor impaired patients is the time consumed in the system design process, since patients do not have the adequate physical nor psychological conditions to complete the process. For this reason most of BCIs are designed in a subject-dependent approach using data of healthy subjects. The developing of subject-independent systems is an option to decrease the required training sessions to design a BCI with patient functionality. This paper presents a proof-of-concept study to evaluate subject-independent system based on hand motor imagery taking gender into account. Subject-Independent BCIs are proposed using Common Spatial Patterns and log variance features of two groups of healthy subjects; one of the groups was composed by people of male gender and the other one by people of female gender. The performance of the developed gender-specific BCI designs was evaluated with respect to a subject-independent BCI designed without taking gender into account, and afterwards its performance was evaluated with data of two healthy subjects that were not included in the initial sample. As an additional test to probe the potential use for subcortical stroke patients we applied the methodology to two patients with right hand weakness. T-test was employed to determine the significance of the difference between traditional approach and the proposed gender-specific approach. For most of the tested conditions, the gender-specific BCIs have a statistically significant better performance than those that did not take gender into account. It was also observed that with a BCI designed with log-variance features in the alpha and beta band of healthy subjects' data, it was possible to classify hand motor imagery of subcortical stroke patients above the practical level of chance. A larger subjects' sample test may be necessary to improve the performances of the gender-specific BCIs and to further test this methodology on different patients. The reduction of complexity in the implementation of BCI systems could bring these systems closer to applications such as controlling devices for the motor rehabilitation of stroke patients, and therefore, contribute to a more effective neurological rehabilitation."
25467185,"Event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the electroencephalogram (EEG) from the motor cortex is associated with execution, observation, and mental imagery of motor tasks. Generation of ERD by motor imagery (MI) has been widely used for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) linked to neuroprosthetics and other motor assistance devices. Control of MI-based BCIs can be acquired by neurofeedback training to reliably induce MI-associated ERD. To develop more effective training conditions, we investigated the effect of static and dynamic visual representations of target movements (a picture of forearms or a video clip of hand grasping movements) during the BCI neurofeedback training. After 4 consecutive training days, the group that performed MI while viewing the video showed significant improvement in generating MI-associated ERD compared with the group that viewed the static image. This result suggests that passively observing the target movement during MI would improve the associated mental imagery and enhance MI-based BCIs skills. "
25461477,"Lack of efficient calibration and task guidance in motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interface (BCI) would result in the failure of communication or control, especially in patients, such as a stroke with motor impairment and intact sensation, locked-in state amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in which the sources of data for calibration may worsen the subsequent decoding. In addition, enhancing the proprioceptive experience in MI might improve the BCI performance. In this work, we propose a new calibrating and task guidance methodology to further improve the MI BCI, exploiting the afferent nerve system through tendon vibration stimulation to induce a sensation with kinesthesia illusion. A total of 30 subjects' experiments were carried out, and randomly divided into a control group (control-group) and calibration and task guidance group (CTG-group). Online experiments have shown that MI could be decoded by classifier calibrated solely using sensation data, with 8 of the 15 subjects in the CTG-Group above 80%, 3 above 95% and all above 65%. Offline chronological cross-validation analysis shows that it has reached a comparable performance with the traditional calibration method (F (1, 14) = 0.14, P = 0.7176). In addition, the discrimination accuracy of MI in the CTG-Group is significantly 12.17% higher on average than that in the control-group (unpaired-T test, P = 0.0086), and illusory sensation indicates no significant difference (unpaired-T test, p = 0.3412). The finding of the existed similarity of the discriminative brain patterns and grand averaged ERD/ERS between imagined movement (actively induced) and illusory movement (passively evoked) also validates the proposed calibration and task guidance framework. The cognitive complexity of the illusory sensation task is much lower and more objective than that of MI. In addition, subjects' kinesthetic experience mentally simulated during the MI task might be enhanced by accessing sensory experiences from the illusory stimulation. This sensory stimulation aided BCI design could help make MI BCI more applicable."
25446453,"Extended viewing of movements of one's intact limb in a mirror as well as motor imagery have been shown to decrease pain in persons with phantom limb pain or complex regional pain syndrome and to increase the movement ability in hemiparesis following stroke. In addition, mirrored movements differentially activate sensorimotor cortex in amputees with and without phantom limb pain. However, using a so-called mirror box has technical limitations, some of which can be overcome by virtual reality applications. We developed a virtual reality mirror box application and evaluated its comparability to a classical mirror box setup. We applied both paradigms to 20 healthy controls and analyzed vividness and authenticity of the illusion as well as brain activation patterns. In both conditions, subjects reported similar intensities for the sensation that movements of the virtual left hand felt as if they were executed by their own left hand. We found activation in the primary sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the actual movement, with stronger activation for the virtual reality 'mirror box' compared to the classical mirror box condition, as well as activation in the primary sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the mirrored/virtual movement. We conclude that a virtual reality application of the mirror box is viable and that it might be useful for future research. "
25415550,"Impaired hand function decreases quality of life in persons with tetraplegia. We tested functional electrical stimulation (FES) controlled by a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) for improving hand function in participants with tetraplegia. Two participants with subacute tetraplegia (participant 1: C5 Brown-Sequard syndrome, participant 2: complete C5 lesion) took part in this proof-of-concept study. The goal was to determine whether the BCI system could drive the FES device by accurately classifying participants' intent (open or close the hand). Participants 1 and 2 received 10 sessions and 4 sessions of BCI-FES, respectively. A novel time-switch BCI strategy based on motor imagery was used to activate the FES. In one session, we tested a hybrid BCI-FES based on 2 spontaneously generated brain rhythms: a sensory-motor rhythm during motor imagery to activate a stimulator and occipital alpha rhythms to deactivate the stimulator. Participants received BCI-FES therapy 2 to 3 times a week in addition to conventional therapy. Imagery ability and muscle strength were measured before and after treatment. Visual feedback was associated with a 4-fold increase of brain response during motor imagery in both participants. For participant 1, classification accuracy (open/closed) for motor imagery-based BCI was 83.5% (left hand) and 83.8% (right hand); participant 2 had a classification accuracy of 83.8% for the right hand. Participant 1 had moderate improvement in muscle strength, while there was no change for participant 2. We demonstrated feasibility of BCI-FES, using 2 naturally generated brain rhythms. Studies on a larger number of participants are needed to separate the effects of BCI training from effects of conventional therapy.Video Abstract available.

25404753,"An electroencephalogram recognition system considering phase features is proposed to enhance the performance of motor imagery classification in this study. It mainly consists of feature extraction, feature selection and classification. Surface Laplacian filter is used for background removal. Several potential features, including phase features, are then extracted to enhance the classification accuracy. Next, genetic algorithm is used to select sub-features from feature combination. Finally, selected features are classified by extreme learning machine. Compared with ""without phase features"" and linear discriminant analysis on motor imagery data from 2 data sets, the results denote that the proposed system achieves enhanced performance, which is suitable for the brain-computer interface applications.

25372285,"We describe the first direct brain-to-brain interface in humans and present results from experiments involving six different subjects. Our non-invasive interface, demonstrated originally in August 2013, combines electroencephalography (EEG) for recording brain signals with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for delivering information to the brain. We illustrate our method using a visuomotor task in which two humans must cooperate through direct brain-to-brain communication to achieve a desired goal in a computer game. The brain-to-brain interface detects motor imagery in EEG signals recorded from one subject (the ""sender"") and transmits this information over the internet to the motor cortex region of a second subject (the ""receiver""). This allows the sender to cause a desired motor response in the receiver (a press on a touchpad) via TMS. We quantify the performance of the brain-to-brain interface in terms of the amount of information transmitted as well as the accuracies attained in (1) decoding the sender's signals, (2) generating a motor response from the receiver upon stimulation, and (3) achieving the overall goal in the cooperative visuomotor task. Our results provide evidence for a rudimentary form of direct information transmission from one human brain to another using non-invasive means. "
25368546,"Individuals with severe motor impairment can use event-related desynchronization (ERD) based BCIs as assistive technology. Auto-calibrating and adaptive ERD-based BCIs that users control with motor imagery tasks (""SMR-AdBCI"") have proven effective for healthy users. We aim to find an improved configuration of such an adaptive ERD-based BCI for individuals with severe motor impairment as a result of spinal cord injury (SCI) or stroke. We hypothesized that an adaptive ERD-based BCI, that automatically selects a user specific class-combination from motor-related and non motor-related mental tasks during initial auto-calibration (""Auto-AdBCI"") could allow for higher control performance than a conventional SMR-AdBCI. To answer this question we performed offline analyses on two sessions (21 data sets total) of cue-guided, five-class electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded from individuals with SCI or stroke. On data from the twelve individuals in Session 1, we first identified three bipolar derivations for the SMR-AdBCI. In a similar way, we determined three bipolar derivations and four mental tasks for the Auto-AdBCI. We then simulated both, the SMR-AdBCI and the Auto-AdBCI configuration on the unseen data from the nine participants in Session 2 and compared the results. On the unseen data of Session 2 from individuals with SCI or stroke, we found that automatically selecting a user specific class-combination from motor-related and non motor-related mental tasks during initial auto-calibration (Auto-AdBCI) significantly (p < 0.01) improved classification performance compared to an adaptive ERD-based BCI that only used motor imagery tasks (SMR-AdBCI; average accuracy of 75.7 vs. 66.3%). "
25307730,"We propose a new hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) system that integrates two different EEG tasks: tactile selective attention (TSA) using a vibro-tactile stimulator on the left/right finger and motor imagery (MI) of left/right hand movement. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) from the MI task and steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (SSSEP) from the TSA task are retrieved and combined into two hybrid senses. One hybrid approach is to measure two tasks simultaneously; the features of each task are combined for testing. Another hybrid approach is to measure two tasks consecutively (TSA first and MI next) using only MI features. For comparison with the hybrid approaches, the TSA and MI tasks are measured independently. Using a total of 16 subject datasets, we analyzed the BCI classification performance for MI, TSA and two hybrid approaches in a comparative manner; we found that the consecutive hybrid approach outperformed the others, yielding about a 10% improvement in classification accuracy relative to MI alone. It is understood that TSA may play a crucial role as a prestimulus in that it helps to generate earlier ERD prior to MI and thus sustains ERD longer and to a stronger degree; this ERD may give more discriminative information than ERD in MI alone. Overall, our proposed consecutive hybrid approach is very promising for the development of advanced BCI systems."
25307551,"A major assumption of brain-machine interface research is that patients with disconnected neural pathways can still volitionally recall precise motor commands that could be decoded for naturalistic prosthetic control. However, the disconnected condition of these patients also blocks kinaesthetic feedback from the periphery, which has been shown to regulate centrally generated output responsible for accurate motor control. Here, we tested how well motor commands are generated in the absence of kinaesthetic feedback by decoding hand movements from human scalp electroencephalography in three conditions: unimpaired movement, imagined movement, and movement attempted during temporary disconnection of peripheral afferent and efferent nerves by ischemic nerve block. Our results suggest that the recall of cortical motor commands is impoverished in the absence of kinaesthetic feedback, challenging the possibility of precise naturalistic cortical prosthetic control."
25270615,"This case study describes how an individual with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy was trained over a period of four weeks to use a commercial electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI). The participant spent three sessions exploring the system, and seven sessions playing a game focused on EEG feedback training of left and right arm motor imagery and a customised, training game paradigm was employed. The participant showed improvement in the production of two distinct EEG patterns. The participant's performance was influenced by motivation, fatigue and concentration. Six weeks post-training the participant could still control the BCI and used this to type a sentence using an augmentative and alternative communication application on a wirelessly linked device. The results from this case study highlight the importance of creating a dynamic, relevant and engaging training environment for BCIs. Implications for Rehabilitation Customising a training paradigm to suit the users' interests can influence adherence to assistive technology training. Mood, fatigue, physical illness and motivation influence the usability of a brain-computer interface. Commercial brain-computer interfaces, which require little set up time, may be used as access technology for individuals with severe disabilities."
25266261,"The paper proposes a novel approach toward EEG-driven position control of a robot arm by utilizing motor imagery, P300 and error-related potentials (ErRP) to align the robot arm with desired target position. In the proposed scheme, the users generate motor imagery signals to control the motion of the robot arm. The P300 waveforms are detected when the user intends to stop the motion of the robot on reaching the goal position. The error potentials are employed as feedback response by the user. On detection of error the control system performs the necessary corrections on the robot arm. Here, an AdaBoost-Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used to decode the 4-class motor imagery and an SVM is used to decode the presence of P300 and ErRP waveforms. The average steady-state error, peak overshoot and settling time obtained for our proposed approach is 0.045, 2.8% and 44 s, respectively, and the average rate of reaching the target is 95%. The results obtained for the proposed control scheme make it suitable for designs of prosthetics in rehabilitative applications."
25264791,"Brain computer interface systems (BCI) translate the intentions of patients affected with locked-in syndrome through the EEG signal characteristics, which are converted into commands used to control external devices. One of the strategies used, is to decode the motor imagery of the subject, which can modify the neuronal activity in the sensory-motor areas in a similar way to which it is observed in real movement. The present study shows the activation patterns that are registered in motor and motor imagery tasks of right and left hand movement in a sample of young healthy subjects of Mexican nationality. By means of frequency analysis it was possible to determine the difference conditions of motor imagery and movement. Using U Mann- Whitney tests, differences with statistical significance (p < 0.05) where obtained, in the EEG channels C3, Cz, C4, T3 and P3 in the mu and beta rhythms, for subjects with similar characteristics (age, gender, and education). With these results, it would be possible to define a classifier or decoder by gender that improves the performance rate and diminishes the training time, with the goal of designing a functional BCI system that can be transferred from the laboratory to the clinical application in patients with motor disabilities.

25248173,"Rejecting or selecting data from multiple trials of electroencephalography (EEG) recordings is crucial. We propose a sparsity-aware method to data selection from a set of multiple EEG recordings during motor-imagery tasks, aiming at brain machine interfaces (BMIs). Instead of empirical averaging over sample covariance matrices for multiple trials including low-quality data, which can lead to poor performance in BMI classification, we introduce weighted averaging with weight coefficients that can reject such trials. The weight coefficients are determined by the l1-minimization problem that lead to sparse weights such that almost zero-values are allocated to low-quality trials. The proposed method was successfully applied for estimating covariance matrices for the so-called common spatial pattern (CSP) method, which is widely used for feature extraction from EEG in the two-class classification. Classification of EEG signals during motor imagery was examined to support the proposed method. It should be noted that the proposed data selection method can be applied to a number of variants of the original CSP method. "
25242018,"Session-to-session nonstationarity is inherent in brain-computer interfaces based on electroencephalography. The objective of this paper is to quantify the mismatch between the training model and test data caused by nonstationarity and to adapt the model towards minimizing the mismatch. We employ a tensor model to estimate the mismatch in a semi-supervised manner, and the estimate is regularized in the discriminative objective function. The performance of the proposed adaptation method was evaluated on a dataset recorded from 16 subjects performing motor imagery tasks on different days. The classification results validated the advantage of the proposed method in comparison with other regularization-based or spatial filter adaptation approaches. Experimental results also showed that there is a significant correlation between the quantified mismatch and the classification accuracy. The proposed method approached the nonstationarity issue from the perspective of data-model mismatch, which is more direct than data variation measurement. The results also demonstrated that the proposed method is effective in enhancing the performance of the feature extraction model."
25226998,"Recently, the integration of different electrophysiological signals into an electroencephalogram (EEG) has become an effective approach to improve the practicality of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, referred to as hybrid BCIs. In this paper, a hybrid BCI was designed by combining an EEG with electrocardiograph (EOG) signals and tested using a target selection experiment. Gaze direction from the EOG and the event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) induced by motor imagery from the EEG were simultaneously detected as the output of the BCI system. The target selection mechanism was based on the synthesis of the gaze direction and ERD activity. When an ERD activity was detected, the target corresponding to the gaze direction was selected; without ERD activity, no target was selected, even when a subjects gaze was directed at the target. With this mechanism, the operation of the BCI system is more flexible and voluntary. The accuracy and completion time of the target selection tasks during the online testing were 89.3% and 2.4 seconds, respectively. These results show the feasibility and practicality of this hybrid BCI system, which can potentially be used in the rehabilitation of disabled individuals. "
25221505,"Non-invasive EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) can be promising for the motor neuro-rehabilitation of paraplegic patients. However, this shall require detailed knowledge of the abnormalities in the EEG signatures of paraplegic patients. The association of abnormalities in different subgroups of patients and their relation to the sensorimotor integration are relevant for the design, implementation and use of BCI systems in patient populations. This study explores the patterns of abnormalities of movement related cortical potentials (MRCP) during motor imagery tasks of feet and right hand in patients with paraplegia (including the subgroups with/without central neuropathic pain (CNP) and complete/incomplete injury patients) and the level of distinctiveness of abnormalities in these groups using pattern classification. The most notable observed abnormalities were the amplified execution negativity and its slower rebound in the patient group. The potential underlying mechanisms behind these changes and other minor dissimilarities in patients' subgroups, as well as the relevance to BCI applications, are discussed. The findings are of interest from a neurological perspective as well as for BCI-assisted neuro-rehabilitation and therapy. "
25206933,"Wheelchair control requires multiple degrees of freedom and fast intention detection, which makes electroencephalography (EEG)-based wheelchair control a big challenge. In our previous study, we have achieved direction (turning left and right) and speed (acceleration and deceleration) control of a wheelchair using a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) combining motor imagery and P300 potentials. In this paper, we proposed hybrid EEG-EOG BCI, which combines motor imagery, P300 potentials, and eye blinking to implement forward, backward, and stop control of a wheelchair. By performing relevant activities, users (e.g., those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and locked-in syndrome) can navigate the wheelchair with seven steering behaviors. Experimental results on four healthy subjects not only demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our brain-controlled wheelchair system but also indicate that all the four subjects could control the wheelchair spontaneously and efficiently without any other assistance (e.g., an automatic navigation system).

25162231,"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) strive to decode brain signals into control commands for severely handicapped people with no means of muscular control. These potential users of noninvasive BCIs display a large range of physical and mental conditions. Prior studies have shown the general applicability of BCI with patients, with the conflict of either using many training sessions or studying only moderately restricted patients. We present a BCI system designed to establish external control for severely motor-impaired patients within a very short time. Within only six experimental sessions, three out of four patients were able to gain significant control over the BCI, which was based on motor imagery or attempted execution. For the most affected patient, we found evidence that the BCI could outperform the best assistive technology (AT) of the patient in terms of control accuracy, reaction time and information transfer rate. We credit this success to the applied user-centered design approach and to a highly flexible technical setup. State-of-the art machine learning methods allowed the exploitation and combination of multiple relevant features contained in the EEG, which rapidly enabled the patients to gain substantial BCI control. Thus, we could show the feasibility of a flexible and tailorable BCI application in severely disabled users. This can be considered a significant success for two reasons: Firstly, the results were obtained within a short period of time, matching the tight clinical requirements. Secondly, the participating patients showed, compared to most other studies, very severe communication deficits. They were dependent on everyday use of AT and two patients were in a locked-in state. For the most affected patient a reliable communication was rarely possible with existing AT. "
25159737,"Sensorimotor rhythm patterns in patients with lower limb amputations might be altered because of reorganization of the sensorimotor cortices. The authors evaluated the sensorimotor rhythm of motor imagery (MI) in healthy subjects and patients with lower limb amputations. In addition, the authors investigated whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could modulate sensorimotor rhythm control. Six healthy subjects and six patients with lower limb amputations were assigned to receive anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS over the foot motor area in a randomized order. The authors evaluated event-related desynchronization and event-related synchronization (ERS) of unilateral hand and bilateral foot MI before and after tDCS. Beta ERS of foot MI in patients with lower limb amputations was significantly lesser than that in healthy subjects. Compared with sham stimulation, cathodal tDCS enhanced beta ERS of foot MI in patients with lower limb amputations. In contrast, anodal tDCS decreased beta ERS of foot MI in healthy subjects. This is the first study to demonstrate that cathodal tDCS can enhance a weak beta ERS of foot MI in patients with lower limb amputations. These findings might contribute in improving the effectiveness of sensorimotor rhythm-based brain computer interface for gait restoration after lower limb amputation."
25137064,"Human sensory and motor systems provide the natural means for the exchange of information between individuals, and, hence, the basis for human civilization. The recent development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) has provided an important element for the creation of brain-to-brain communication systems, and precise brain stimulation techniques are now available for the realization of non-invasive computer-brain interfaces (CBI). These technologies, BCI and CBI, can be combined to realize the vision of non-invasive, computer-mediated brain-to-brain (B2B) communication between subjects (hyperinteraction). Here we demonstrate the conscious transmission of information between human brains through the intact scalp and without intervention of motor or peripheral sensory systems. Pseudo-random binary streams encoding words were transmitted between the minds of emitter and receiver subjects separated by great distances, representing the realization of the first human brain-to-brain interface. In a series of experiments, we established internet-mediated B2B communication by combining a BCI based on voluntary motor imagery-controlled electroencephalographic (EEG) changes with a CBI inducing the conscious perception of phosphenes (light flashes) through neuronavigated, robotized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), with special care taken to block sensory (tactile, visual or auditory) cues. Our results provide a critical proof-of-principle demonstration for the development of conscious B2B communication technologies. More fully developed, related implementations will open new research venues in cognitive, social and clinical neuroscience and the scientific study of consciousness. We envision that hyperinteraction technologies will eventually have a profound impact on the social structure of our civilization and raise important ethical issues. "
25122834,"High performance of the brain-computer interface (BCI) needs efficient algorithms to extract discriminative features from raw electroencephalography (EEG) signals. In this paper, we present a novel scheme to extract spatial spectral features for the motor imagery-based BCI. The learning task is formulated by maximizing the mutual information between spatial spectral features (MMISS) and class labels, by which a unique objective function directly related to Bayes classification error is optimized. The spatial spectral features are assumed to follow a parametric Gaussian distribution, which has been validated by the normal distribution Mardia's test, and under this assumption the estimation of mutual information is derived. We propose a gradient based alternative and iterative learning algorithm to optimize the cost function and derive the spatial and spectral filters simultaneously. The experimental results on dataset IVa of BCI competition III and dataset IIa of BCI competition IV show that the proposed MMISS is able to efficiently extract discriminative features from motor imagery-based EEG signals to enhance the classification accuracy compared to other existing algorithms.

25120465,"The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of an Electroencephalography (EEG)-based Motor Imagery (MI) Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) coupled with a Haptic Knob (HK) robot for arm rehabilitation in stroke patients. In this three-arm, single-blind, randomized controlled trial; 21 chronic hemiplegic stroke patients (Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (FMMA) score 10-50), recruited after pre-screening for MI BCI ability, were randomly allocated to BCI-HK, HK or Standard Arm Therapy (SAT) groups. All groups received 18 sessions of intervention over 6 weeks, 3 sessions per week, 90 min per session. The BCI-HK group received 1 h of BCI coupled with HK intervention, and the HK group received 1 h of HK intervention per session. Both BCI-HK and HK groups received 120 trials of robot-assisted hand grasping and knob manipulation followed by 30 min of therapist-assisted arm mobilization. The SAT group received 1.5 h of therapist-assisted arm mobilization and forearm pronation-supination movements incorporating wrist control and grasp-release functions. In all, 14 males, 7 females, mean age 54.2 years, mean stroke duration 385.1 days, with baseline FMMA score 27.0 were recruited. The primary outcome measure was upper extremity FMMA scores measured mid-intervention at week 3, end-intervention at week 6, and follow-up at weeks 12 and 24. Seven, 8 and 7 subjects underwent BCI-HK, HK and SAT interventions respectively. FMMA score improved in all groups, but no intergroup differences were found at any time points. Significantly larger motor gains were observed in the BCI-HK group compared to the SAT group at weeks 3, 12, and 24, but motor gains in the HK group did not differ from the SAT group at any time point. In conclusion, BCI-HK is effective, safe, and may have the potential for enhancing motor recovery in chronic stroke when combined with therapist-assisted arm mobilization. "
25116904,"In recent years, research on Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology for healthy users has attracted considerable interest, and BCI games are especially popular. This study reviews the current status of, and describes future directions, in the field of BCI games. To this end, we conducted a literature search and found that BCI control paradigms using electroencephalographic signals (motor imagery, P300, steady state visual evoked potential and passive approach reading mental state) have been the primary focus of research. We also conducted a survey of nearly three hundred participants that included researchers, game developers and users around the world. From this survey, we found that all three groups (researchers, developers and users) agreed on the significant influence and applicability of BCI and BCI games, and they all selected prostheses, rehabilitation and games as the most promising BCI applications. User and developer groups tended to give low priority to passive BCI and the whole head sensor array. Developers gave higher priorities to ""the easiness of playing"" and the ""development platform"" as important elements for BCI games and the market. Based on our assessment, we discuss the critical point at which BCI games will be able to progress from their current stage to widespread marketing to consumers. In conclusion, we propose three critical elements important for expansion of the BCI game market: standards, gameplay and appropriate integration. "
25091344,"The study compared two channel-reduction approaches in order to investigate the effects of systematic motor imagery (MI) neurofeedback practice in an everyday environment using a very user-friendly EEG system consisting of individualized caps and highly portable hardware. Sixteen BCI novices were trained over four consecutive days to imagine left and right hand movements while receiving feedback. The most informative bipolar channels for use on the subsequent days were identified on the first day for each individual based on a high-density online MI recording. Online classification accuracy on the first day was 85.1% on average (range: 64.7-97.7%). Offline an individually-selected bipolar channel pair based on common spatial patterns significantly outperformed a pair informed by independent component analysis and a standard 10-20 pair. From day 2 to day 4 online MI accuracy increased significantly (day 2: 69.1%; day 4: 73.3%), which was mostly caused by a reduction in ipsilateral event-related desynchronization of sensorimotor rhythms. The present study demonstrates that systematic MI practice in an everyday environment with a user-friendly EEG system results in MI learning effects. These findings help to bridge the gap between elaborate laboratory studies with healthy participants and efficient home or hospital based MI neurofeedback protocols."
25080297,"To assess quantitatively the impact of task selection in the performance of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). We consider the task-pairs derived from multi-class BCI imagery movement tasks in three different datasets. We analyze for the first time the benefits of task selection on a large-scale basis (109 users) and evaluate the possibility of transferring task-pair information across days for a given subject. Selecting the subject-dependent optimal task-pair among three different imagery movement tasks results in approximately 20% potential increase in the number of users that can be expected to control a binary BCI. The improvement is observed with respect to the best task-pair fixed across subjects. The best task-pair selected for each subject individually during a first day of recordings is generally a good task-pair in subsequent days. In general, task learning from the user side has a positive influence in the generalization of the optimal task-pair, but special attention should be given to inexperienced subjects. These results add significant evidence to existing literature that advocates task selection as a necessary step towards usable BCIs. This contribution motivates further research focused on deriving adaptive methods for task selection on larger sets of mental tasks in practical online scenarios."
25071544,"Cerebral palsy (CP) includes a broad range of disorders, which can result in impairment of posture and movement control. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been proposed as assistive devices for individuals with CP. Better understanding of the neural processing underlying motor control in affected individuals could lead to more targeted BCI rehabilitation and treatment options. We have explored well-known neural correlates of movement, including event-related desynchronization (ERD), phase synchrony, and a recently-introduced measure of phase dynamics, in participants with CP and healthy control participants. Although present, significantly less ERD and phase locking were found in the group with CP. Additionally, inter-group differences in phase dynamics were also significant. Taken together these findings suggest that users with CP exhibit lower levels of motor cortex activation during motor imagery, as reflected in lower levels of ongoing mu suppression and less functional connectivity. These differences indicate that development of BCIs for individuals with CP may pose additional challenges beyond those faced in providing BCIs to healthy individuals. "
25071543,"Recent studies have shown that scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) has a great potential for motor rehabilitation in stroke patients with severe hemiplegia. However, key elements in BCI architecture for functional recovery has yet to be clear. We in this study focused on the type of feedback to the patients, which is given contingently to their motor-related EEG in a BCI context. The efficacy of visual and somatosensory feedbacks was compared by a two-group study with the chronic stroke patients who are suffering with severe motor hemiplegia. Twelve patients were asked an attempt of finger opening in the affected side repeatedly, and the event-related desynchronization (ERD) in EEG of alpha and beta rhythms was monitored over bilateral parietal regions. Six patients were received a simple visual feedback in which the hand open/grasp picture on screen was animated at eye level, following significant ERD. Six patients were received a somatosensory feedback in which the motor-driven orthosis was triggered to extend the paralyzed fingers from 90 to 50°. All the participants received 1-h BCI treatment with 12-20 training days. After the training period, while no changes in clinical scores and electromyographic (EMG) activity were observed in visual feedback group after training, voluntary EMG activity was newly observed in the affected finger extensors in four cases and the clinical score of upper limb function in the affected side was also improved in three participants in somatosensory feedback group. Although the present study was conducted with a limited number of patients, these results imply that BCI training with somatosensory feedback could be more effective for rehabilitation than with visual feedback. This pilot trial positively encouraged further clinical BCI research using a controlled design. "
25071505,Motor imagery (MI) is a commonly used paradigm for the study of motor learning or cognitive aspects of action control. The rationale for using MI training to promote the relearning of motor function arises from research on the functional correlates that MI shares with the execution of physical movements. While most of the previous studies investigating MI were based on simple movements in the present study a more attractive mental practice was used to investigate cortical activation during MI. We measured cerebral responses with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in twenty three healthy volunteers as they imagined playing soccer or tennis before and after a short physical sports exercise. Our results demonstrated that only 10 min of training are enough to boost MI patterns in motor related brain regions including premotor cortex and supplementary motor area (SMA) but also fronto-parietal and subcortical structures. This supports previous findings that MI has beneficial effects especially in combination with motor execution when used in motor rehabilitation or motor learning processes. We conclude that sports MI combined with an interactive game environment could be a promising additional tool in future rehabilitation programs aiming to improve upper or lower limb functions or support neuroplasticity. 
25058014,"The aim of the present study was to investigate functional reorganization of the occipital cortex for a mental navigation task in blind people. Eight completely blind adults and eight sighted matched controls performed a mental navigation task, in which they mentally imagined to walk along familiar routes of their hometown during a multi-channel EEG measurement. A motor imagery task was used as control condition. Furthermore, electrophysiological activation patterns during a resting measurement with open and closed eyes were compared between blind and sighted participants. During the resting measurement with open eyes, no differences in EEG power were observed between groups, whereas sighted participants showed higher alpha (8-12Hz) activity at occipital sites compared to blind participants during an eyes-closed resting condition. During the mental navigation task, blind participants showed a stronger event-related desynchronization in the alpha band over the visual cortex compared to sighted controls indicating a stronger activation in this brain region in the blind. Furthermore, groups showed differences in functional brain connectivity between fronto-central and parietal-occipital brain networks during mental navigation indicating stronger visuo-spatial processing in sighted than in blind people during mental navigation. Differences in electrophysiological parameters between groups were specific for mental navigation since no group differences were observed during motor imagery. These results indicate that in the absence of vision the visual cortex takes over other functions such as spatial navigation. "
25055835,"In a brain-computer interface for stroke rehabilitation, motor imagery is a preferred means for providing a gateway to an effector action or behavior. However, stroke patients often exhibit failure to comply with motor imagery, and therefore their motor imagery performance is highly variable. We sought to identify motor cortical areas responsible for motor imagery performance in stroke patients, specifically by using a multivariate pattern analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data. We adopted an imaginary finger tapping task in which motor imagery performance could be monitored for 12 chronic stroke patients with subcortical infarcts and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We identified the typical activation pattern elicited for motor imagery in healthy controls, as computed over the voxels within each searchlight in the motor cortex. Then we measured the similarity of each individual's activation pattern to the typical activation pattern. In terms of activation levels, the stroke patients showed no activation in the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1); in terms of activation patterns, they showed lower similarity to the typical activation pattern in the area than the healthy controls. Furthermore, the stroke patients were better able to perform motor imagery if their activation patterns in the bilateral supplementary motor areas and ipsilesional M1 were close to the typical activation pattern. These findings suggest functional roles of the motor cortical areas for compliance with motor imagery in stroke, which can be applied to the implementation of motor imagery-based brain-computer interface for stroke rehabilitation."
25036216,"A number of recent studies have demonstrated that near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a promisingneuroimaging modality for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). So far, most NIRS-based BCI studies have focusedon enhancing the accuracy of the classification of different mental tasks. In the present study, we evaluated theperformances of a variety of mental task combinations in order to determine the mental task pairs that are bestsuited for customized NIRS-based BCIs. To this end, we recorded event-related hemodynamic responses whileseven participants performed eight different mental tasks. Classification accuracies were then estimated for allpossible pairs of the eight mental tasks (8C2 = 28). Based on this analysis, mental task combinations with relatively high classification accuracies frequently included the following three mental tasks: “mental multiplication,” “mental rotation,” and “right-hand motor imagery.” Specifically, mental task combinations consisting of two of these three mental tasks showed the highest mean classification accuracies. It is expected that our results will be a useful reference to reduce the time needed for preliminary tests when discovering individual-specific mental task combinations."
25019661,"Deficiencies in upper-limb motor function and executive functioning can compromise an affected individual's ability to complete everyday activities. Impaired motor and executive functioning therefore pose a risk to increasing numbers of veterans who have been diagnosed with acquired brain injury. This article reports on changes in upper-limb motor function and executive functioning of 12 adult participants with chronic acquired brain injury using a novel, computer-based, motor and cognitive rehabilitation program called PreMotor Exercise Games (PEGs). Manual muscle, goniometric range of motion, and dynamometer assessments were used to determine motor functioning while the Executive Function Performance Test measured cognitive functioning. A three-level repeated measures design was conducted to determine changes pre- and postintervention. Participants demonstrated significant improvement in shoulder (p = 0.01) and wrist (p = 0.01) range of motion and clinically relevant improvement for elbow range of motion. Participants demonstrated clinically relevant improvement in shoulder, elbow, and wrist strength. Finally, participants demonstrated significant improvement in executive functioning (p < 0.05). Using PEGs as a modality for both motor and cognitive intervention is a potentially beneficial adjunct to rehabilitation and warrants further study. "
25014972,"We investigated whether listener-assisted scanning, an alternative communication method for persons with severe motor and visual impairments but preserved cognitive skills, could be used for spelling with EEG. To that end spoken letters were presented sequentially, and the participants made selections by performing motor execution/imagery or a cognitive task. The motor task was a brisk dorsiflexion of both feet, and the cognitive task was related to working memory and perception of human voice. The motor imagery task yielded the most promising results with respect to letter selection accuracy, albeit with a large variation in individual performance. The cognitive task yielded significant ( p = 0.05) albeit moderate results. Closer inspection of grand average ERPs for the cognitive task revealed task-related modulation of a late negative component, which is novel in the auditory BCI literature. Guidelines for further development are presented."
25014055,"Co-adaptive training paradigms for event-related desynchronization (ERD) based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have proven effective for healthy users. As of yet, it is not clear whether co-adaptive training paradigms can also benefit users with severe motor impairment. The primary goal of our paper was to evaluate a novel cue-guided, co-adaptive BCI training paradigm with severely impaired volunteers. The co-adaptive BCI supports a non-control state, which is an important step toward intuitive, self-paced control. A secondary aim was to have the same participants operate a specifically designed self-paced BCI training paradigm based on the auto-calibrated classifier. The co-adaptive BCI analyzed the electroencephalogram from three bipolar derivations (C3, Cz, and C4) online, while the 22 end users alternately performed right hand movement imagery (MI), left hand MI and relax with eyes open (non-control state). After less than five minutes, the BCI auto-calibrated and proceeded to provide visual feedback for the MI task that could be classified better against the non-control state. The BCI continued to regularly recalibrate. In every calibration step, the system performed trial-based outlier rejection and trained a linear discriminant analysis classifier based on one auto-selected logarithmic band-power feature. In 24 minutes of training, the co-adaptive BCI worked significantly (p = 0.01) better than chance for 18 of 22 end users. The self-paced BCI training paradigm worked significantly (p = 0.01) better than chance in 11 of 20 end users. The presented co-adaptive BCI complements existing approaches in that it supports a non-control state, requires very little setup time, requires no BCI expert and works online based on only two electrodes. The preliminary results from the self-paced BCI paradigm compare favorably to previous studies and the collected data will allow to further improve self-paced BCI systems for disabled users. "
24979726,"One of the main issues in motor imagery-based (MI-based) brain-computer interface (BCI) systems is a large variation in the classification performance of BCI users. However, the exact reason of low performance of some users is still under investigation. Having some prior knowledge about the performance of users may be helpful in understanding possible reasons of performance variations. In this study a novel coefficient from pre-cue EEG rhythms is proposed. The proposed coefficient is computed from the spectral power of pre-cue EEG data for specific rhythms over different regions of the brain. The feasibility of predicting the classification performance of the MI-based BCI users from the proposed coefficient is investigated. Group level analysis on N=17 healthy subjects showed that there is a significant correlation r=0.53 (p=0.02) between the proposed coefficient and the cross-validation accuracies of the subjects in performing MI. The results showed that subjects with higher cross-validation accuracies have yielded significantly higher values of the proposed coefficient and vice versa. In comparison with other previous predictors, this coefficient captures spatial information from the brain in addition to spectral information. The result of using the proposed coefficient suggests that having higher frontal theta and lower posterior alpha prior to performing MI may enhance the BCI classification performance. This finding reveals prospect of designing a novel experiment to prepare the user towards improved motor imagery performance."
24975290,"In recent years, various applications of brain computer interfaces (BCIs) have been studied. In this paper, we present a hybrid BCI combining P300 and motor imagery to operate an explorer. Our system is mainly composed of a BCI mouse, a BCI speller and an explorer. Through this system, the user can access his computer and manipulate (open, close, copy, paste, and delete) files such as documents, pictures, music, movies and so on. The system has been tested with five subjects, and the experimental results show that the explorer can be successfully operated according to subjects' intentions. "
24950192,"With advances in brain-computer interface (BCI) research, a portable few- or single-channel BCI system has become necessary. Most recent BCI studies have demonstrated that the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is a powerful tool in extracting features for multiple-class motor imagery. However, since the CSP algorithm requires multi-channel information, it is not suitable for a few- or single-channel system. In this study, we applied a short-time Fourier transform to decompose a single-channel electroencephalography signal into the time-frequency domain and construct multi-channel information. Using the reconstructed data, the CSP was combined with a support vector machine to obtain high classification accuracies from channels of both the sensorimotor and forehead areas. These results suggest that motor imagery can be detected with a single channel not only from the traditional sensorimotor area but also from the forehead area. "
24921388,"Action potentials and local field potentials (LFPs) recorded in primary motor cortex contain information about the direction of movement. LFPs are assumed to be more robust to signal instabilities than action potentials, which makes LFPs, along with action potentials, a promising signal source for brain-computer interface applications. Still, relatively little research has directly compared the utility of LFPs to action potentials in decoding movement direction in human motor cortex. We conducted intracortical multi-electrode recordings in motor cortex of two persons (T2 and [S3]) as they performed a motor imagery task. We then compared the offline decoding performance of LFPs and spiking extracted from the same data recorded across a one-year period in each participant. We obtained offline prediction accuracy of movement direction and endpoint velocity in multiple LFP bands, with the best performance in the highest (200-400 Hz) LFP frequency band, presumably also containing low-pass filtered action potentials. Cross-frequency correlations of preferred directions and directional modulation index showed high similarity of directional information between action potential firing rates (spiking) and high frequency LFPs (70-400 Hz), and increasing disparity with lower frequency bands (0-7, 10-40 and 50-65 Hz). Spikes predicted the direction of intended movement more accurately than any individual LFP band, however combined decoding of all LFPs was statistically indistinguishable from spike-based performance. As the quality of spiking signals (i.e. signal amplitude) and the number of significantly modulated spiking units decreased, the offline decoding performance decreased 3.6[5.65]%/month (for T2 and [S3] respectively). The decrease in the number of significantly modulated LFP signals and their decoding accuracy followed a similar trend (2.4[2.85]%/month, ANCOVA, p = 0.27[0.03]). Field potentials provided comparable offline decoding performance to unsorted spikes. Thus, LFPs may provide useful external device control using current human intracortical recording technology.

24886610,"Event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) is a relative power decrease/increase of electroencephalogram (EEG) in a specific frequency band during physical motor execution and mental motor imagery, thus it is widely used for the brain-computer interface (BCI) purpose. However what the ERD really reflects and its frequency band specific role have not been agreed and are under investigation. Understanding the underlying mechanism which causes a significant ERD would be crucial to improve the reliability of the ERD-based BCI. We systematically investigated the relationship between conditions of actual repetitive hand movements and resulting ERD. Eleven healthy young participants were asked to close/open their right hand repetitively at three different speeds (Hold, 1/3 Hz, and 1 Hz) and four distinct motor loads (0, 2, 10, and 15 kgf). In each condition, participants repeated 20 experimental trials, each of which consisted of rest (8-10 s), preparation (1 s) and task (6 s) periods. Under the Hold condition, participants were instructed to keep clenching their hand (i.e., isometric contraction) during the task period. Throughout the experiment, EEG signals were recorded from left and right motor areas for offline data analysis. We obtained time courses of EEG power spectrum to discuss the modulation of mu and beta-ERD/ERS due to the task conditions. We confirmed salient mu-ERD (8-13 Hz) and slightly weak beta-ERD (14-30 Hz) on both hemispheres during repetitive hand grasping movements. According to a 3 × 4 ANOVA (speed × motor load), both mu and beta-ERD during the task period were significantly weakened under the Hold condition, whereas no significant difference in the kinetics levels and interaction effect was observed. This study investigates the effect of changes in kinematics and kinetics on resulting ERD during repetitive hand grasping movements. The experimental results suggest that the strength of ERD may reflect the time differentiation of hand postures in motor planning process or the variation of proprioception resulting from hand movements, rather than the motor command generated in the down stream, which recruits a group of motor neurons."
24839840,"Aiming at the issue of motor imagery electroencephalography (EEG) pattern recognition in the research of brain-computer interface (BCI), a power feature method based on discrete wavelet packet decomposition is proposed for the channels C3 and C4. Firstly, a six-border Butterworth filter is used to denoise the two-channel EEG signals. Secondly, two-channel EEG signals are decomposed to five levels using Daubechies wavelet and the fourth level and the fifth level are chosen to reconstruct the signals and compute its power feature. Finally, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is utilized to classify the feature and the Kappa value is utilized to measure the accuracy of the classifier. This method is applied to the standard dataset BCICIV_2b-gdf of BCI Competition 2008, and experimental results show that this method reflect the feature of event-related synchronization and event-related desynchronization obviously and it is an effective way to classify the EEG patterns in the research of BCI."
24836742,"Detection of motor imagery of hand/arm has been extensively studied for stroke rehabilitation. This paper firstly investigates the detection of motor imagery of swallow (MI-SW) and motor imagery of tongue protrusion (MI-Ton) in an attempt to find a novel solution for post-stroke dysphagia rehabilitation. Detection of MI-SW from a simple yet relevant modality such as MI-Ton is then investigated, motivated by the similarity in activation patterns between tongue movements and swallowing and there being fewer movement artifacts in performing tongue movements compared to swallowing. Novel features were extracted based on the coefficients of the dual-tree complex wavelet transform to build multiple training models for detecting MI-SW. The session-to-session classification accuracy was boosted by adaptively selecting the training model to maximize the ratio of between-classes distances versus within-class distances, using features of training and evaluation data. Our proposed method yielded averaged cross-validation (CV) classification accuracies of 70.89% and 73.79% for MI-SW and MI-Ton for ten healthy subjects, which are significantly better than the results from existing methods. In addition, averaged CV accuracies of 66.40% and 70.24% for MI-SW and MI-Ton were obtained for one stroke patient, demonstrating the detectability of MI-SW and MI-Ton from the idle state. Furthermore, averaged session-to-session classification accuracies of 72.08% and 70% were achieved for ten healthy subjects and one stroke patient using the MI-Ton model. These results and the subjectwise strong correlations in classification accuracies between MI-SW and MI-Ton demonstrated the feasibility of detecting MI-SW from MI-Ton models."
24835837,"Assimilating the diagnosis complete spinal cord injury (SCI) takes time and is not easy, as patients know that there is no 'cure' at the present time. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can facilitate daily living. However, inter-subject variability demands measurements with potential user groups and an understanding of how they differ to healthy users BCIs are more commonly tested with. Thus, a three-class motor imagery (MI) screening (left hand, right hand, feet) was performed with a group of 10 able-bodied and 16 complete spinal-cord-injured people (paraplegics, tetraplegics) with the objective of determining what differences were present between the user groups and how they would impact upon the ability of these user groups to interact with a BCI. Electrophysiological differences between patient groups and healthy users are measured in terms of sensorimotor rhythm deflections from baseline during MI, electroencephalogram microstate scalp maps and strengths of inter-channel phase synchronization. Additionally, using a common spatial pattern algorithm and a linear discriminant analysis classifier, the classification accuracy was calculated and compared between groups. It is seen that both patient groups (tetraplegic and paraplegic) have some significant differences in event-related desynchronization strengths, exhibit significant increases in synchronization and reach significantly lower accuracies (mean (M) = 66.1%) than the group of healthy subjects (M = 85.1%). The results demonstrate significant differences in electrophysiological correlates of motor control between healthy individuals and those individuals who stand to benefit most from BCI technology (individuals with SCI). They highlight the difficulty in directly translating results from healthy subjects to participants with SCI and the challenges that, therefore, arise in providing BCIs to such individuals."
24835634,"It is well known that to acquire sensorimotor (SMR)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) control requires a training period before users can achieve their best possible performances. Nevertheless, the effect of this training procedure on the cortical activity related to the mental imagery ability still requires investigation to be fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to gain insights into the effects of SMR-based BCI training on the cortical spectral activity associated with the performance of different mental imagery tasks. Linear cortical estimation and statistical brain mapping techniques were applied on high-density EEG data acquired from 18 healthy participants performing three different mental imagery tasks. Subjects were divided in two groups, one of BCI trained subjects, according to their previous exposure (at least six months before this study) to motor imagery-based BCI training, and one of subjects who were naive to any BCI paradigms. Cortical activation maps obtained for trained and naive subjects indicated different spectral and spatial activity patterns in response to the mental imagery tasks. Long-term effects of the previous SMR-based BCI training were observed on the motor cortical spectral activity specific to the BCI trained motor imagery task (simple hand movements) and partially generalized to more complex motor imagery task (playing tennis). Differently, mental imagery with spatial attention and memory content could elicit recognizable cortical spectral activity even in subjects completely naive to (BCI) training. The present findings contribute to our understanding of BCI technology usage and might be of relevance in those clinical conditions when training to master a BCI application is challenging or even not possible."
24835132,"In recent years, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have become mature enough to immensely benefit from the expertise and tools established in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). One of the core objectives in HCI research is the design of systems that provide a pleasurable user experience (UX). While the majority of BCI studies exclusively evaluate common efficiency measures such as classification accuracy and speed, single research groups have begun to look at further usability aspects such as ease of use, workload and learnability. However, these evaluation metrics only cover pragmatic aspects of UX while still not considering the hedonic quality of UX. In order to gain a holistic perspective on UX, hedonic quality aspects such as motivation and frustration were also taken into account for our evaluation of three BCI-driven interfaces, which were proposed to be used as a two-stage neuroprosthetic control within the EU project MUNDUS. At the first stage, one of six possible actions was selected and either confirmed or cancelled at the second stage. For the experiment, a solely event-related-potential-based interface (ERP-ERP) and two hybrid solutions were tested that were controlled by ERP and motor imagery (MI)--resulting in the two possible combinations: ERP selection/MI confirmation (ERP-MI) or MI selection/ERP confirmation (MI-ERP). Behavioural, subjective and encephalographic (EEG) data of 12 healthy subjects were collected during an online experiment with the three graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Results showed a significantly greater pragmatic quality (in terms of accuracy, efficiency, workload, use quality and learnability) for the ERP-ERP and ERP-MI GUIs in contrast to the MI-ERP GUI. Consequently, the MI-ERP GUI is least suited for use as a neuroprosthetic control. With respect to the comparison of the ERP-ERP and ERP-MI GUIs, no significant differences in pragmatic and hedonic quality of UX were found. Since throughout better results were obtained for the conventional approach and it was most preferred by the subjects, the ERP-ERP GUI seems more suitable for its deployment in actual end-users. Nevertheless, for individuals with stable MI patterns, the hybrid interface can be provided as an additional option of choice within the MUNDUS framework. Although the paramount goal in BCI research still remains the improvement of classification accuracy and communication speed, it is of significance to note that it is equally important for end-users to keep up their motivation and prevent frustration. By including pragmatic as well as hedonic quality aspects, this study is the first effort to gain a holistic perspective of the UX while interacting with BCI-driven assistive technology aimed at actual end-users. The broad-scale methodology provided valuable insights into the underlying dynamics causing the users' experience to differ across the GUIs. The results will be used to refine a BCI-driven neuroprosthesis and test it with end-users."
24834973,"We have developed a brain-computer interface (BCI) system based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with virtual reality feedback. The advantage of fMRI is the relatively high spatial resolution and the coverage of the whole brain; thus we expect that it may be used to explore novel BCI strategies, based on new types of mental activities. However, fMRI suffers from a low temporal resolution and an inherent delay, since it is based on a hemodynamic response rather than electrical signals. Thus, our objective in this paper was to explore whether subjects could perform a BCI task in a virtual environment using our system, and how their performance was affected by the delay. The subjects controlled an avatar by left-hand, right-hand and leg motion or imagery. The BCI classification is based on locating the regions of interest (ROIs) related with each of the motor classes, and selecting the ROI with maximum average values online. The subjects performed a cue-based task and a free-choice task, and the analysis includes evaluation of the performance as well as subjective reports. Six subjects performed the task with high accuracy when allowed to move their fingers and toes, and three subjects achieved high accuracy using imagery alone. In the cue-based task the accuracy was highest 8-12 s after the trigger, whereas in the free-choice task the subjects performed best when the feedback was provided 6 s after the trigger. We show that subjects are able to perform a navigation task in a virtual environment using an fMRI-based BCI, despite the hemodynamic delay. The same approach can be extended to other mental tasks and other brain areas."
24834047,"Prostheses for upper-limb amputees are currently controlled by either myoelectric or peripheral neural signals. Performance and dexterity of these devices is still limited, particularly when it comes to controlling hand function. Movement-related brain activity might serve as a complementary bio-signal for motor control of hand prosthesis. We introduced a methodology to implant a cortical interface without direct exposure of the brain surface in an upper-limb amputee. This bi-directional interface enabled us to explore the cortical physiology following long-term transhumeral amputation. In addition, we investigated neurofeedback of electrocorticographic brain activity related to the patient's motor imagery to open his missing hand, i.e., phantom hand movement, for real-time control of a virtual hand prosthesis. Both event-related brain activity and cortical stimulation revealed mutually overlapping cortical representations of the phantom hand. Phantom hand movements could be robustly classified and the patient required only three training sessions to gain reliable control of the virtual hand prosthesis in an online closed-loop paradigm that discriminated between hand opening and rest. Epidural implants may constitute a powerful and safe alternative communication pathway between the brain and external devices for upper-limb amputees, thereby facilitating the integrated use of different signal sources for more intuitive and specific control of multi-functional devices in clinical use."
24807028,"A novel neural information processing architecture inspired by quantum mechanics and incorporating the well-known Schrodinger wave equation is proposed in this paper. The proposed architecture referred to as recurrent quantum neural network (RQNN) can characterize a nonstationary stochastic signal as time-varying wave packets. A robust unsupervised learning algorithm enables the RQNN to effectively capture the statistical behavior of the input signal and facilitates the estimation of signal embedded in noise with unknown characteristics. The results from a number of benchmark tests show that simple signals such as dc, staircase dc, and sinusoidal signals embedded within high noise can be accurately filtered and particle swarm optimization can be employed to select model parameters. The RQNN filtering procedure is applied in a two-class motor imagery-based brain-computer interface where the objective was to filter electroencephalogram (EEG) signals before feature extraction and classification to increase signal separability. A two-step inner-outer fivefold cross-validation approach is utilized to select the algorithm parameters subject-specifically for nine subjects. It is shown that the subject-specific RQNN EEG filtering significantly improves brain-computer interface performance compared to using only the raw EEG or Savitzky-Golay filtered EEG across multiple sessions.

24797225,"For a self-paced motor imagery based brain-computer interface (BCI), the system should be able to recognize the occurrence of a motor imagery, as well as the type of the motor imagery. However, because of the difficulty of detecting the occurrence of a motor imagery, general motor imagery based BCI studies have been focusing on the cued motor imagery paradigm. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid BCI system that uses near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) systems together to achieve online self-paced motor imagery based BCI. We designed a unique sensor frame that records NIRS and EEG simultaneously for the realization of our system. Based on this hybrid system, we proposed a novel analysis method that detects the occurrence of a motor imagery with the NIRS system, and classifies its type with the EEG system. An online experiment demonstrated that our hybrid system had a true positive rate of about 88%, a false positive rate of 7% with an average response time of 10.36 s. As far as we know, there is no report that explored hemodynamic brain switch for self-paced motor imagery based BCI with hybrid EEG and NIRS system. From our experimental results, our hybrid system showed enough reliability for using in a practical self-paced motor imagery based BCI."
24756025,"Electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor imagery (MI) brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has the potential to restore motor function by inducing activity-dependent brain plasticity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of an EEG-based MI BCI system coupled with MIT-Manus shoulder-elbow robotic feedback (BCI-Manus) for subjects with chronic stroke with upper-limb hemiparesis. In this single-blind, randomized trial, 26 hemiplegic subjects (Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery After Stroke [FMMA] score, 4-40; 16 men; mean age, 51.4 years; mean stroke duration, 297.4 days), prescreened with the ability to use the MI BCI, were randomly allocated to BCI-Manus or Manus therapy, lasting 18 hours over 4 weeks. Efficacy was measured using upper-extremity FMMA scores at weeks 0, 2, 4 and 12. ElEG data from subjects allocated to BCI-Manus were quantified using the revised brain symmetry index (rBSI) and analyzed for correlation with the improvements in FMMA score. Eleven and 15 subjects underwent BCI-Manus and Manus therapy, respectively. One subject in the Manus group dropped out. Mean total FMMA scores at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 12 weeks improved for both groups: 26.3±10.3, 27.4±12.0, 30.8±13.8, and 31.5±13.5 for BCI-Manus and 26.6±18.9, 29.9±20.6, 32.9±21.4, and 33.9±20.2 for Manus, with no intergroup differences (P=.51). More subjects attained further gains in FMMA scores at week 12 from BCI-Manus (7 of 11 [63.6%]) than Manus (5 of 14 [35.7%]). A negative correlation was found between the rBSI and FMMA score improvement (P=.044). BCI-Manus therapy was well tolerated and not associated with adverse events. In conclusion, BCI-Manus therapy is effective and safe for arm rehabilitation after severe poststroke hemiparesis. Motor gains were comparable to those attained with intensive robotic therapy (1,040 repetitions/session) despite reduced arm exercise repetitions using EEG-based MI-triggered robotic feedback (136 repetitions/session). The correlation of rBSI with motor improvements suggests that the rBSI can be used as a prognostic measure for BCI-based stroke rehabilitation."
24737114,"While brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for communication have reached considerable technical maturity, there is still a great need for state-of-the-art evaluation by the end-users outside laboratory environments. To achieve this primary objective, it is necessary to augment a BCI with a series of components that allow end-users to type text effectively. This work presents the clinical evaluation of a motor imagery (MI) BCI text-speller, called BrainTree, by six severely disabled end-users and ten able-bodied users. Additionally, we define a generic model of code-based BCI applications, which serves as an analytical tool for evaluation and design. We show that all users achieved remarkable usability and efficiency outcomes in spelling. Furthermore, our model-based analysis highlights the added value of human-computer interaction techniques and hybrid BCI error-handling mechanisms, and reveals the effects of BCI performances on usability and efficiency in code-based applications. This study demonstrates the usability potential of code-based MI spellers, with BrainTree being the first to be evaluated by a substantial number of end-users, establishing them as a viable, competitive alternative to other popular BCI spellers. Another major outcome of our model-based analysis is the derivation of a 80% minimum command accuracy requirement for successful code-based application control, revising upwards previous estimates attempted in the literature."
24737062,"Effective motor imagery performance, seen as strong suppression of the sensorimotor rhythm, is the key element in motor imagery therapy. Therefore, optimization of methods to classify whether the subject is performing the imagery task is a prerequisite. An optimal classification method should have high performance accuracy and use a small number of channels. We investigated the additional benefit of the common spatial pattern filtering (CSP) to a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier, for different channel configurations. Ten hemispheric acute stroke patients and 11 healthy subjects were included. EEGs were recorded using 60 channels. The classifier was trained with a motor execution task. For both healthy controls and patients, analysis of recordings was initially limited to 3 and 11 electrodes recording from the motor cortex area, and later repeated using 45 electrodes. No significant improvement on the addition of CSP to LDA was found (in both cases, the area under the receiving operating characteristic (AU-ROC) ≈ 0.70 (acceptable)). We then repeated the LDA+CSP method on recordings of 45 electrodes, since the use of imagery neuronal circuits may well extend beyond the motor area. AU-ROC rose to 0.90, but no virtual 'most responsible' electrode was observed. Finally, in mild-to-moderate stroke patients we could successfully use the EEG data recorded from the healthy hemisphere to train the classifier (AU-ROC ≈ 0.70). Including only the channels on the unaffected motor cortex is sufficient to train a classifier."
24713576,"Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are developed to translate brain waves into machine instructions for external devices control. Recently, hybrid BCI systems are proposed for the multi-degree control of a real wheelchair to improve the systematical efficiency of traditional BCIs. However, it is difficult for existing hybrid BCIs to implement the multi-dimensional control in one command cycle. This paper proposes a novel hybrid BCI system that combines motor imagery (MI)-based bio-signals and steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) to control the speed and direction of a real wheelchair synchronously. Furthermore, a hybrid modalities-based switch is firstly designed to turn on/off the control system of the wheelchair. Two experiments were performed to assess the proposed BCI system. One was implemented for training and the other one conducted a wheelchair control task in the real environment. All subjects completed these tasks successfully and no collisions occurred in the real wheelchair control experiment. The protocol of our BCI gave much more control commands than those of previous MI and SSVEP-based BCIs. Comparing with other BCI wheelchair systems, the superiority reflected by the index of path length optimality ratio validated the high efficiency of our control strategy. The results validated the efficiency of our hybrid BCI system to control the direction and speed of a real wheelchair as well as the reliability of hybrid signals-based switch control."
24694169,"There have been many attempts to design brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for wheelchair control based on steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) during motor imagery (MI) tasks, P300 evoked potential, and some hybrid signals. However, those BCI systems cannot implement the wheelchair navigation flexibly and effectively. In this paper, we propose a hybrid BCI scheme based on two-class MI and four-class SSVEP tasks. It cannot only provide multi-degree control for its user, but also allow the user implement the different types of commands in parallel. In order for the subject to learn the hybrid mental strategies effectively, we design a visual and auditory cues and feedback-based training paradigm. Furthermore, an algorithm based on entropy of classification probabilities is proposed to detect intentional control (IC) state for hybrid tasks, and ensure that multi-degree control commands are accurately and quickly generated. The experiment results attest to the efficiency and flexibility of the hybrid BCI for wheelchair control in the real-world. "
24691154,"Imagination of movement can be used as a control method for a brain-computer interface (BCI) allowing communication for the physically impaired. Visual feedback within such a closed loop system excludes those with visual problems and hence there is a need for alternative sensory feedback pathways. In the context of substituting the visual channel for the auditory channel, this study aims to add to the limited evidence that it is possible to substitute visual feedback for its auditory equivalent and assess the impact this has on BCI performance. Secondly, the study aims to determine for the first time if the type of auditory feedback method influences motor imagery performance significantly. Auditory feedback is presented using a stepped approach of single (mono), double (stereo), and multiple (vector base amplitude panning as an audio game) loudspeaker arrangements. Visual feedback involves a ball-basket paradigm and a spaceship game. Each session consists of either auditory or visual feedback only with runs of each type of feedback presentation method applied in each session. Results from seven subjects across five sessions of each feedback type (visual, auditory) (10 sessions in total) show that auditory feedback is a suitable substitute for the visual equivalent and that there are no statistical differences in the type of auditory feedback presented across five sessions.

24686231,"In this paper, we present a brain-computer interface (BCI) driven motorized ankle-foot orthosis (BCI-MAFO), intended for stroke rehabilitation, and we demonstrate its efficacy in inducing cortical neuroplasticity in healthy subjects with a short intervention procedure (∼15 min). This system detects imaginary dorsiflexion movements within a short latency from scalp EEG through the analysis of movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs). A manifold-based method, called locality preserving projection, detected the motor imagery online with a true positive rate of 73.0 ± 10.3%. Each detection triggered the MAFO to elicit a passive dorsiflexion. In nine healthy subjects, the size of the motor-evoked potential (MEP) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation increased significantly immediately following and 30 min after the cessation of this BCI-MAFO intervention for ∼15 min ( p = 0.009 and , respectively), indicating neural plasticity. In four subjects, the size of the short latency stretch reflex component did not change following the intervention, suggesting that the site of the induced plasticity was cortical. All but one subject also performed two control conditions where they either imagined only or where the MAFO was randomly triggered. Both of these control conditions resulted in no significant changes in MEP size (p = 0.38 and p = 0.15). The proposed system provides a fast and effective approach for inducing cortical plasticity through BCI and has potential in motor function rehabilitation following stroke."
24672456,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) improves motor learning and can affect emotional processing and attention. However, it is unclear whether learned electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-machine interface (BMI) control during tDCS is feasible, how application of transcranial electric currents during BMI control would interfere with feature-extraction of physiological brain signals and how it affects brain control performance. Here we tested this combination and evaluated stimulation-dependent artifacts across different EEG frequencies and stability of motor imagery-based BMI control. Ten healthy volunteers were invited to two BMI-sessions, each comprising two 60-trial blocks. During the trials, learned desynchronization of mu-rhythms (8-15 Hz) associated with motor imagery (MI) recorded over C4 was translated into online cursor movements on a computer screen. During block 2, either sham (session A) or anodal tDCS (session B) was applied at 1 mA with the stimulation electrode placed 1 cm anterior of C4. tDCS was associated with a significant signal power increase in the lower frequencies most evident in the signal spectrum of the EEG channel closest to the stimulation electrode. Stimulation-dependent signal power increase exhibited a decay of 12 dB per decade, leaving frequencies above 9 Hz unaffected. Analysis of BMI control performance did not indicate a difference between blocks and tDCS conditions. Application of tDCS during learned EEG-based self-regulation of brain oscillations above 9 Hz is feasible and safe, and might improve applicability of BMI systems."
24653694,"Analysis of brain connectivity has become an important research tool in neuroscience. Connectivity can be estimated between cortical sources reconstructed from the electroencephalogram (EEG). Such analysis often relies on trial averaging to obtain reliable results. However, some applications such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) require single-trial estimation methods. In this paper, we present SCoT-a source connectivity toolbox for Python. This toolbox implements routines for blind source decomposition and connectivity estimation with the MVARICA approach. Additionally, a novel extension called CSPVARICA is available for labeled data. SCoT estimates connectivity from various spectral measures relying on vector autoregressive (VAR) models. Optionally, these VAR models can be regularized to facilitate ill posed applications such as single-trial fitting. We demonstrate basic usage of SCoT on motor imagery (MI) data. Furthermore, we show simulation results of utilizing SCoT for feature extraction in a BCI application. These results indicate that CSPVARICA and correct regularization can significantly improve MI classification. While SCoT was mainly designed for application in BCIs, it contains useful tools for other areas of neuroscience. SCoT is a software package that (1) brings combined source decomposition and connectivtiy estimation to the open Python platform, and (2) offers tools for single-trial connectivity estimation. The source code is released under the MIT license and is available online at github.com/SCoT-dev/SCoT. "
24634650,"Motor recovery after stroke is an unsolved challenge despite intensive rehabilitation training programs. Brain stimulation techniques have been explored in addition to traditional rehabilitation training to increase the excitability of the stimulated motor cortex. This modulation of cortical excitability augments the response to afferent input during motor exercises, thereby enhancing skilled motor learning by long-term potentiation-like plasticity. Recent approaches examined brain stimulation applied concurrently with voluntary movements to induce more specific use-dependent neural plasticity during motor training for neurorehabilitation. Unfortunately, such approaches are not applicable for the many severely affected stroke patients lacking residual hand function. These patients require novel activity-dependent stimulation paradigms based on intrinsic brain activity. Here, we report on such brain state-dependent stimulation (BSDS) combined with haptic feedback provided by a robotic hand orthosis. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex and haptic feedback to the hand were controlled by sensorimotor desynchronization during motor-imagery and applied within a brain-machine interface (BMI) environment in one healthy subject and one patient with severe hand paresis in the chronic phase after stroke. BSDS significantly increased the excitability of the stimulated motor cortex in both healthy and post-stroke conditions, an effect not observed in non-BSDS protocols. This feasibility study suggests that closing the loop between intrinsic brain state, cortical stimulation and haptic feedback provides a novel neurorehabilitation strategy for stroke patients lacking residual hand function, a proposal that warrants further investigation in a larger cohort of stroke patients.

24608682,"Combining electrophysiological and hemodynamic features is a novel approach for improving current performance of brain switches based on sensorimotor rhythms (SMR). This study was conducted with a dual purpose: to test the feasibility of using a combined electroencephalogram/functional near-infrared spectroscopy (EEG-fNIRS) SMR-based brain switch in patients with tetraplegia, and to examine the performance difference between motor imagery and motor attempt for this user group. A general improvement was found when using both EEG and fNIRS features for classification as compared to using the single-modality EEG classifier, with average classification rates of 79% for attempted movement and 70% for imagined movement. For the control group, rates of 87% and 79% were obtained, respectively, where the ""attempted movement"" condition was replaced with ""actual movement."" A combined EEG-fNIRS system might be especially beneficial for users who lack sufficient control of current EEG-based brain switches. The average classification performance in the patient group for attempted movement was significantly higher than for imagined movement using the EEG-only as well as the combined classifier, arguing for the case of a paradigm shift in current brain switch research.

Time-frequency representation is constructed by means of continuous wavelet transform from EEG signals and then weighted with 2-sample t-statistics, which are also used to automatically select the area of interest in advance. Finally, normalized cross-correlation is used to discriminate the test MI data.

24551050,"Recently, spatio-temporal filtering to enhance decoding for Brain-Computer-Interfacing (BCI) has become increasingly popular. In this work, we discuss a novel, fully Bayesian-and thereby probabilistic-framework, called Bayesian Spatio-Spectral Filter Optimization (BSSFO) and apply it to a large data set of 80 non-invasive EEG-based BCI experiments. Across the full frequency range, the BSSFO framework allows to analyze which spatio-spectral parameters are common and which ones differ across the subject population. As expected, large variability of brain rhythms is observed between subjects. We have clustered subjects according to similarities in their corresponding spectral characteristics from the BSSFO model, which is found to reflect their BCI performances well. In BCI, a considerable percentage of subjects is unable to use a BCI for communication, due to their missing ability to modulate their brain rhythms-a phenomenon sometimes denoted as BCI-illiteracy or inability. Predicting individual subjects' performance preceding the actual, time-consuming BCI-experiment enhances the usage of BCIs, e.g., by detecting users with BCI inability. This work additionally contributes by using the novel BSSFO method to predict the BCI-performance using only 2 minutes and 3 channels of resting-state EEG data recorded before the actual BCI-experiment. Specifically, by grouping the individual frequency characteristics we have nicely classified them into the subject 'prototypes' (like μ - or β -rhythm type subjects) or users without ability to communicate with a BCI, and then by further building a linear regression model based on the grouping we could predict subjects' performance with the maximum correlation coefficient of 0.581 with the performance later seen in the actual BCI session.

24523855,"The ability to decode an individual's intentions in real time has long been a 'holy grail' of research on human volition. For example, a reliable method could be used to improve scientific study of voluntary action by allowing external probe stimuli to be delivered at different moments during development of intention and action. Several Brain Computer Interface applications have used motor imagery of repetitive actions to achieve this goal. These systems are relatively successful, but only if the intention is sustained over a period of several seconds; much longer than the timescales identified in psychophysiological studies for normal preparation for voluntary action. We have used a combination of sensorimotor rhythms and motor imagery training to decode intentions in a single-trial cued-response paradigm similar to those used in human and non-human primate motor control research. Decoding accuracy of over 0.83 was achieved with twelve participants. With this approach, we could decode intentions to move the left or right hand at sub-second timescales, both for instructed choices instructed by an external stimulus and for free choices generated intentionally by the participant. The implications for volition are considered. "
24440135,"Motor imagery (MI) tasks classification provides an important basis for designing brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. If the MI tasks are reliably distinguished through identifying typical patterns in electroencephalography (EEG) data, a motor disabled people could communicate with a device by composing sequences of these mental states. In our earlier study, we developed a cross-correlation based logistic regression (CC-LR) algorithm for the classification of MI tasks for BCI applications, but its performance was not satisfactory. This study develops a modified version of the CC-LR algorithm exploring a suitable feature set that can improve the performance. The modified CC-LR algorithm uses the C3 electrode channel (in the international 10-20 system) as a reference channel for the cross-correlation (CC) technique and applies three diverse feature sets separately, as the input to the logistic regression (LR) classifier. The present algorithm investigates which feature set is the best to characterize the distribution of MI tasks based EEG data. This study also provides an insight into how to select a reference channel for the CC technique with EEG signals considering the anatomical structure of the human brain. The proposed algorithm is compared with eight of the most recently reported well-known methods including the BCI III Winner algorithm. The findings of this study indicate that the modified CC-LR algorithm has potential to improve the identification performance of MI tasks in BCI systems. The results demonstrate that the proposed technique provides a classification improvement over the existing methods tested. "
24429072,"In the past 3 decades, interest has increased in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology as a tool for assisting, augmenting, and rehabilitating sensorimotor functions in clinical populations. Initially designed as an assistive device for partial or total body impairments, BCI systems have since been explored as a possible adjuvant therapy in the rehabilitation of patients who have had a stroke. In particular, BCI systems incorporating a robotic manipulanda to passively manipulate affected limbs have been studied. These systems can use a range of invasive (ie, intracranial implanted electrodes) or noninvasive neurophysiologic recording techniques (ie, electroencephalography [EEG], near-infrared spectroscopy, and magnetoencephalography) to establish communication links between the brain and the BCI system. Trials are most commonly performed on EEG-based BCI in comparison with the other techniques because of its high temporal resolution, relatively low setup costs, portability, and noninvasive nature. EEG-based BCI detects event-related desynchronization/synchronization in sensorimotor oscillatory rhythms associated with motor imagery (MI), which in turn drives the BCI. Previous evidence suggests that the process of MI preferentially activates sensorimotor regions similar to actual task performance and that repeated practice of MI can induce plasticity changes in the brain. It is therefore postulated that the combination of MI and BCI may augment rehabilitation gains in patients who have had a stroke by activating corticomotor networks via MI and providing sensory feedback from the affected limb using end-effector robots. In this review we examine the current literature surrounding the feasibility of EEG-based MI-BCI systems in stroke rehabilitation. We also discuss the limitations of using EEG-based MI-BCI in patients who have had a stroke and suggest possible solutions to overcome these limitations. "
24401829,"Mental practice using motor imagery of limb movement may facilitate motor recovery in persons who have experienced cerebrovascular accident (CVA). However, the lack of a feedback mechanism that can monitor the quality of the motor imagery affects patients' engagement and motivation to participate in the mental practice training program. This study investigates the effect of novel real-time motor imagery-associated cortical activity feedback on motor imagery-based mental practice training. Ten healthy volunteers were randomly assigned into intervention and control groups. Both groups participated in a five-visit motor imagery-based mental practice training program managed over a period of two months. The intervention group received mental practice training with real-time feedback of movement-associated cortical activity-beta band (16-28 Hz) event-related desynchronization (ERD) in electroencephalography (EEG), using a novel custom-made brain-computer interface (BCI) system. The control group received the mental practice training program without EEG cortical feedback. Motor excitability was assessed by measuring the frequency power magnitude of the EEG rhythmic activity associated with physical execution of wrist extension before and after the motor imagery-based mental practice training. The EEG frequency power magnitude associated with the physical execution of wrist extension was significantly lower (i.e. more desynchronized) after the mental practice training in the intervention group that received real-time cortical feedback (P < 0.05), whereas no significant difference in EEG frequency power magnitude associated with the physical execution of wrist extension was observed before and after mental practice training in the control group who did not receive feedback. The mental practice training program with motor imagery-associated cortical feedback facilitated motor excitability during the production of voluntary motor control. Motor imagery-based mental practice training with movement-associated cortical activity feedback may provide an effective strategy to facilitate motor recovery in brain injury patients, particularly during the early rehabilitation stage when full participation in physical and occupational therapy programs may not be possible due to excessive motor weakness."
24388403,"We sought to determine whether the sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) elicited during motor imagery (MI) of complex and familiar actions could be more reliably detected with electroencephalography (EEG), and subsequently classified on a single-trial basis, than those elicited during relatively simpler imagined actions. Groups of healthy volunteers, including experienced pianists and ice hockey players, performed MI of varying complexity and familiarity. Their electroencephalograms were recorded and compared using brain-computer interface (BCI) approaches and spectral analyses. Relative to simple MI, significantly more participants produced classifiable SMR for complex MI. During MI of performance of a complex musical piece, the EEG of the experienced pianists was classified significantly more accurately than during MI of performance of a simpler musical piece. The accuracy of EEG classification was also significantly more sustained during complex MI. MI of complex actions results in EEG responses that are more reliably classified for more individuals than MI of relatively simpler actions, and familiarity with actions enhances these responses in some cases. The accuracy of SMR-based BCIs in non-communicative patients may be improved by employing familiar and complex actions. Increased sensitivity to MI may also improve diagnostic accuracy for severely brain-injured patients in a vegetative state."
26271130,"A novel augmented complex-valued common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is introduced in order to cater for general complex signals with noncircular probability distributions. This is a typical case in multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG), due to the power difference or correlation between the data channels, yet current methods only cater for a very restrictive class of circular data. The proposed complex-valued CSP algorithms account for the generality of complex noncircular data, by virtue of the use of augmented complex statistics and the strong-uncorrelating transform (SUT). Depending on the degree of power difference of complex signals, the analysis and simulations show that the SUT based algorithm maximizes the inter-class difference between two motor imagery tasks. Simulations on both synthetic noncircular sources and motor imagery experiments using real-world EEG support the approach. "
24367322,"While brain computer interface (BCI) can be employed with patients and healthy subjects, there are problems that must be resolved before BCI can be useful to the public. In the most popular motor imagery (MI) BCI system, a significant number of target users (called ""BCI-Illiterates"") cannot modulate their neuronal signals sufficiently to use the BCI system. This causes performance variability among subjects and even among sessions within a subject. The mechanism of such BCI-Illiteracy and possible solutions still remain to be determined. Gamma oscillation is known to be involved in various fundamental brain functions, and may play a role in MI. In this study, we investigated the association of gamma activity with MI performance among subjects. Ten simultaneous MEG/EEG experiments were conducted; MI performance for each was estimated by EEG data, and the gamma activity associated with BCI performance was investigated with MEG data. Our results showed that gamma activity had a high positive correlation with MI performance in the prefrontal area. This trend was also found across sessions within one subject. In conclusion, gamma rhythms generated in the prefrontal area appear to play a critical role in BCI performance. "
24348740,"Common spatial pattern (CSP) is one of the most popular and effective feature extraction methods for motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (BCI), but the inherent drawback of CSP is that the estimation of the covariance matrices is sensitive to noise. In this work, local temporal correlation (LTC) information was introduced to further improve the covariance matrices estimation (LTCCSP). Compared to the Euclidean distance used in a previous CSP variant named local temporal CSP (LTCSP), the correlation may be a more reasonable metric to measure the similarity of activated spatial patterns existing in motor imagery period. Numerical comparisons among CSP, LTCSP, and LTCCSP were quantitatively conducted on the simulated datasets by adding outliers to Dataset IVa of BCI Competition III and Dataset IIa of BCI Competition IV, respectively. Results showed that LTCCSP achieves the highest average classification accuracies in all the outliers occurrence frequencies. The application of the three methods to the EEG dataset recorded in our laboratory also demonstrated that LTCCSP achieves the highest average accuracy. The above results consistently indicate that LTCCSP would be a promising method for practical motor imagery BCI application. "
24333753,"The improvement of the resolution of brain signal and the ability to control external device has been the most important goal in BMI research field. This paper describes a non-invasive brain-actuated manipulator experiment, which defined a paradigm for the motion control of a serial manipulator based on motor imagery and shared control. The techniques of component selection, spatial filtering and classification of motor imagery were involved. Small-world neural network (SWNN) was used to classify five brain states. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed classifier, we replace the SWNN classifier by a radial basis function (RBF) networks neural network, a standard multi-layered feed-forward backpropagation network (SMN) and a multi-SVM classifier, with the same features for the classification. The results also indicate that the proposed classifier achieves a 3.83% improvement over the best results of other classifiers. We proposed a shared control method consisting of two control patterns to expand the control of BMI from the software angle. The job of path building for reaching the 'end' point was designated as an assessment task. We recorded all paths contributed by subjects and picked up relevant parameters as evaluation coefficients. With the assistance of two control patterns and series of machine learning algorithms, the proposed BMI originally achieved the motion control of a manipulator in the whole workspace. According to experimental results, we confirmed the feasibility of the proposed BMI method for 3D motion control of a manipulator using EEG during motor imagery. "

Restoring able-body-like ambulation in this patient population can potentially reduce the incidence of these medical co-morbidities, in addition to increasing independence and quality of life. However, no biomedical solution exists that can reverse this loss of neurological function, and hence novel methods are needed. Brain-computer interface (BCI) controlled lower extremity prostheses may constitute one such novel approach. One able-bodied subject and one subject with paraplegia due to SCI underwent electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings while engaged in alternating epochs of idling and walking kinesthetic motor imagery (KMI). These data were analyzed to generate an EEG prediction model for online BCI operation. A commercial robotic gait orthosis (RoGO) system (suspended over a treadmill) was interfaced with the BCI computer to allow for computerized control. The subjects were then tasked to perform five, 5-min-long online sessions where they ambulated using the BCI-RoGO system as prompted by computerized cues. The performance of this system was assessed with cross-correlation analysis, and omission and false alarm rates. The offline accuracy of the EEG prediction model averaged 86.30% across both subjects (chance: 50%). The cross-correlation between instructional cues and the BCI-RoGO walking epochs averaged across all subjects and all sessions was 0.812 ± 0.048 (p-value <10(-4)). Also, there were on average 0.8 false alarms per session and no omissions. These results provide preliminary evidence that restoring brain-controlled ambulation after SCI is feasible. Future work will test the function of this system in a population of subjects with SCI. If successful, this may justify the future development of BCI-controlled lower extremity prostheses for free overground walking for those with complete motor SCI. Finally, this system can also be applied to incomplete motor SCI, where it could lead to improved neurological outcomes beyond those of standard physiotherapy."
24319425,"Motor imagery (MI) is the mental performance of movement without muscle activity. It is generally accepted that MI and motor performance have similar physiological mechanisms. To investigate the activity and excitability of cortical motor areas during MI in subjects who were previously trained with an MI-based brain-computer interface (BCI). Eleven healthy volunteers without neurological impairments (mean age, 36 years; range: 24-68 years) were either trained with an MI-based BCI (BCI-trained, n = 5) or received no BCI training (n = 6, controls). Subjects imagined grasping in a blocked paradigm task with alternating rest and task periods. For evaluating the activity and excitability of cortical motor areas we used functional MRI and navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS). fMRI revealed activation in Brodmann areas 3 and 6, the cerebellum, and the thalamus during MI in all subjects. The primary motor cortex was activated only in BCI-trained subjects. The associative zones of activation were larger in non-trained subjects. During MI, motor evoked potentials recorded from two of the three targeted muscles were significantly higher only in BCI-trained subjects. The motor threshold decreased (median = 17%) during MI, which was also observed only in BCI-trained subjects. Previous BCI training increased motor cortex excitability during MI. These data may help to improve BCI applications, including rehabilitation of patients with cerebral palsy."
24302929,"For efficient decoding of brain activities in analyzing brain function with an application to brain machine interfacing (BMI), we address a problem of how to determine spatial weights (spatial patterns), bandpass filters (frequency patterns), and time windows (time patterns) by utilizing electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. To find these parameters, we develop a data-driven criterion that is a natural extension of the so-called common spatial patterns (CSP) that are known to be effective features in BMI. We show that the proposed criterion can be optimized by an alternating procedure to achieve fast convergence. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively extract discriminative features for a motor imagery-based BMI. "
24292005,"By progression of the disease, motor neurons degenerate in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) eventually lose nearly all voluntary muscles in the body. They are awake and aware but cannot move or communicate (locked-in state). Since the function of the brain is preserved, one possible measure to support their communication is to interpret their motor intention by decoding (deciphering) brain signals and present it with external devices. This technology called ""brain-machine interface (BMI)"" is now close to clinical use in Japan and USA.In our system, we record electrocorticogram (ECoG) obtained with subudural electrodes during their motor imagery, decode it and determine the movement they intended. So far, one patient of ALS with severe paralysis, implanted with this electrodes, successfully operated the PC communication tool only by thinking. "
24282545,"Current research aims at identifying voluntary brain activation in patients who are behaviorally diagnosed as being unconscious, but are able to perform commands by modulating their brain activity patterns. This involves machine learning techniques and feature extraction methods such as applied in brain computer interfaces. In this study, we try to answer the question if features/classification methods which show advantages in healthy participants are also accurate when applied to data of patients with disorders of consciousness. A sample of healthy participants (N = 22), patients in a minimally conscious state (MCS; N = 5), and with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS; N = 9) was examined with a motor imagery task which involved imagery of moving both hands and an instruction to hold both hands firm. We extracted a set of 20 features from the electroencephalogram and used linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbor classification, and support vector machines (SVM) as classification methods. In healthy participants, the best classification accuracies were seen with coherences (mean = .79; range = .53-.94) and power spectra (mean = .69; range = .40-.85). The coherence patterns in healthy participants did not match the expectation of central modulated [Formula: see text]-rhythm. Instead, coherence involved mainly frontal regions. In healthy participants, the best classification tool was SVM. Five patients had at least one feature-classifier outcome with p[Formula: see text]0.05 (none of which were coherence or power spectra), though none remained significant after false-discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons. The present work suggests the use of coherences in patients with disorders of consciousness because they show high reliability among healthy subjects and patient groups. However, feature extraction and classification is a challenging task in unresponsive patients because there is no ground truth to validate the results."
24280103,"Stroke is one of the most common disorders among the elderly. A practical problem in stroke rehabilitation systems is that how to separate motor imagery patterns from electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. There is a sharp decline in performance of these systems when classical algorithms, such as Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), are directly applied on stroke patients. We propose a tensor-based scheme to detect motor imagery EEG patterns in spatial-spectral-temporal domain directly from multidimensional EEG constructed by wavelet transform method. Discriminative motor imagery EEG patterns are obtained by Fisher score strategy. Furthermore, the most contributed channel groups and frequency bands are selected from these patterns and utilized as prior knowledge for the following motor imagery tasks. We evaluate our scheme based on EEG datasets recorded from stroke patients. The results show that our method outperforms five other traditional methods in both online and offline recognition performance. Unlike the existing methods, motor imagery EEG patterns in spatial-spectral-temporal domain are simultaneously obtained by our method, preserving the structural information of the multi-channel time-varying EEG. Our scheme is encouraged to be transferred to some other practical rehabilitation applications for its better performance."
24278339,"In most brain computer interface (BCI) systems, some target users have significant difficulty in using BCI systems. Such target users are called 'BCI-illiterate'. This phenomenon has been poorly investigated, and a clear understanding of the BCI-illiteracy mechanism or a solution to this problem has not been reported to date. In this study, we sought to demonstrate the neurophysiological differences between two groups (literate, illiterate) with a total of 52 subjects. We investigated recordings under non-task related state (NTS) which is collected during subject is relaxed with eyes open. We found that high theta and low alpha waves were noticeable in the BCI-illiterate relative to the BCI-literate people. Furthermore, these high theta and low alpha wave patterns were preserved across different mental states, such as NTS, resting before motor imagery (MI), and MI states, even though the spatial distribution of both BCI-illiterate and BCI-literate groups did not differ. From these findings, an effective strategy for pre-screening subjects for BCI illiteracy has been determined, and a performance factor that reflects potential user performance has been proposed using a simple combination of band powers. Our proposed performance factor gave an r = 0.59 (r(2) = 0.34) in a correlation analysis with BCI performance and yielded as much as r = 0.70 (r(2) = 0.50) when seven outliers were rejected during the evaluation of whole data (N = 61), including BCI competition datasets (N = 9). These findings may be directly applicable to online BCI systems."
24235291,"A hybrid modality brain-computer interface (BCI) is proposed in this paper, which combines motor imagery with selective sensation to enhance the discrimination between left and right mental tasks, e.g., the classification between left/ right stimulation sensation and right/ left motor imagery. In this paradigm, wearable vibrotactile rings are used to stimulate both the skin on both wrists. Subjects are required to perform the mental tasks according to the randomly presented cues (i.e., left hand motor imagery, right hand motor imagery, left stimulation sensation or right stimulation sensation). Two-way ANOVA statistical analysis showed a significant group effect (F (2,20) = 7.17, p = 0.0045), and the Benferroni-corrected multiple comparison test (with α = 0.05) showed that the hybrid modality group is 11.13% higher on average than the motor imagery group, and 10.45% higher than the selective sensation group. The hybrid modality experiment exhibits potentially wider spread usage within ten subjects crossed 70% accuracy, followed by four subjects in motor imagery and five subjects in selective sensation. Six subjects showed statistically significant improvement ( Benferroni-corrected) in hybrid modality in comparison with both motor imagery and selective sensation. Furthermore, among subjects having difficulties in both motor imagery and selective sensation, the hybrid modality improves their performance to 90% accuracy. The proposed hybrid modality BCI has demonstrated clear benefits for those poorly performing BCI users. Not only does the requirement of motor and sensory anticipation in this hybrid modality provide basic function of BCI for communication and control, it also has the potential for enhancing the rehabilitation during motor recovery.

24204705,"The common spatial pattern analysis (CSP), a frequently utilized feature extraction method in brain-computer-interface applications, is believed to be time-invariant and sensitive to noises, mainly due to an inherent shortcoming of purely relying on spatial filtering. Therefore, temporal/spectral filtering which can be very effective to counteract the unfavorable influence of noises is usually used as a supplement. This work integrates the CSP spatial filters with complex channel-specific finite impulse response (FIR) filters in a natural and intuitive manner. Each hybrid spatial-FIR filter is of high-order, data-driven and is unique to its corresponding channel. They are derived by introducing multiple time delays and regularization into conventional CSP. The general framework of the method follows that of CSP but performs better, as proven in single-trial classification tasks like event-related potential detection and motor imagery. "
24187241,"We present a systematic approach that enables online modification/adaptation of robot assisted rehabilitation exercises by continuously monitoring intention levels of patients utilizing an electroencephalogram (EEG) based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). In particular, we use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to classify event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) patterns associated with motor imagery; however, instead of providing a binary classification output, we utilize posterior probabilities extracted from LDA classifier as the continuous-valued outputs to control a rehabilitation robot. Passive velocity field control (PVFC) is used as the underlying robot controller to map instantaneous levels of motor imagery during the movement to the speed of contour following tasks. In other words, PVFC changes the speed of contour following tasks with respect to intention levels of motor imagery. PVFC also allows decoupling of the task and the speed of the task from each other, and ensures coupled stability of the overall robot patient system. The proposed framework is implemented on AssistOn-Mobile--a series elastic actuator based on a holonomic mobile platform, and feasibility studies with healthy volunteers have been conducted test effectiveness of the proposed approach. Giving patients online control over the speed of the task, the proposed approach ensures active involvement of patients throughout exercise routines and has the potential to increase the efficacy of robot assisted therapies."
24165805,"Brain-computer interfacing (BCI) has been the most researched technology in neuroprosthesis in the last two decades. Feature extractors and classifiers play an important role in BCI research for the generation of suitable control signals to drive an assistive device. Due to the high dimensionality of feature vectors in practical BCI systems, implantation of efficient feature selection algorithms has been an integral area of research in the past decade. This article proposes an efficient feature selection technique, realized by means of an evolutionary algorithm, which attempts to overcome some of the shortcomings of several state-of-the-art approaches in this field. The outlined scheme produces a subset of salient features which improves the classification accuracy while maintaining a trade-off with the computational speed of the complete scheme. For this purpose, an efficient memetic algorithm has also been proposed for the optimization purpose. Extensive experimental validations have been conducted on two real-world datasets to establish the efficacy of our approach. We have compared our approach to existing algorithms and have established the superiority of our algorithm to the rest. "
24156669,"In this study, we propose a recognition system for single-trial analysis of motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Applying event-related brain potential (ERP) data acquired from the sensorimotor cortices, the system chiefly consists of automatic artifact elimination, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. In addition to the use of independent component analysis, a similarity measure is proposed to further remove the electrooculographic (EOG) artifacts automatically. Several potential features, such as wavelet-fractal features, are then extracted for subsequent classification. Next, quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is used to select features from the feature combination. Finally, selected sub-features are classified by support vector machine (SVM). Compared with without artifact elimination, feature selection using a genetic algorithm (GA) and feature classification with Fisher's linear discriminant (FLD) on MI data from two data sets for eight subjects, the results indicate that the proposed method is promising in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications.

24152422,"The tradeoff between computational complexity and speed, in addition to growing demands for real-time BMI (brain-machine interface) systems, expose the necessity of applying methods with least possible complexity. Willison amplitude (WAMP) and slope sign change (SSC) are two promising time-domain features only if the right threshold value is defined for them. To overcome the drawback of going through trial and error for the determination of a suitable threshold value, modified WAMP and modified SSC are proposed in this paper. Besides, a comprehensive assessment of statistical time-domain features in which their effectiveness is evaluated with a support vector machine (SVM) is presented. To ensure the accuracy of the results obtained by the SVM, the performance of each feature is reassessed with supervised fuzzy C-means. The general assessment shows that every subject had at least one of his performances near or greater than 80%. The obtained results prove that for BMI applications, in which a few errors can be tolerated, these combinations of feature-classifier are suitable. Moreover, features that could perform satisfactorily were selected for feature combination. Combinations of the selected features are evaluated with the SVM, and they could significantly improve the results, in some cases, up to full accuracy. "

Solving this challenge would not only enable the refinement of cognitive theory, but also provide a better understanding of cognitive function in the type of complex and unpredictable situations that constitute daily life, and which are often disturbed in clinical populations. With mobile EEG, researchers now have access to a tool that can help address these issues. In this paper we present an overview of technical advancements in mobile EEG systems and associated analysis tools, and explore the benefits of this new technology.

24119870,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are no longer only used by healthy participants under controlled conditions in laboratory environments, but also by patients and end-users, controlling applications in their homes or clinics, without the BCI experts around. But are the technology and the field mature enough for this? Especially the successful operation of applications - like text entry systems or assistive mobility devices such as tele-presence robots - requires a good level of BCI control. How much training is needed to achieve such a level? Is it possible to train naïve end-users in 10 days to successfully control such applications? In this work, we report our experiences of training 24 motor-disabled participants at rehabilitation clinics or at the end-users' homes, without BCI experts present. We also share the lessons that we have learned through transferring BCI technologies from the lab to the user's home or clinics. The most important outcome is that 50% of the participants achieved good BCI performance and could successfully control the applications (tele-presence robot and text-entry system). In the case of the tele-presence robot the participants achieved an average performance ratio of 0.87 (max. 0.97) and for the text entry application a mean of 0.93 (max. 1.0). The lessons learned and the gathered user feedback range from pure BCI problems (technical and handling), to common communication issues among the different people involved, and issues encountered while controlling the applications. The points raised in this paper are very widely applicable and we anticipate that they might be faced similarly by other groups, if they move on to bringing the BCI technology to the end-user, to home environments and towards application prototype control."
24119261,"Motor imagery can elicit brain oscillations in Rolandic mu rhythm and central beta rhythm, both originating in the sensorimotor cortex. In contrast with simple limb motor imagery, less work was reported about compound limb motor imagery which involves several parts of limbs. The goal of this study was to investigate the differences of the EEG patterns between simple limb motor imagery and compound limb motor imagery, and discuss the separability of multiple types of mental tasks. Ten subjects participated in the experiment involving three tasks of simple limb motor imagery (left hand, right hand, feet), three tasks of compound limb motor imagery (both hands, left hand combined with right foot, right hand combined with left foot) and rest state. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP), power spectral entropy (PSE) and spatial distribution coefficient were adopted to analyze these seven EEG patterns. Then three algorithms of modified multi-class common spatial patterns (CSP) were used for feature extraction and classification was implemented by support vector machine (SVM). The induced event-related desynchronization (ERD) affects more components within both alpha and beta bands resulting in more broad ERD bands at electrode positions C3, Cz and C4 during left/right hand combined with contralateral foot imagery, whose PSE values are significant higher than that of simple limb motor imagery. From the topographical distribution, simultaneous imagination of upper limb and contralateral lower limb certainly contributes to the activation of more areas on cerebral cortex. Classification result shows that multi-class stationary Tikhonov regularized CSP (Multi-sTRCSP) outperforms other two multi-class CSP methods, with the highest accuracy of 84% and mean accuracy of 70%. The work implies that there exist the separable differences between simple limb motor imagery and compound limb motor imagery, which can be utilized to build a multimodal classification paradigm in motor imagery based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems."
24111460,"In order to solve uncertainty of spatial weights learned with small amount of training samples for feature extraction from brain signals, a regularization using similarity of signals observed in sensors that are located near each other is proposed. Deriving the regularization is begun defining a distance between the sensors. Under the distance, the proposed regularization works so that the spatial weights extracts similar signals in the nearby sensors. The proposed regularization is applied to the well known common spatial pattern (CSP) method that finds spatial weights for EEG based brain machine interface. In the classification experiment using a dataset of EEG signals during motor imagery, the proposed method achieved maximum improvement by 28% in the classification accuracy over the standard CSP in a setting of even when only five samples are used.

We select a set of features representing the best as possible the studied process. For such purpose, a variability study is performed based on traditional Principal Component Analysis. EEG signals modelling is carried out by feature estimation of three frequency-based and one time-based. Our approach provides testing over a well-known MI dataset. Attained results show that presented algorithm can be used as tool to support discrimination of MI brain activity, obtaining acceptable results in comparison to state of the art approaches. "
24111370,"An electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain computer interface (BCI) is a novel tool that translates brain intentions into control signals. As the operational dimensions of motor imagery are limited, we describe in this paper an extension of its capability by including speech imagery. Our new system was tested with the help of subjects, whose native language is Chinese. The tests were divided into two steps. The first step was speech imagery; consequently motor imagery and speech imagery were merged in the second step. Feature vectors of EEG signals were extracted from both common spatial patterns (CSP) and cross-correlation functions; then these vectors were classified by a support vector machine (SVM). The distinguishing accuracies of two intentions were found to be between 79.33% and 88.26%. This result shows that the capability of BCI for motor imagery can be extended by combining motor imagery and speech imagery. "

The experimental results on two BCI competition datasets show that the classification accuracy is about 90%. The results of the classification accuracy and mutual information demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. "
24111256,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) data from performing motor imagery are usually used to calibrate a subject-specific model in Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interface (MI-BCI). However, the performance of MI is not directly observable by another person. Studies that attempted to address this issue in order to improve subjects with low MI performance had shown that it is feasible to use calibration data from Passive Movement (PM) to detect MI in healthy subjects. This study investigates the feasibility of using calibration data from PM of stroke patients to detect MI. EEG data from 2 calibration runs of MI and PM by a robotic haptic knob, and 1 evaluation run of MI were collected in one session of recording from 34 hemiparetic stroke patients recruited in the clinical study. In each run, 40 trials of MI or PM and 40 trials of the background rest were collected. The off-line run-to-run transfer kappa values from the calibration runs of MI, PM, and combined MI and PM, to the evaluation run of MI were then evaluated and compared. The results showed that calibration using PM (0.392) yielded significantly lower kappa value than the calibration using MI (0.457, p=4.40e-14). The results may be due to a significant disparity between the EEG data from PM and MI in stroke subjects. Nevertheless, the results showed that the calibration using both MI and PM (0.506) yielded significantly higher kappa value than the calibration using MI (0.457, p=9.54e-14). Hence, the results of this study suggest a promising direction to combine calibration data from PM and MI to improve MI detection on stroke. "
24111192,"Passive movement, action observation and motor imagery as well as motor execution have been suggested to facilitate the motor function of human brain. The purpose of this study is to investigate the cortical activation patterns of these four modes using a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system. Seven healthy volunteers underwent optical brain imaging by fNIRS. Passive movements were provided by a functional electrical stimulation (FES). Results demonstrated that while all movement modes commonly activated premotor cortex, there were considerable differences between modes. The pattern of neural activation in motor execution was best resembled by passive movement, followed by motor imagery, and lastly by action observation. This result indicates that action observation may be the least preferred way to activate the sensorimotor cortices. Thus, in order to show the feasibility of motor facilitation by a brain computer interface (BCI) for an extreme case, we paradoxically adopted the observation as a control input of the BCI. An observation-FES integrated BCI activated sensorimotor system stronger than observation but slightly weaker than FES. This limitation should be overcome to utilize the observation-FES integrated BCI as an active motor training method. "
24111009,"This paper presents a novel method, based on multi-channel Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), of classifying the electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of imagined movement by a subject within a brain-computer interfacing (BCI) framework. EMD is a technique that divides any non-linear or non-stationary signal into groups of frequency harmonics, called Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). As frequency is a key component of both IMFs and the μ rhythm (8-13 Hz brain activity generated during motor imagery), IMFs are then grouped by frequency. EMD is applied to the recordings from two electrodes for each trial and the resulting IMFs are grouped according to peak-frequency band via Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA). The cluster containing the frequency band of the μ rhythm (8-13 Hz) is then selected and the sum-total of the IMFs from each electrode are summed together. A simple linear classifier is then sufficient to classify the motor-imagery with 89% sensitivity from a separate test set."
24110873,Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) is a state-of-the-art method for feature extraction in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems. However it is designed for 2-class BCI classification problems. Current extensions of this method to multiple classes based on subspace union and covariance matrix similarity do not provide a high performance. This paper presents a new approach to solving multi-class BCI classification problems by forming a subspace resembled from original subspaces and the proposed method for this approach is called Approximation-based Common Principal Component (ACPC). We perform experiments on Dataset 2a used in BCI Competition IV to evaluate the proposed method. This dataset was designed for motor imagery classification with 4 classes. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed ACPC feature extraction method when combining with Support Vector Machines outperforms CSP-based feature extraction methods on the experimental dataset. 
24110684,"Motor imagery base brain-computer interface (BCI) is an appropriate solution for stroke patient to rehabilitate and communicate with external world. For such applications speculating whether the subjects are doing motor imagery is our primary mission. So the problem turns into how to precisely classify the two tasks, motor imagery and idle state, by using the subjects' electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. Feature extraction is a factor that significantly affects the classification result. Based on the concept of Continuous Wavelet Transform, we proposed a wavelet-liked feature extraction method for motor imagery discrimination. And to compensate the problem that the feature varies between subjects, we use the subjects' own EEG signals as the mother wavelet. After determining the feature vector, we choose Bayes linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as our classifier. The BCI competition III dataset IVa is used to evaluate the classification performance. Comparing with variance and fast Fourier transform (FFT) methods in feature extraction, 2.02% and 16.96% improvement in classification accuracy are obtained in this work respectively. "

With four subjects participating in the study, the experimental results demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed asynchronous 2D control strategy. "
24110311,"Traditional brain-state classifications are primarily based on two well-known neural biomarkers: P300 and motor imagery / event-related frequency modulation. Currently, many brain-computer interface (BCI) systems have successfully helped patients with severe neuromuscular disabilities to regain independence. In order to translate this neural engineering success to hearing aid applications, we must be able to capture brain waves across the population reliably in cortical regions that have not previously been incorporated in these systems before, for example, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and right temporoparietal junction. Here, we present a brain-state classification framework that incorporates individual anatomical information and accounts for potential anatomical and functional differences across subjects by applying appropriate cortical weighting functions prior to the classification stage. Using an inverse imaging approach, use simulated EEG data to show that our method can outperform the traditional brain-state classification approach that trains only on individual subject's data without considering data available at a population level.

24110305,"Recent works on brain functional analysis have highlighted the importance of distributed functional networks and synchronized activity between networks in mediating cognitive functions. The network perspective is fundamental to relate mechanisms of brain functions and the basis for classifying brain states. This work analyzes the network mechanisms related to motor imagery tasks based on synchronization measure (PLV (phase-locking value)) in EEG alpha-band for the BCI Competition IV Data Set. Based on network dissimilarities between motor imagery and rest tasks, important nodes and important channel pairs corresponding to tasks for all subjects are identified. The identified important channel pairs corresponding to tasks demonstrate significant PLV variation in line with the experiment protocol. With the selection of subject-specific reactive band, these channel pairs provide even more higher variation corresponding to tasks. This paper demonstrates the potential of these identified channel pairs in task classification for future BCI applications. "
24110302,"Sensory stimulation played a critical role in both motivating subject's anticipation in brain-computer interface but also enhancing the sensory-motor interaction and closing the sensory motor loop. In this paper, mechanical vibrotactile stimulation effect in motor imagery was evaluated on 10 healthy subjects, and preliminary results showed that 5 subjects would achieve a reliable control above 80% with sensory stimulation as comparable with motor imagery without any stimulation. Besides, 3 subjects reached a better control with approximately 70% as compared with a chance level of 50% in motor imagery without sensory stimulation. Further analysis showed subject who was poor in conventional motor imagery condition exhibited enhanced R(2) value distribution in motor imagery with sensory stimulation condition. Meanwhile there was sensorimotor rhythmic enhancement both at upper alpha band and upper beta band in some subjects. But these rhythmic changes resulted performance reduction as incongruence of training and testing sets effect from off-line analysis. This research provided some guidance in integration of the sensory stimulation channel with motor imagery based BCI system. "
24110173,"Steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (SSSEP) is a recently developing brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm where the brain response to tactile stimulation of a specific frequency is used. Thus far, spatial information was not examined in depth in SSSEP BCI, because frequency information was regarded as the main concern of SSSEP analysis. However, given that the somatosensory cortex areas, each of which correspond to a different body part, are well clustered, we can assume that the spatial information could be beneficial for SSSEP analysis. Based on this assumption, we apply the common spatial pattern (CSP) method, which is the spatial feature extraction method most widely used for the motor imagery BCI paradigm, to SSSEP BCI. Experimental results show that our approach, where two CSP methods are applied to the signal of each frequency band, has a performance improvement from 70% to 75%. "

We apply the proposed modeling program in two different modules of our online BCI-FES rehabilitation platform and achieve a relatively higher discrimination accuracy. Sufficient observations and test cases on patients' MI data sets have been implemented for validating the GMM model.

24110156,"Non-stationarity of electroencephalograph (EEG) data from session-to-session transfer is one of the challenges for EEG-based brain-computer interface systems, which can inversely affect their performance. Among methods proposed to address non-stationarity, adaptation is a promising method. In this study, an adaptive extreme learning machine (AELM) is proposed to update the initial classifier from the calibration session by using chunks of EEG data from the evaluation session whereby the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is used to extract the most discriminative features. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is on motor imagery data collected from 12 healthy subjects during a calibration session and an evaluation session on a separate day. The results from the proposed AELM were compared with non-adaptive ELM and SVM classifiers. The results showed that AELM was significantly better (p=0.03). Moreover, the results also showed that accumulating the evaluation session data and using them for adapting the classifier will significantly improve the performance (p=0.001). Hence, the proposed AELM is effective in addressing the non-stationarity of EEG signal for online BCI systems."

With this BCI mail client, users can receive, read, write mails, as well as attach files in mail writing. The system has been tested on 3 subjects. Experimental results show that mail communication with this system is feasible. "
24110149,"Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is rapidly gaining interest in both the Neuroscience, as well as the Brain-Computer-Interface (BCI) community. Despite these efforts, most single-trial analysis of fNIRS data is focused on motor-imagery, or mental arithmetics. In this study, we investigate the suitability of different mental tasks, namely mental arithmetics, word generation and mental rotation for fNIRS based BCIs. We provide the first systematic comparison of classification accuracies achieved in a sample study. Data was collected from 10 subjects performing these three tasks. "
24109715,"The performance degradation for session to session classification in brain computer interface is a critical problem. This paper proposes a novel method for model adaptation based on motor imagery of swallow EEG signal for dysphagia rehabilitation. A small amount of calibration testing data is utilized to select the model catering for test data. The features of the training and calibration testing data are firstly clustered and each cluster is labeled by the dominant label of the training data. The cluster with the minimum impurity is selected and the number of features consistent with the cluster label are calculated for both training and calibration testing data. Finally, the training model with the maximum number of consistent features is selected. Experiments conducted on motor imagery of swallow EEG data achieved an average accuracy of 74.29% and 72.64% with model adaptation for Laplacian derivates of power features and wavelet features, respectively. Further, an average accuracy increase of 2.9% is achieved with model adaptation using wavelet features, in comparison with that achieved without model adaptation, which is significant at 5% significance level as demonstrated in the statistical test.

24109679,"Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) using event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the electroencephalogram (EEG), which is believed to represent increased activation of the sensorimotor cortex, have attracted attention as tools for rehabilitation of upper limb motor functions in hemiplegic stroke patients. However, it remains unclear whether the corticospinal excitability is actually correlated with ERD. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between the ERD magnitude and the excitability of primary motor cortex (M1) and spinal motoneurons. M1 excitability was tested by motor evoked potentials (MEPs), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) using transcranial magnetic stimulation, and spinal motoneuronal excitability was tested by F-waves using peripheral nerve stimulation. Results showed that large ERD during motor imagery was associated with significantly increased F-wave persistence and reduced SICI, but no significant changes in ICF and the response average of F-wave amplitudes. Our findings suggest that ERD magnitude during motor imagery represents the instantaneous excitability of both M1 and spinal motoneurons. This study provides electrophysiological evidence that ERD-based BCI with motor imagery task increases corticospinal excitability as changes accompanying actual movements. "
24109675,"Resent studies suggest that brain-computer interface (BCI) training for chronic stroke patient is useful to improve their motor function of paretic hand. However, these studies does not show the extent of the contribution of the BCI clearly because they prescribed BCI with other rehabilitation systems, e.g. an orthosis itself, a robotic intervention, or electrical stimulation. We therefore compared neurological effects between interventions with neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) with motor imagery and BCI-driven NMES, employing an ABAB experimental design. In epoch A, the subject received NMES on paretic extensor digitorum communis (EDC). The subject was asked to attempt finger extension simultaneously. In epoch B, the subject received NMES when BCI system detected motor-related electroencephalogram change while attempting motor imagery. Both epochs were carried out for 60 min per day, 5 days per week. As a result, EMG activity of EDC was enhanced by BCI-driven NMES and significant cortico-muscular coherence was observed at the final evaluation. These results indicate that the training by BCI-driven NMES is effective even compared to motor imagery combined with NMES, suggesting the superiority of closed-loop training with BCI-driven NMES to open-loop NMES for chronic stroke patients. "
24109674,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has the potential as a post-stroke rehabilitation tool, and the efficacy of the technology is most often demonstrated through output peripherals such as robots, orthosis and computers. In this study, the EEG signals recorded during the course of upper limb stroke rehabilitaion using motor imagery BCI were analyzed to better understand the effect of BCI therapy for post-stroke rehabilitation. The stroke patients recruited underwent 10 sessions of 1-hour BCI with robotic feedback for 2 weeks, 5 times a week. The analysis was performed by computing the coherences of the EEG in the lesion and contralesion side of the hemisphere from each session, and the coherence index of the lesion hemisphere (0 ≤ CI ≤ 1) was computed. The coherence index represents the rate of activation of the lesion hemisphere, and the correlation with the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) before and after the BCI therapy was investigated. Significant improvement in the FMA scores was reported for five of the six patients (p = 0.01). The analysis showed that the number of sessions with CI ≥ 0.5 correlated with the change in the FMA scores. This suggests that post-stroke motor recovery best results from the activation in the lesion hemisphere, which is in agreement with previous studies performed using multimodal imaging technologies.

24086710,"This study implemented a systematic user-centered training protocol for a 4-class brain-computer interface (BCI). The goal was to optimize the BCI individually in order to achieve high performance within few sessions for all users. Eight able-bodied volunteers, who were initially naïve to the use of a BCI, participated in 10 sessions over a period of about 5 weeks. In an initial screening session, users were asked to perform the following seven mental tasks while multi-channel EEG was recorded: mental rotation, word association, auditory imagery, mental subtraction, spatial navigation, motor imagery of the left hand and motor imagery of both feet. Out of these seven mental tasks, the best 4-class combination as well as most reactive frequency band (between 8-30 Hz) was selected individually for online control. Classification was based on common spatial patterns and Fisher's linear discriminant analysis. The number and time of classifier updates varied individually. Selection speed was increased by reducing trial length. To minimize differences in brain activity between sessions with and without feedback, sham feedback was provided in the screening and calibration runs in which usually no real-time feedback is shown. Selected task combinations and frequency ranges differed between users. The tasks that were included in the 4-class combination most often were (1) motor imagery of the left hand (2), one brain-teaser task (word association or mental subtraction) (3), mental rotation task and (4) one more dynamic imagery task (auditory imagery, spatial navigation, imagery of the feet). Participants achieved mean performances over sessions of 44-84% and peak performances in single-sessions of 58-93% in this user-centered 4-class BCI protocol. This protocol is highly adjustable to individual users and thus could increase the percentage of users who can gain and maintain BCI control. A high priority for future work is to examine this protocol with severely disabled users. "
24079396,"We investigated the efficacy of motor imagery-based Brain Computer Interface (MI-based BCI) training for eight stroke patients with severe upper extremity paralysis using longitudinal clinical assessments. The results were compared with those of a control group (n = 7) that only received FES (Functional Electrical Stimulation) treatment besides conventional therapies. During rehabilitation training, changes in the motor function of the upper extremity and in the neurophysiologic electroencephalographic (EEG) were observed for two groups. After 8 weeks of training, a significant improvement in the motor function of the upper extremity for the BCI group was confirmed (p < 0.05 for ARAT), simultaneously with the activation of bilateral cerebral hemispheres. Additionally, event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the affected sensorimotor cortexes (SMCs) was significantly enhanced when compared to the pretraining course, which was only observed in the BCI group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the activation of affected SMC and parietal lobe were determined to contribute to motor function recovery (p < 0.05). In brief, our findings demonstrate that MI-based BCI training can enhance the motor function of the upper extremity for stroke patients by inducing the optimal cerebral motor functional reorganization.

24068244,"Electroencephalography has become a popular tool in basic brain research, but in recent years, several practical limitations have been highlighted. Some of the drawbacks pertain to the offline analyses of the neural signal that prevent the subjects from engaging in real-time error correction during learning. Other limitations include the complex nature of the visual stimuli, often inducing fatigue and introducing considerable delays, possibly interfering with spontaneous performance. By replacing the complex external visual input with internally driven motor imagery, we can overcome some delay problems, at the expense of losing the ability to precisely parameterize features of the input stimulus. To address these issues, we here introduce a nontrivial modification to brain-computer Interfaces (BCI). We combine the fast signal processing of motor imagery with the ability to parameterize external visual feedback in the context of a very simple control task: attempting to intentionally control the direction of an external cursor on command. By engaging the subject in motor imagery while providing real-time visual feedback on their instantaneous performance, we can take advantage of positive features present in both externally- and internally driven learning. We further use a classifier that automatically selects the cortical activation features that most likely maximize the performance accuracy. Under this closed loop coadaptation system, we saw a progression of the cortical activation that started in sensorymotor areas, when at chance performance motor imagery was explicitly used, migrated to BA6 under deliberate control and ended in the more frontal regions of prefrontal cortex, when at maximal performance accuracy, the subjects reportedly developed spontaneous mental control of the instructed direction. We discuss our results in light of possible applications of this simple BCI paradigm to study various cognitive phenomena involving the deliberate control of a directional signal in decision making tasks performed with intent.

24064256,"The bilateral loss of the grasp function associated with a lesion of the cervical spinal cord severely limits the affected individuals' ability to live independently and return to gainful employment after sustaining a spinal cord injury (SCI). Any improvement in lost or limited grasp function is highly desirable. With current neuroprostheses, relevant improvements can be achieved in end users with preserved shoulder and elbow, but missing hand function. The aim of this single case study is to show that (1) with the support of hybrid neuroprostheses combining functional electrical stimulation (FES) with orthoses, restoration of hand, finger and elbow function is possible in users with high-level SCI and (2) shared control principles can be effectively used to allow for a brain-computer interface (BCI) control, even if only moderate BCI performance is achieved after extensive training. The individual in this study is a right-handed 41-year-old man who sustained a traumatic SCI in 2009 and has a complete motor and sensory lesion at the level of C4. He is unable to generate functionally relevant movements of the elbow, hand and fingers on either side. He underwent extensive FES training (30-45min, 2-3 times per week for 6 months) and motor imagery (MI) BCI training (415 runs in 43 sessions over 12 months). To meet individual needs, the system was designed in a modular fashion including an intelligent control approach encompassing two input modalities, namely an MI-BCI and shoulder movements. After one year of training, the end user's MI-BCI performance ranged from 50% to 93% (average: 70.5%). The performance of the hybrid system was evaluated with different functional assessments. The user was able to transfer objects of the grasp-and-release-test and he succeeded in eating a pretzel stick, signing a document and eating an ice cream cone, which he was unable to do without the system. This proof-of-concept study has demonstrated that with the support of hybrid FES systems consisting of FES and a semiactive orthosis, restoring hand, finger and elbow function is possible in a tetraplegic end-user. Remarkably, even after one year of training and 415 MI-BCI runs, the end user's average BCI performance remained at about 70%. This supports the view that in high-level tetraplegic subjects, an initially moderate BCI performance cannot be improved by extensive training. However, this aspect has to be validated in future studies with a larger population."
24048242,"In this study, an electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis system combined with feature selection, is proposed to enhance the classification of motor imagery (MI) data. It principally comprises feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. First, several features, including adaptive autoregressive (AAR) parameters, spectral power, asymmetry ratio, coherence and phase-locking value are extracted for subsequent classification. A genetic algorithm is then used to select features from the combination of the aforementioned features. Finally, the selected features are classified by support vector machine (SVM). Compared with ""without feature selection"" and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) on MI data from 2 data sets, the proposed system achieves better classification accuracy and is suitable for the applications of brain-computer interface (BCI)."
23973334,"This paper presents a study on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) indicating that the hemodynamic responses of the right- and left-wrist motor imageries have distinct patterns that can be classified using a linear classifier for the purpose of developing a brain-computer interface (BCI). Ten healthy participants were instructed to imagine kinesthetically the right- or left-wrist flexion indicated on a computer screen. Signals from the right and left primary motor cortices were acquired simultaneously using a multi-channel continuous-wave fNIRS system. Using two distinct features (the mean and the slope of change in the oxygenated hemoglobin concentration), the linear discriminant analysis classifier was used to classify the right- and left-wrist motor imageries resulting in average classification accuracies of 73.35% and 83.0%, respectively, during the 10s task period. Moreover, when the analysis time was confined to the 2-7s span within the overall 10s task period, the average classification accuracies were improved to 77.56% and 87.28%, respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of an fNIRS-based BCI and the enhanced performance of the classifier by removing the initial 2s span and/or the time span after the peak value. "
23919646,"Brain computer interfaces (BCI) is one of the most popular branches in biomedical engineering. It aims at constructing a communication between the disabled persons and the auxiliary equipments in order to improve the patients' life. In motor imagery (MI) based BCI, one of the popular feature extraction strategies is Common Spatial Patterns (CSP). In practical BCI situation, scalp EEG inevitably has the outlier and artifacts introduced by ocular, head motion or the loose contact of electrodes in scalp EEG recordings. Because outlier and artifacts are usually observed with large amplitude, when CSP is solved in view of L2 norm, the effect of outlier and artifacts will be exaggerated due to the imposing of square to outliers, which will finally influence the MI based BCI performance. While L1 norm will lower the outlier effects as proved in other application fields like EEG inverse problem, face recognition, etc. In this paper, we present a new CSP implementation using the L1 norm technique, instead of the L2 norm, to solve the eigen problem for spatial filter estimation with aim to improve the robustness of CSP to outliers. To evaluate the performance of our method, we applied our method as well as the standard CSP and the regularized CSP with Tikhonov regularization (TR-CSP), on both the peer BCI dataset with simulated outliers and the dataset from the MI BCI system developed in our group. The McNemar test is used to investigate whether the difference among the three CSPs is of statistical significance. The results of both the simulation and real BCI datasets consistently reveal that the proposed method has much higher classification accuracies than the conventional CSP and the TR-CSP. By combining L1 norm based Eigen decomposition into Common Spatial Patterns, the proposed approach can effectively improve the robustness of BCI system to EEG outliers and thus be potential for the actual MI BCI application, where outliers are inevitably introduced into EEG recordings."
23918205,"In this work we present--for the first time--the online operation of an electroencephalogram (EEG) brain-computer interface (BCI) system based on covert visuospatial attention (CVSA), without relying on any evoked responses. Electrophysiological correlates of pure top-down CVSA have only recently been proposed as a control signal for BCI. Such systems are expected to share the ease of use of stimulus-driven BCIs (e.g. P300, steady state visually evoked potential) with the autonomy afforded by decoding voluntary modulations of ongoing activity (e.g. motor imagery). Eight healthy subjects participated in the study. EEG signals were acquired with an active 64-channel system. The classification method was based on a time-dependent approach tuned to capture the most discriminant spectral features of the temporal evolution of attentional processes. The system was used by all subjects over two days without retraining, to verify its robustness and reliability. We report a mean online accuracy across the group of 70.6 ± 1.5%, and 88.8 ± 5.8% for the best subject. Half of the participants produced stable features over the entire duration of the study. Additionally, we explain drops in performance in subjects showing stable features in terms of known electrophysiological correlates of fatigue, suggesting the prospect of online monitoring of mental states in BCI systems. This work represents the first demonstration of the feasibility of an online EEG BCI based on CVSA. The results achieved suggest the CVSA BCI as a promising alternative to standard BCI modalities."
23908614,"Cue-paced motor imagery (MI) is a frequently used mental strategy to realize a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). Recently it has been reported that two MI tasks can be separated with a high accuracy within the first second after cue presentation onset. To investigate this phenomenon in detail we studied the dynamics of motor cortex beta oscillations in EEG and the changes in heart rate (HR) during visual cue-paced foot MI using a go (execution of imagery) vs. nogo (withholding of imagery) paradigm in 16 healthy subjects. Both execution and withholding of MI resulted in a brisk centrally localized beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) with a maximum at ~400 ms and a concomitant HR deceleration. We found that response patterns within the first second after stimulation differed between conditions. The ERD was significantly larger in go as compared to nogo. In contrast the HR deceleration was somewhat smaller and followed by an acceleration in go as compared to nogo. These findings suggest that the early beta ERD reflects visually induced preparatory activity in motor cortex networks. Both the early beta ERD and the HR deceleration are the result of automatic operating processes that are likely part of the orienting reflex (OR). Of interest, however, is that the preparatory cortical activity is strengthened and the HR modulated already within the first second after stimulation during the execution of MI. The subtraction of the HR time course of the nogo from the go condition revealed a slight HR acceleration in the first seconds most likely due to the increased mental effort associated with the imagery process.

23901117,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can convert mental states into signals to drive real-world devices, but it is not known if a given covert task is the same when performed with and without BCI-based control. Using a BCI likely involves additional cognitive processes, such as multitasking, attention, and conflict monitoring. In addition, it is challenging to measure the quality of covert task performance. We used whole-brain classifier-based real-time functional MRI to address these issues, because the method provides both classifier-based maps to examine the neural requirements of BCI and classification accuracy to quantify the quality of task performance. Subjects performed a covert counting task at fast and slow rates to control a visual interface. Compared with the same task when viewing but not controlling the interface, we observed that being in control of a BCI improved task classification of fast and slow counting states. Additional BCI control increased subjects' whole-brain signal-to-noise ratio compared with the absence of control. The neural pattern for control consisted of a positive network comprised of dorsal parietal and frontal regions and the anterior insula of the right hemisphere as well as an expansive negative network of regions. These findings suggest that real-time functional MRI can serve as a platform for exploring information processing and frontoparietal and insula network-based regulation of whole-brain task signal-to-noise ratio.

23895046,"Effective learning and recovery of relevant source brain activity patterns is a major challenge to brain-computer interface using scalp EEG. Various spatial filtering solutions have been developed. Most current methods estimate an instantaneous demixing with the assumption of uncorrelatedness of the source signals. However, recent evidence in neuroscience suggests that multiple brain regions cooperate, especially during motor imagery, a major modality of brain activity for brain-computer interface. In this sense, methods that assume uncorrelatedness of the sources become inaccurate. Therefore, we are promoting a new methodology that considers both volume conduction effect and signal propagation between multiple brain regions. Specifically, we propose a novel discriminative algorithm for joint learning of propagation and spatial pattern with an iterative optimization solution. To validate the new methodology, we conduct experiments involving 16 healthy subjects and perform numerical analysis of the proposed algorithm for EEG classification in motor imagery brain-computer interface. Results from extensive analysis validate the effectiveness of the new methodology with high statistical significance. "
23866985,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) can leave the affected individuals with paraparesis or paraplegia, thus rendering them unable to ambulate. Since there are currently no restorative treatments for this population, novel approaches such as brain-controlled prostheses have been sought. Our recent studies show that a brain-computer interface (BCI) can be used to control ambulation within a virtual reality environment (VRE), suggesting that a BCI-controlled lower extremity prosthesis for ambulation may be feasible. However, the operability of our BCI has not yet been tested in a SCI population. Five participants with paraplegia or tetraplegia due to SCI underwent a 10-min training session in which they alternated between kinesthetic motor imagery (KMI) of idling and walking while their electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded. Participants then performed a goal-oriented online task, where they utilized KMI to control the linear ambulation of an avatar while making 10 sequential stops at designated points within the VRE. Multiple online trials were performed in a single day, and this procedure was repeated across 5 experimental days. Classification accuracy of idling and walking was estimated offline and ranged from 60.5% (p = 0.0176) to 92.3% (p = 1.36×10-20) across participants and days. Offline analysis revealed that the activation of mid-frontal areas mostly in the μ and low β bands was the most consistent feature for differentiating between idling and walking KMI. In the online task, participants achieved an average performance of 7.4±2.3 successful stops in 273±51 sec. These performances were purposeful, i.e. significantly different from the random walk Monte Carlo simulations (p<0.01), and all but one participant achieved purposeful control within the first day of the experiments. Finally, all participants were able to maintain purposeful control throughout the study, and their online performances improved over time. The results of this study demonstrate that SCI participants can purposefully operate a self-paced BCI walking simulator to complete a goal-oriented ambulation task. The operation of the proposed BCI system requires short training, is intuitive, and robust against participant-to-participant and day-to-day neurophysiological variations. These findings indicate that BCI-controlled lower extremity prostheses for gait rehabilitation or restoration after SCI may be feasible in the future."
23866606,The mechanisms underlying the process of motor imagery are similar to the motor control mechanisms. It can be used for motor learning in patients with movement disorders. Motor imagery may be the only one method for recovery of motor function in patients with severe paresis. It was the prerequisite of increased scientist interest in motor imagery during last decade. Brain-computer interface technology can support the motor imagery trainings.
23858742,"This paper introduces the characteristics of the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), and studies the classification of movement imagery EEG based on the HHT method and BP neural network. After preprocessed, the movement imagery EEG data were descomposed with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then the low frequency IMFs were removed, and the rest of IMFs were conducted by Hilbert transform to get Hilbert marginal spectrum. The marginal spectrum subtracted values between the channal C3 and channal C4 were selected as the original features which were then decreased the dimension by the principal components analysis so as to be jointed with EEG complexity to construct the feature vector. The BP neural network was utilized to classify the EEG pattern of left and right hand motor imagery. The brain computer interface (BCI) competition II data set III was selected to carry out the discrimination, and the classification accuracy rate is up to 87.14%, which is a comparably good result and proves HHT to be a feasible and effective method on EEG analysis."
23843600,"Multiresolution analysis (MRA) offers a useful framework for signal analysis in the temporal and spectral domains, although commonly employed MRA methods may not be the best approach for brain computer interface (BCI) applications. This study aims to develop a new MRA system for extracting tempo-spatial-spectral features for BCI applications based on wavelet lifting over graphs. This paper proposes a new graph-based transform for wavelet lifting and a tailored simple graph representation for electroencephalography (EEG) data, which results in an MRA system where temporal, spectral and spatial characteristics are used to extract motor imagery features from EEG data. The transformed data is processed within a simple experimental framework to test the classification performance of the new method. The proposed method can significantly improve the classification results obtained by various wavelet families using the same methodology. Preliminary results using common spatial patterns as feature extraction method show that we can achieve comparable classification accuracy to more sophisticated methodologies. From the analysis of the results we can obtain insights into the pattern development in the EEG data, which provide useful information for feature basis selection and thus for improving classification performance. Applying wavelet lifting over graphs is a new approach for handling BCI data. The inherent flexibility of the lifting scheme could lead to new approaches based on the hereby proposed method for further classification performance improvement."
23789390,The paper examines neurophysiological basis for development and performance of brain-computer interface (BCI) that permits cerebral activity alone to control computers or other external technical devices. BCI based on the discrimination of EEG patterns related to an imagery of extremity movements is considered.

23781166,"Neuroimaging studies provide evidence of cortical involvement immediately before and during gait and during gait-related behaviors such as stepping in place or motor imagery of gait. Here we attempt to perform single-trial classification of gait intent from another movement plan (point intent) or from standing in place. Subjects walked naturally from a starting position to a designated ending position, pointed at a designated position from the starting position, or remained standing at the starting position. The 700 ms of recorded electroencephalography (EEG) before movement onset was used for single-trial classification of trials based on action type and direction (left walk, forward walk, right walk, left point, right point, and stand) as well as action type regardless of direction (stand, walk, point). Classification using regularized LDA was performed on a principal components analysis (PCA) reduced feature space composed of coefficients from levels 1 to 9 of a discrete wavelet decomposition using the Daubechies 4 wavelet. We achieved significant classification for all conditions, with errors as low as 17% when averaged across nine subjects. LDA and PCA highly weighted frequency ranges that included movement related potentials (MRPs), with smaller contributions from frequency ranges that included mu and beta idle motor rhythms. Additionally, error patterns suggested a spatial structure to the EEG signal. Future applications of the cortical gait intent signal may include an additional dimension of control for prosthetics, preemptive corrective feedback for gait disturbances, or human computer interfaces (HCI)."
23762253,"In this work, mechanical vibrotactile stimulation was applied to subjects' left and right wrist skins with equal intensity, and a selective sensation perception task was performed to achieve two types of selections similar to motor imagery Brain-Computer Interface. The proposed system was based on event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS), which had a correlation with processing of afferent inflow in human somatosensory system, and attentional effect which modulated the ERD/ERS. The experiments were carried out on nine subjects (without experience in selective sensation), and six of them showed a discrimination accuracy above 80%, three of them above 95%. Comparative experiments with motor imagery (with and without presence of stimulation) were also carried out, which further showed the feasibility of selective sensation as an alternative BCI task complementary to motor imagery. Specifically there was significant improvement ([Formula: see text]) from near 65% in motor imagery (with and without presence of stimulation) to above 80% in selective sensation on some subjects. The proposed BCI modality might well cooperate with existing BCI modalities in the literature in enlarging the widespread usage of BCI system."
23761697,"There is increasing interest in electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) as a tool for rehabilitation of upper limb motor functions in hemiplegic stroke patients. This type of BCI often exploits mu and beta oscillations in EEG recorded over the sensorimotor areas, and their event-related desynchronization (ERD) following motor imagery is believed to represent increased sensorimotor cortex excitability. However, it remains unclear whether the sensorimotor cortex excitability is actually correlated with ERD. Thus we assessed the association of ERD with primary motor cortex (M1) excitability during motor imagery of right wrist movement. M1 excitability was tested by motor evoked potentials (MEPs), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF) with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Twenty healthy participants were recruited. The participants performed 7 s of rest followed by 5 s of motor imagery and received online visual feedback of the ERD magnitude of the contralateral hand M1 while performing the motor imagery task. TMS was applied to the right hand M1 when ERD exceeded predetermined thresholds during motor imagery. MEP amplitudes, SICI, and ICF were recorded from the agonist muscle of the imagined hand movement. Results showed that the large ERD during wrist motor imagery was associated with significantly increased MEP amplitudes and reduced SICI but no significant changes in ICF. Thus ERD magnitude during wrist motor imagery represents M1 excitability. This study provides electrophysiological evidence that a motor imagery task involving ERD may induce changes in corticospinal excitability similar to changes accompanying actual movements. "
23757379,"The purpose of this study was to investigate cortical lateralization of event-related (de)synchronization during left and right foot motor imagery tasks and to determine classification accuracy of the two imaginary movements in a brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm. We recorded 31-channel scalp electroencephalograms (EEGs) from nine healthy subjects during brisk imagery tasks of left and right foot movements. EEG was analyzed with time-frequency maps and topographies, and the accuracy rate of classification between left and right foot movements was calculated. Beta rebound at the end of imagination (increase of EEG beta rhythm amplitude) was identified from the two EEGs derived from the right-shift and left-shift bipolar pairs at the vertex. This process enabled discrimination between right or left foot imagery at a high accuracy rate (maximum 81.6% in single trial analysis). These data suggest that foot motor imagery has potential to elicit left-right differences in EEG, while BCI using the unilateral foot imagery can achieve high classification accuracy, similar to ordinary BCI, based on hand motor imagery. By combining conventional discrimination techniques, the left-right discrimination of unilateral foot motor imagery provides a novel BCI system that could control a foot neuroprosthesis or a robotic foot."
23751454,"Many brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) use band power (BP) changes in the electroencephalogram to distinguish between different motor imagery (MI) patterns. Most current approaches do not take connectivity of separated brain areas into account. Our objective is to introduce single-trial connectivity features and apply these features to BCI data. We introduce a procedure for extracting single-trial connectivity estimates from vector autoregressive (VAR) models of independent components in a BCI setting. In a simulated BCI, we demonstrate that the directed transfer function (DTF) with full-frequency normalization and the direct DTF give classification results similar to BP, while other measures such as the partial directed coherence perform significantly worse. We show that single-trial MI classification is possible with connectivity measures extracted from VAR models, and that a BCI could potentially utilize such measures."
23746288,"Discriminative features have to be properly extracted and selected from the electroencephalographic (EEG) signals of each specific subject in order to achieve an adaptive brain-computer interface (BCI) system. This work presents an efficient wrapper-based methodology for feature selection and least squares discrimination of high-dimensional EEG data with low computational complexity. Features are computed in different time segments using three widely used methods for motor imagery tasks and, then, they are concatenated or averaged in order to take into account the time course variability of the EEG signals. Once EEG features have been extracted, proposed framework comprises two stages. The first stage entails feature ranking and, in this work, two different procedures have been considered, the least angle regression (LARS) and the Wilcoxon rank sum test, to compare the performance of each one. The second stage selects the most relevant features using an efficient leave-one-out (LOO) estimation based on the Allen's PRESS statistic. Experimental comparisons with the state-of-the-art BCI methods shows that this approach gives better results than current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of recognition rates and computational requirements and, also with respect to the first ranking stage, it is confirmed that the LARS algorithm provides better results than the Wilcoxon rank sum test for these experiments."

In this study, we report a novel experiment of BCI controlling a robotic quadcopter in three-dimensional (3D) physical space using noninvasive scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) in human subjects. We then quantify the performance of this system using metrics suitable for asynchronous BCI. Lastly, we examine the impact that the operation of a real world device has on subjects' control in comparison to a 2D virtual cursor task. Five human subjects were trained to modulate their sensorimotor rhythms to control an AR Drone navigating a 3D physical space. Visual feedback was provided via a forward facing camera on the hull of the drone. Individual subjects were able to accurately acquire up to 90.5% of all valid targets presented while travelling at an average straight-line speed of 0.69 m s(-1). Freely exploring and interacting with the world around us is a crucial element of autonomy that is lost in the context of neurodegenerative disease. Brain-computer interfaces are systems that aim to restore or enhance a user's ability to interact with the environment via a computer and through the use of only thought. We demonstrate for the first time the ability to control a flying robot in 3D physical space using noninvasive scalp recorded EEG in humans. Our work indicates the potential of noninvasive EEG-based BCI systems for accomplish complex control in 3D physical space. The present study may serve as a framework for the investigation of multidimensional noninvasive BCI control in a physical environment using telepresence robotics."
25206446,"Brain-computer interface is a communication system that connects the brain with computer (or other devices) but is not dependent on the normal output of the brain (i.e., peripheral nerve and muscle). Electro-oculogram is a dominant artifact which has a significant negative influence on further analysis of real electroencephalography data. This paper presented a data adaptive technique for artifact suppression and brain wave extraction from electroencephalography signals to detect regional brain activities. Empirical mode decomposition based adaptive thresholding approach was employed here to suppress the electro-oculogram artifact. Fractional Gaussian noise was used to determine the threshold level derived from the analysis data without any training. The purified electroencephalography signal was composed of the brain waves also called rhythmic components which represent the brain activities. The rhythmic components were extracted from each electroencephalography channel using adaptive wiener filter with the original scale. The regional brain activities were mapped on the basis of the spatial distribution of rhythmic components, and the results showed that different regions of the brain are activated in response to different stimuli. This research analyzed the activities of a single rhythmic component, alpha with respect to different motor imaginations. The experimental results showed that the proposed method is very efficient in artifact suppression and identifying individual motor imagery based on the activities of alpha component. "
23714227,"In the present study we implemented a real-time feedback system based on multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Prior studies indicated that NIRS-based neurofeedback can enhance motor imagery related cortical activation. To specify these prior results and to confirm the efficacy of NIRS-based neurofeedback, we examined changes in blood oxygenation level collected in eight training sessions. One group got real feedback about their own brain activity (N=9) and one group saw a playback of another person's feedback recording (N=8). All participants performed motor imagery of a right hand movement. Real neurofeedback induced specific and focused brain activation over left motor areas. This focal brain activation became even more specific over the eight training sessions. In contrast, sham feedback led to diffuse brain activation patterns over the whole cortex. These findings can be useful when training patients with focal brain lesions to increase activity of specific brain areas for rehabilitation purpose. "
23690880,"Brain-computer interface-based communication plays an important role in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications; electronic mail is one of the most common communication tools. In this study, we propose a hybrid BCI-based mail client that implements electronic mail communication by means of real-time classification of multimodal features extracted from scalp electroencephalography (EEG). With this BCI mail client, users can receive, read, write, and attach files to their mail. Using a BCI mouse that utilizes hybrid brain signals, that is, motor imagery and P300 potential, the user can select and activate the function keys and links on the mail client graphical user interface (GUI). An adaptive P300 speller is employed for text input. The system has been tested with 6 subjects, and the experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed method."
23684128,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been proposed as a potential assistive device for individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) to assist with their communication needs. However, it is unclear how well-suited BCIs are to individuals with CP. Therefore, this study aims to investigate to what extent these users are able to gain control of BCIs. This study is conducted with 14 individuals with CP attempting to control two standard online BCIs (1) based upon sensorimotor rhythm modulations, and (2) based upon steady state visual evoked potentials. Of the 14 users, 8 are able to use one or other of the BCIs, online, with a statistically significant level of accuracy, without prior training. Classification results are driven by neurophysiological activity and not seen to correlate with occurrences of artifacts. However, many of these users' accuracies, while statistically significant, would require either more training or more advanced methods before practical BCI control would be possible. The results indicate that BCIs may be controlled by individuals with CP but that many issues need to be overcome before practical application use may be achieved. This is the first study to assess the ability of a large group of different individuals with CP to gain control of an online BCI system. The results indicate that six users could control a sensorimotor rhythm BCI and three a steady state visual evoked potential BCI at statistically significant levels of accuracy (SMR accuracies; mean ± STD, 0.821 ± 0.116, SSVEP accuracies; 0.422 ± 0.069)."
23663147,"A major challenge in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is the intersession nonstationarity in the EEG data that often leads to deteriorated BCI performances. To address this issue, this letter proposes a novel data space adaptation technique, EEG data space adaptation (EEG-DSA), to linearly transform the EEG data from the target space (evaluation session), such that the distribution difference to the source space (training session) is minimized. Using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence criterion, we propose two versions of the EEG-DSA algorithm: the supervised version, when labeled data are available in the evaluation session, and the unsupervised version, when labeled data are not available. The performance of the proposed EEG-DSA algorithm is evaluated on the publicly available BCI Competition IV data set IIa and a data set recorded from 16 subjects performing motor imagery tasks on different days. The results show that the proposed EEG-DSA algorithm in both the supervised and unsupervised versions significantly outperforms the results without adaptation in terms of classification accuracy. The results also show that for subjects with poor BCI performances when no adaptation is applied, the proposed EEG-DSA algorithm in both the supervised and unsupervised versions significantly outperforms the unsupervised bias adaptation algorithm (PMean)."
23651839,"The present study aims to gain insights into the effects of training with a motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) on activation patterns of the sensorimotor cortex. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate long-term training effects across 10 sessions using a 2-class (right hand and feet) MI-based BCI in fifteen subjects. In the course of the training a significant enhancement of activation pattern emerges, represented by an [oxy-Hb] increase in fNIRS and a stronger event-related desynchronization in the upper β-frequency band in the EEG. These effects were only visible in participants with relatively low BCI performance (mean accuracy ≤ 70%). We found that training with an MI-based BCI affects cortical activation patterns especially in users with low BCI performance. Our results may serve as a valuable contribution to the field of BCI research and provide information about the effects that training with an MI-based BCI has on cortical activation patterns. This might be useful for clinical applications of BCI which aim at promoting and guiding neuroplasticity."
23643578,"Few brain-computer interface (BCI) studies have addressed learning mechanisms by exposure to visual feedback that elicits scalp electroencephalogram. We examined the effect of realistic visual feedback of hand movement associated with sensorimotor rhythm. Thirty-two healthy participants performed in five daily training in which they were shown motor imagery of their dominant hand. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 experimental groups receiving different types of visual feedback on event-related desynchronisation (ERD) derived over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex: no feedback as a control, bar feedback with changing bar length, anatomically incongruent feedback in which the hand open/grasp picture on screen was animated at eye level, and anatomically congruent feedback in which the same hand open/grasp picture was animated on the screen overlaying the participant's hand. Daily training with all types of visual feedback induced more robust ERD than the no feedback condition (p < 0.05). The anatomically congruent feedback produced the highest reproducibility of ERD with the smallest inter-trial variance (p < 0.05). Realistic feedback training is a suitable method to acquire the skill to control a BCI system. This finding highlights the possibility of improvement of reproducibility of ERD and can help to use BCI techniques."
23642833,"Regardless of the paradigm used to implement a brain-computer interface (BCI), all systems suffer from BCI-inefficiency. In the case of patients the inefficiency can be high. Some solutions have been proposed to overcome this problem, however they have not been completely successful yet. EEG from 10 healthy users was recorded during neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) of hands and feet and during motor imagery (MI) of the same limbs. Features and classifiers were computed using part of these data to decode MI. Offline analyses showed that it was possible to decode MI using a classifier based on afferent patterns induced by NMES and even infer a better model than with MI data. Afferent NMES motor patterns can support the calibration of BCI systems and be used to decode MI. This finding might be a new way to train sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) based BCI systems for healthy users having difficulties to attain BCI control. It might also be an alternative to train MI-based BCIs for users who cannot perform real movements but have remaining afferents (ALS, stroke patients)."
23639955,"In recent years, numerous brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor-imagery have been proposed which incorporate features such as adaptive classification, error detection and correction, fusion with auxiliary signals and shared control capabilities. Due to the added complexity of such algorithms, the evaluation strategy and metrics used for analysis must be carefully chosen to accurately represent the performance of the BCI. In this article, metrics are reviewed and contrasted using both simulated examples and experimental data. Furthermore, a review of the recent literature is presented to determine how BCIs are evaluated, in particular, focusing on the relationship between how the data are used relative to the BCI subcomponent under investigation. From the analysis performed in this study, valuable guidelines are presented regarding the choice of metrics and evaluation strategy dependent upon any chosen BCI paradigm."
23624244,"An important factor in the usability of a brain-computer interface (BCI) is the setup and calibration time required for the interface to perform accurately. Recently, brain-switches based on the beta rebound following motor imagery of a single limb effector have been investigated as basic BCIs due to their good performance with limited electrodes, and brief training session requirements. Here, a BCI is proposed which expands the methodology of brain-switches to design an interface composed of multiple brain-controlled buttons. The algorithm is designed as a system paced interface which can recognise 2 intentional-control tasks and a no-control state based on the activity during and following motor imagery in only 3 electroencephalogram channels. An online experiment was performed over 6 subjects to validate the algorithm, and the results show that a working BCI can be trained from a single calibration session and that the post motor imagery features are both informative and robust over multiple sessions."
23579176,"In this study we summarize the features that characterize the pre-movements and pre-motor imageries (before imagining the movement) electroencephalography (EEG) data in humans from both Neuroscientists' and Engineers' point of view. We demonstrate what the brain status is before a voluntary movement and how it has been used in practical applications such as brain computer interfaces (BCIs). Usually, in BCI applications, the focus of study is on the after-movement or motor imagery potentials. However, this study shows that it is possible to develop BCIs based on the before-movement or motor imagery potentials such as the Bereitschaftspotential (BP). Using the pre-movement or pre-motor imagery potentials, we can correctly predict the onset of the upcoming movement, its direction and even the limb that is engaged in the performance. This information can help in designing a more efficient rehabilitation tool as well as BCIs with a shorter response time which appear more natural to the users."
23578052,"We investigate whether an electroencephalography technique could be used for yes/no communication with auditory scanning. To be usable by the target group, i.e., minimally conscious individuals, such a brain-computer interface (BCI) has to be very simple and robust. This leads to the concept of a single-switch BCI (ssBCI). With an ssBCI it is possible to reliably detect one certain, individually trained, brain pattern of the individual, and use it to control all kinds of applications using yes/no responses. A total of 10 healthy volunteers (20-27 years) participated in an initial cue-based session with a motor imagery (MI) task after brisk passive feet/hand movement. Four of them reached MI classification accuracies above 70% and, thus, fulfilled the inclusion criterion for participation in the 2nd session. In the 2nd session, MI was used to communicate yes/no answers to a series of questions in an auditory scanning mode. Two of the three participants of the 2nd session were able to reliably communicate their intent with 90% or above correct and 0% false responses. This work showed, for the 1st time, the use of a ssBCI based on passive and imagined movements for communication in auditory scanning mode."
23565083,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) provide a non-muscular communication channel for patients with impairments of the motor system. A significant number of BCI users is unable to obtain voluntary control of a BCI-system in proper time. This makes methods that can be used to determine the aptitude of a user necessary. We hypothesized that integrity and connectivity of involved white matter connections may serve as a predictor of individual BCI-performance. Therefore, we analyzed structural data from anatomical scans and DTI of motor imagery BCI-users differentiated into high and low BCI-aptitude groups based on their overall performance. Using a machine learning classification method we identified discriminating structural brain trait features and correlated the best features with a continuous measure of individual BCI-performance. Prediction of the aptitude group of each participant was possible with near perfect accuracy (one error). Tissue volumetric analysis yielded only poor classification results. In contrast, the structural integrity and myelination quality of deep white matter structures such as the Corpus Callosum, Cingulum, and Superior Fronto-Occipital Fascicle were positively correlated with individual BCI-performance. This confirms that structural brain traits contribute to individual performance in BCI use."
23536381,"In this study, grey-based Hopfield neural network (GHNN), is proposed for the unsupervised analysis of motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Combined with segment selection and feature extraction, GHNN is used for the recognition of left and right MI data. A Gaussian-like filter is proposed to reduce noise, to further enhance performance of active segment selection. Features are extracted by coherence from wavelet data, and then discriminated by GHNN, which is an unsupervised approach suitable for the online classification of nonstationary biomedical signals. Compared to EEG data without segment selection, several usual features, and classifiers, the proposed system is potentially an analytic approach in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. "
23535455,"The primary objective was to test whether motor imagery (MI) questionnaires can be used to detect BCI 'illiterate'. The second objective was to test how different MI paradigms, with and without the physical presence of the goal of an action, influence a BCI classifier. Kinaesthetic (KI) and visual (VI) motor imagery questionnaires were administered to 30 healthy volunteers. Their EEG was recorded during a cue-based, simple imagery (SI) and goal oriented imagery (GOI). The strongest correlation (Pearson r(2)=0.53, p=1.6e-5) was found between KI and SI, followed by a moderate correlation between KI and GOI (r(2)=0.33, p=0.001) and a weak correlation between VI and SI (r(2)=0.21, p=0.022) and VI and GOI (r(2)=0.17, p=0.05). Classification accuracy was similar for SI (71.1 ± 7.8%) and GOI (70.5 ± 5.9%) though corresponding classification features differed in 70% participants. Compared to SI, GOI improved the classification accuracy in 'poor' imagers while reducing the classification accuracy in 'very good' imagers. The KI score could potentially be a useful tool to predict the performance of a MI based BCI. The physical presence of the object of an action facilitates motor imagination in 'poor' able-bodied imagers. Although this study shows results on able-bodied people, its general conclusions should be transferable to BCI based on MI for assisted rehabilitation of the upper extremities in patients."
23529075,"Compensating changes between a subjects' training and testing session in brain-computer interfacing (BCI) is challenging but of great importance for a robust BCI operation. We show that such changes are very similar between subjects, and thus can be reliably estimated using data from other users and utilized to construct an invariant feature space. This novel approach to learning from other subjects aims to reduce the adverse effects of common nonstationarities, but does not transfer discriminative information. This is an important conceptual difference to standard multisubject methods that, e.g., improve the covariance matrix estimation by shrinking it toward the average of other users or construct a global feature space. These methods do not reduces the shift between training and test data and may produce poor results when subjects have very different signal characteristics. In this paper, we compare our approach to two state-of-the-art multisubject methods on toy data and two datasets of EEG recordings from subjects performing motor imagery. We show that it can not only achieve a significant increase in performance, but also that the extracted change patterns allow for a neurophysiologically meaningful interpretation. "
23528750,"A major difficulty of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology is dealing with the noise of EEG and its signal variations. Previous works studied time-dependent non-stationarities for BCIs in which the user's mental task was independent of the device operation (e.g., the mental task was motor imagery and the operational task was a speller). However, there are some BCIs, such as those based on error-related potentials, where the mental and operational tasks are dependent (e.g., the mental task is to assess the device action and the operational task is the device action itself). The dependence between the mental task and the device operation could introduce a new source of signal variations when the operational task changes, which has not been studied yet. The aim of this study is to analyse task-dependent signal variations and their effect on EEG error-related potentials. The work analyses the EEG variations on the three design steps of BCIs: an electrophysiology study to characterize the existence of these variations, a feature distribution analysis and a single-trial classification analysis to measure the impact on the final BCI performance. The results demonstrate that a change in the operational task produces variations in the potentials, even when EEG activity exclusively originated in brain areas related to error processing is considered. Consequently, the extracted features from the signals vary, and a classifier trained with one operational task presents a significant loss of performance for other tasks, requiring calibration or adaptation for each new task. In addition, a new calibration for each of the studied tasks rapidly outperforms adaptive techniques designed in the literature to mitigate the EEG time-dependent non-stationarities."
23475381,"Voluntarily modulating neural activity plays a key role in brain-computer interface (BCI). In general, the self-regulated neural activation patterns are used in the current BCI systems involving the repetitive trainings with feedback for an attempt to achieve a high-quality control performance. With the limitation posed by the training procedure in most BCI studies, the present work aims to investigate whether directly modulating the neural activity by using an external method could facilitate the BCI control. We designed an experimental paradigm that combines anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with a motor imagery (MI)-based feedback EEG BCI system. Thirty-two young and healthy human subjects were randomly assigned to the real and sham stimulation groups to evaluate the effect of tDCS-induced EEG pattern changes on BCI classification accuracy. Results showed that the anodal tDCS obviously induces sensorimotor rhythm (SMR)-related event-related desynchronization (ERD) pattern changes in the upper-mu (10-14 Hz) and beta (14-26 Hz) rhythm components. Both the online and offline BCI classification results demonstrate that the enhancing ERD patterns could conditionally improve BCI performance. This pilot study suggests that the tDCS is a promising method to help the users to develop reliable BCI control strategy in a relatively short time."
23467061,"This study focuses on the identification of Motor Imagery (MI) tasks for the development of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) technologies combining Cross-Correlation and Logistic Regression (CC-LR) techniques. The proposed method is tested on two benchmark data sets, IVa and IVb of BCI Competition III, and the performance is evaluated through a 3-fold cross-validation procedure. The experimental outcomes are compared with two recently reported algorithms, R-Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) with aggregation and Clustering Technique (CT)-based Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) and also other four algorithms using data set IVa. The results demonstrate that our proposed method results in an improvement of at least 3.47% compared with the existing methods tested."
23453295,"In this paper, a non-invasive endogenous brain-machine interface (BMI) based on the correlation of EEG maps has been developed to work in real-time applications. The classifier is able to detect two mental tasks related to motor imagery with good success rates and stability. The BMI has been tested with four able-bodied volunteers. First, the users performed a training with visual feedback to adjust the classifier. Afterwards, the users carried out several trajectories in a visual interface controlling the cursor position with the BMI. In these tests, score and accuracy were measured. The results showed that the participants were able to follow the targets during the performed trajectory, proving that the EEG mapping correlation classifier is ready to work in more complex real-time applications aimed at helping people with a severe disability in their daily life. "
23414211,"The Rehabilitation Gaming System (RGS) has been designed as a flexible, virtual-reality (VR)-based device for rehabilitation of neurological patients. Recently, training of visuomotor processing with the RGS was shown to effectively improve arm function in acute and chronic stroke patients. It is assumed that the VR-based training protocol related to RGS creates conditions that aid recovery by virtue of the human mirror neuron system. Here, we provide evidence for this assumption by identifying the brain areas involved in controlling the catching of approaching colored balls in the virtual environment of the RGS. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging of 18 right-handed healthy subjects (24 ± 3 years) in both active and imagination conditions. We observed that the imagery of target catching was related to activation of frontal, parietal, temporal, cingulate and cerebellar regions. We interpret these activations in relation to object processing, attention, mirror mechanisms, and motor intention. Active catching followed an anticipatory mode, and resulted in significantly less activity in the motor control areas. Our results provide preliminary support for the hypothesis underlying RGS that this novel neurorehabilitation approach engages human mirror mechanisms that can be employed for visuomotor training."
23372028,"This study proposes a brain-computer interface (BCI) system for the recognition of single-trial electroencephalogram (EEG) data. With the combination of independent component analysis (ICA) and multiresolution asymmetry ratio, a support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify left and right finger lifting or motor imagery. First, ICA and similarity measures are proposed to eliminate the electrooculography (EOG) artifacts automatically. The features are then extracted from the wavelet data by means of an asymmetry ratio. Finally, the SVM classifier is used to discriminate between the features. Compared to the EEG data without EOG artifact removal, band power, and adoptive autoregressive (AAR) parameter features, the proposed system achieves promising results in BCI applications."
23367473,"In this paper, a hybrid BCI system was described for the control of a simulated wheelchair. This hybrid BCI was based on the motor imagery-based mu rhythm and the P300 potential. With our paradigm, the user may perform left- or right-hand imagery to control the direction (left or right turn) of the simulated wheelchair. Furthermore, a hybrid manner was used for speed control: e.g., foot imagery without button attention for deceleration and a specific button attention without any motor imagery for acceleration. An experiment based on a simulated wheelchair in virtual environment was conducted to assess the BCI control. Subjects effectively steered the simulated wheelchairs by controlling the direction and speed with our hybrid BCI system. Data analysis validated that our hybrid BCI system can be used to control the direction and speed of a simulated wheelchair."
23367470,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have traditionally been developed for paralyzed and locked-in individuals with no motor control. However, there is a much larger population of patients with some residual motor function as well as the general population of able-bodied individuals, both of whom could benefit significantly from BCIs. An important question that has yet to be systematically studied is: can subjects use BCIs simultaneously with overt motor activity? We present results from a preliminary study aimed at exploring this question. Three subjects used hand motor imagery in an electroencephalographic (EEG) BCI while simultaneously using a joystick to control a cursor. Particular attention was paid to preventing potential muscle artifacts from influencing imagery-based control. All three subjects were able to use the hybrid ""imagery+joystick"" mode of control over two days, demonstrating the ability to learn and significantly improve performance. These results suggest that subjects can potentially augment their normal human sensorimotor capability by exercising direct brain control over devices concurrently with overt motor control."
23367469,Motor imagery can be used to modulate sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) enabling detection of voltage fluctuations on the surface of the scalp using electroencephalographic (EEG) electrodes. Feedback is essential in learning how to intentionally modulate SMR in non-muscular communication using a brain-computer interface (BCI). A BCI that is not reliant upon the visual modality for feedback is an attractive means of communication for the blind and the vision impaired and to release the visual channel for other purposes during BCI usage. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of replacing the traditional visual feedback modality with stereo auditory feedback. Twenty participants split into equal groups took part in ten BCI sessions involving motor imagery. The visual feedback group performed best using two performance measures but did not show improvement over time whilst the auditory group improved as the study progressed. Multiple loudspeaker presentation of audio allows the listener to intuitively assign each of two classes to the corresponding lateral position in a free-field listening environment.
23367468,"Giving direct, continuous feedback on a brain state is common practice in motor imagery based brain-computer interfaces (BCI), but has not been reported for BCIs based on event-related potentials (ERP), where feedback is only given once after a sequence of stimuli. Potentially, direct feedback could allow the user to adjust his strategy during a running trial to obtain the required response. In order to test the usefulness of such feedback, directionally congruent vibrotactile feedback was given during an online auditory BCI experiment. Users received either no feedback, short feedback pulses or continuous feedback. The feedback conditions showed reduced performance both on a behavioral task and in terms of classification accuracy. Several explanations are discussed that give interesting starting points for further research on this topic."
23367117,"This paper presents a non-motor imagery tasks classification electroencephalography (EEG) based brain computer interface (BCI) for wheelchair control. It uses only two EEG channels and a better feature extractor to improve the portability and accuracy in the practical system. In addition, two different features extraction methods, power spectral density (PSD) and Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT) energy are compared to find a better method with improved classification accuracy using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based neural network classifier. The results from five subjects show that using the original eight channels with three tasks, accuracy between 76% and 85% is achieved. With only two channels in combination with the best chosen task using a PSD feature extractor, the accuracy is reduced to between 65% and 79%. However, the HHT based method provides an improved accuracy between 70% and 84% for the classification of three discriminative tasks using two EEG channels."
23366988,"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) based on the voluntary modulation of sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) induced by motor imagery are very prominent because allow a continuous control of the external device. Nevertheless, the design of a SMR-based BCI system that provides every user with a reliable BCI control from the first session, i.e., without extensive training, is still a big challenge. Considerable advances in this direction have been made by the machine learning co-adaptive calibration approach, which combines online adaptation techniques with subject learning in order to offer the user a feedback from the beginning of the experiment. Recently, based on offline analyses, we proposed the novel Common Spatial Patterns Patches (CSPP) technique as a good candidate to improve the co-adaptive calibration. CSPP is an ensemble of localized spatial filters, each of them optimized on subject-specific data by CSP analysis. Here, the evaluation of CSPP in online operation is presented for the first time. Results on three BCI-naive participants show indeed promising results. All three users reach the threshold criterion of 70% accuracy within one session, even one candidate for whom the weak SMR at rest predicted deficient BCI control. Concurrent recordings of the SMR during a relax condition as well as the course of BCI performance indicate a clear learning effect."
23366984,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) could act as a tool for rehabilitation of stroke patients due to the neural activity induced by motor imagery aided by real-time feedback of hemodynamic activation. When combined with functional electrical stimulation (FES) of the affected limb, BCI is expected to have an even greater benefit due to the contingency established between motor imagery and afferent, haptic feedback from stimulation. Yet, few studies have explored such an approach, presumably due to the difficulty in dissociating and thus decoding the hemodynamic response (HDR) between motor imagery and peripheral stimulation. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that NIRS signals elicited by motor imagery can be reliably discriminated from those due to FES, by first performing a univariate analysis of the NIRS signals, and subsequently by multivariate pattern classification. Our results showing that robust classification of motor imagery from the rest condition is possible support previous findings that imagery could be used to drive a BCI based on NIRS. More importantly, we demonstrate for the first time the successful classification of motor imagery and FES, indicating that it is technically feasible to implement a contingent NIRS-BCI with FES."
23366957,"Recently there has been an increase in the number of stroke patients with motor paralysis. Appropriate re-afferent sensory feedback synchronized with a voluntary motor intention would be effective for promoting neural plasticity in the stroke rehabilitation. Therefore, BCI technology is considered to be a promising approach in the neuro-rehabilitation. To estimate human motor intention, an event-related desynchronization (ERD), a feature of electroencephalogram (EEG) evoked by motor execution or motor imagery is usually used. However, there exists various factors that affect ERD production, and its neural mechanism is still an open question. As a preliminary stage, we evaluate mutual effects of intrinsic (voluntary motor imagery) and extrinsic (visual and somatosensory stimuli) factors on the ERD production. Experimental results indicate that these three factors are not always additively interacting with each other and affecting the ERD production."
23366871,"We propose a method of sparsifying EEG signals in the time domain for common spatial patterns (CSP) which are often used for feature extraction in brain computer interfaces (BCI). For accurate classification, it is important to analyze the period of time when a BCI user performs a mental task. We address this problem by optimizing the CSP cost with a time sparsification that removes unnecessary samples from the classification. We design a cost function that has CSP spatial weights and time window as optimization parameters. To find these parameters, we use alternating optimization. In an experiment on classification of motor-imagery EEG signals, the proposed method increased classification accuracy by 6% averaged over five subjects."
23366836,"Clinical studies had shown that EEG-based motor imagery Brain-Computer Interface (MI-BCI) combined with robotic feedback is effective in upper limb stroke rehabilitation, and transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) combined with other rehabilitation techniques further enhanced the facilitating effect of tDCS. This motivated the current clinical study to investigate the effects of combining tDCS with MI-BCI and robotic feedback compared to sham-tDCS for upper limb stroke rehabilitation. The stroke patients recruited were randomized to receive 20 minutes of tDCS or sham-tDCS prior to 10 sessions of 1-hour MI-BCI with robotic feedback for 2 weeks. The online accuracies of detecting motor imagery from idle condition were assessed and offline accuracies of classifying motor imagery from background rest condition were assessed from the EEG of the evaluation and therapy parts of the 10 rehabilitation sessions respectively. The results showed no evident differences between the online accuracies on the evaluation part from both groups, but the offline analysis on the therapy part yielded higher averaged accuracies for subjects who received tDCS (n=3) compared to sham-tDCS (n=2). The results suggest towards tDCS effect in modulating motor imagery in stroke, but a more conclusive result can be drawn when more data are collected in the ongoing study."
23366832,"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) process brain activity in real time, and mediate non-muscular interaction between and individual and the environment. The subserving algorithms can be used to provide a quantitative measurement of physiological or pathological cognitive processes - such as Motor Imagery (MI) - and feed it back the user. In this paper we propose the clinical application of a BCI-based rehabilitation device, to promote motor recovery after stroke. The BCI-based device and the therapy exploiting its use follow the same principles that drive classical neuromotor rehabilitation, and (i) provides the physical therapist with a monitoring instrument, to assess the patient's participation in the rehabilitative cognitive exercise; (ii) assists the patient in the practice of MI. The device was installed in the ward of a rehabilitation hospital and a group of 29 patients were involved in its testing. Among them, eight have already undergone a one-month training with the device, as an add-on to the regular therapy. An improved system, which includes analysis of Electromyographic (EMG) patterns and Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) of the arm muscles, is also under clinical evaluation. We found that the rehabilitation exercise based on BCI-mediated neurofeedback mechanisms enables a better engagement of motor areas with respect to motor imagery alone and thus it can promote neuroplasticity in brain regions affected by a cerebrovascular accident. Preliminary results also suggest that the functional outcome of motor rehabilitation may be improved by the use of the proposed device."
23366796,"Motor-impaired individuals such as tetraplegics could benefit from Brain-Computer Interfaces with an intuitive control mechanism, for instance for the control of a neuroprosthesis. Whereas BCI studies in healthy users commonly focus on motor imagery, for the eventual target users, namely patients, attempted movements could potentially be a more promising alternative. In the current study, EEG frequency information was used for classification of both imagined and attempted movements in tetraplegics. Although overall classification rates were considerably lower for tetraplegics than for the control group, both imagined and attempted movement were detectable. Classification rates were significantly higher for the attempted movement condition, with a mean rate of 77%. These results suggest that attempted movement is an appropriate task for BCI control in long-term paralysis patients."
23366624,"In this study we show how healthy subjects are able to use a non-invasive Motor Imagery (MI)-based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) to achieve linear control of an upper-limb neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) controlled neuroprosthesis in a simple binary target selection task. Linear BCI control can be achieved if two motor imagery classes can be discriminated with a reliability over 80% in single trial. The results presented in this work show that there was no significant loss of performance using the neuroprosthesis in comparison to MI where no stimulation was present. However, it is remarkable how different the experience of the users was in the same experiment. The stimulation either provoked a positive reinforcement feedback, or prevented the user from concentrating in the task."
23366538,"This study establishes the effectiveness of event related synchronisation (ERS) features for a system paced brain computer interface (BCI). In particular, the relationship between the duration of motor imagery (MI) and the quality of the features extracted from the ERS is investigated. To this end, two groups of users performed brief (2s) or sustained (4s) MI, and offline single trial BCIs were validated on each group based on features extracted from the EEG before, during and after MI. The BCIs were designed to recognise two intentional control tasks and a no-control state. Cross-validated results indicate that brief MI leads to more informative ERS features than sustained MI."
23366525,"A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) attempts to create a direct channel of communication between the brain and a computer. This is especially important for patients that are ""locked in"", as they have limited motor function and thus require an alternative means of communication. In this scope, a BCI can be controlled through the imagination of motor tasks, i.e. Motor Imagery. This thinking of actions produce changes on the ongoing Electroencephalogram (EEG), such as the so called Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD), that can be detected and measured. Traditionally, ERD is measured through the estimation of EEG signal power in specific frequency bands. In this work, a new method based on the phase information from the EEG channels, through the Phase-Locking Factor (PLF), is proposed. Both feature types were tested in real data obtained from 6 voluntary subjects, who performed 7 motor tasks in an EEG session. The features were classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers organized in a hierarchical structure. The results show that the PLF features are better, with an average accuracy of ≈ 86%, against an accuracy of ≈ 70% for the band power features. Although more research is still needed, the PLF measure shows promising results for use in a BCI system."
23366490,"Studies had shown that Motor Imagery-based Brain Computer Interface (MI-based BCI) system can be used as a therapeutic tool such as for stroke rehabilitation, but had shown that not all subjects could perform MI well. Studies had also shown that MI and passive movement (PM) could similarly activate the motor system. Although the idea of calibrating MI-based BCI system from PM data is promising, there is an inherent difference between features extracted from MI and PM. Therefore, there is a need for online learning to alleviate the difference and improve the performance. Hence, in this study we propose an online batch mode semi-supervised learning with KL distance weighting to update the model trained from the calibration session by using unlabeled data from the online test session. In this study, the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) algorithm is used to compute the most discriminative features of the EEG data in the calibration session and is updated iteratively on each band after a batch of online data is available for performing semi-supervised learning. The performance of the proposed method was compared with offline FBCSP, and results showed that the proposed method yielded slightly better results in comparison with offline FBCSP. The results also showed that the use of the model trained from PM for online session-to-session transfer compared to the use of the calibration model trained from MI yielded slightly better performance. The results suggest that using PM, due to its better performance and ease of recording is feasible and performance can be improved by using the proposed method to perform online semi-supervised learning while subjects perform MI."
23366266,"2-dimensional movement control is an interesting issue in Brain-Computer Interface. In this paper, we present a motor imagery based 2-D cursor control paradigm. To move the cursor to a random position, two-class motor imagery is simultaneously combined to output 2-D command, which directly points to target position. A center-out experiment (8 targets) is set to verify the proposed paradigm. The results of the online experiment (three subjects participated) validate the proposed strategy very well."
23366260,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) associates brain reorganization with a loss of cortical representation of paralyzed limbs. This effect is more pronounced in the chronic state, which can be reached approximately 6 months after the lesion. As many of the brain-computer interfaces (BCI) developed to date rely on the user motor activity, loss of this activity hinders the application of BCI technology for rehabilitation or motor compensation in these patients. This work is a preliminary study with three quadriplegic patients close to reaching the chronic state, addressing two questions: (i) whether it is still possible to use BCI technology to detect motor intention of the paralyzed hand at this state of chronicity; and (ii) whether it is better for the BCI decoding to rely on the motor attempt or the motor imagery of the hand as mental paradigm. The results show that one of the three patients had already lost the motor programs related to the hand, so it was not possible to build a motor-related BCI for him. For the other patients it was suitable to design a BCI based on both paradigms, but the results were better using motor attempt as it has broader activation associated patterns that are easier to recognize."
23366254,"We investigated the feasibility of discriminating four different motor imagery (MI) types from both hands using electroencephalography (EEG) through exploring underlying features related to MIs of thumb and fist from one hand. New spectral and spatial features related to different MIs were extracted using principal component analysis (PCA) and squared cross correlation (R(2)). Extracted features were evaluated using a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier, resulting in an average decoding accuracy about 50%, which is significantly higher than the guess level and the 95% confidence level of guess. The preliminary results demonstrate the great potential of extracting features from different MIs from same hands to generate control signals with more degrees of freedom (DOF) for non-invasive brain-computer interface applications. In addition, for movement related applications, especially for neuroprosthesis, the present study may facilitate the development of a non-invasive BCI, which is highly intuitive and based on users' spontaneous intentions."
23366247,"For synchronous brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigms tasks that utilize visual cues to direct the user, the neural signals extracted by the computer are representative of voluntary modulation as well as evoked responses. For these paradigms, the evoked potential is often overlooked as a source of artifact. In this paper, we put forth the hypothesis that cue priming, as a mechanism for attentional gating, is predictive of motor imagery performance, and thus a viable option for self-paced (asynchronous) BCI applications. We approximate attention by the amplitude features of visually evoked potentials (VEP)s found using two methods: trial matching to an average VEP template, and component matching to a VEP template defined using independent component analysis (ICA). Templates were used to rank trials that display high vs. low levels of fixation. Our results show that subject fixation, measured by VEP response, fails as a predictor of successful motor-imagery task completion. The implications for the BCI community and the possibilities for alternative cueing methods are given in the conclusions."
23366240,"Speech is our most natural form of communication and even though functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an increasingly popular modality for Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs), there are, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies on speech related tasks in fNIRS-based BCI. We conducted experiments on 5 subjects producing audible, silently uttered and imagined speech or do not produce any speech. For each of these speaking modes, we recorded fNIRS signals from the subjects performing these tasks and distinguish segments containing speech from those not containing speech, solely based on the fNIRS signals. Accuracies between 69% and 88% were achieved using support vector machines and a Mutual Information based Best Individual Feature approach. We are also able to discriminate the three speaking modes with 61% classification accuracy. We thereby demonstrate that speech is a very promising paradigm for fNIRS based BCI, as classification accuracies compare very favorably to those achieved in motor imagery BCIs with fNIRS."
23366237,"To detect the imagined limb movement from EEG for the use in BCI, the increase (ERS) and decrease (ERD) of the band power of the EEG originated from the sensorimotor cortex are commonly used. A spatial filter using neighboring channels is generally applied to the measured EEG for detecting such brain activity related to the motor imagery. However, the configuration and location of the spatial filter have been selected by the empirical method on trial-and-error basis. In this study, we recorded the EEG during motor imagery of left hand, right hand and feet from five subjects, and the ICA (independent component analysis) was applied to discover the spatial filters for extracting event-related EEG components of the motor imagery. It was suggested that the application of ICA might offer the experimenters appropriate local spatial filters, or at least, the ""initial guess"" for designing or selecting custom local spatial filters."
23366235,"The question of how many channels should be sed for classification remains a key issue in the study of Brain-Computer Interface. Several studies have shown that a reduced number of channels can achieve the optimal classification accuracy in the offline analysis of motor imagery paradigm, which does not have real-time feedback as in the online control. However, for the cursor movement control paradigm, it remains unclear as to how many channels should be selected in order to achieve the optimal classification. In the present study, we gradually increased the number of channels, and adopted the time-frequency-spatial synthesized method for left and right motor imagery classification. We compared the effect of increasing channel number in two datasets, an imagery-based cursor movement control dataset and a motor imagery tasks dataset. Our results indicated that for the former dataset, the more channels we used, the higher the accuracy rate was achieved, which is in contrast to the finding in the latter dataset that optimal performance was obtained at a subset number of channels. When gradually increasing the number of channels from 2 to all in the analysis of cursor movement control dataset, the average training and testing accuracies from three subjects improved from 68.7% to 90.4% and 63.7% to 87.7%, respectively."
23325145,"To date, most EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) studies have focused only on enhancing BCI performance in such areas as classification accuracy and information transfer rate. In practice, however, test-retest reliability of the developed BCI systems must also be considered for use in long-term, daily life applications. One factor that can affect the reliability of BCI systems is the slight displacement of EEG electrode locations that often occurs due to the removal and reattachment of recording electrodes. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare various feature extraction methods for motor-imagery-based BCI in terms of robustness to slight changes in electrode locations. To this end, EEG signals were recorded from three reference electrodes (Fz, C3, and C4) and from six additional electrodes located close to the reference electrodes with a 1-cm inter-electrode distance. Eight healthy participants underwent 180 trials of left- and right-hand motor imagery tasks. The performance of four different feature extraction methods [power spectral density (PSD), phase locking value (PLV), a combination of PSD and PLV, and cross-correlation (CC)] were evaluated using five-fold cross-validation and linear discriminant analysis, in terms of robustness to electrode location changes as well as regarding absolute classification accuracy. The quantitative evaluation results demonstrated that the use of either PSD- or CC-based features led to higher classification accuracy than the use of PLV-based features, while PSD-based features showed much higher sensitivity to changes in EEG electrode location than CC- or PLV-based features. Our results suggest that CC can be used as a promising feature extraction method in motor-imagery-based BCI studies, since it provides high classification accuracy along with being little affected by slight changes in the EEG electrode locations."
23290926,"The study aimed to improve brain-computer interface (BCI)-usability by using distinct control strategies and evaluating performance, brain activity and psychological variables on a long-term basis over several months. Fourteen able-bodied users participated in 10 sessions, plus a follow-up session. Users were trained to control an EEG-based 4-class BCI with the mental tasks, word association, mental subtraction, spatial navigation, and motor imagery. Eight users reached mean accuracies of 61-72% and managed to control all 4 classes above chance in single-sessions. Performance and brain patterns stayed stable over 10 weeks without training. Motor imagery showed the best performance and most distinct brain patterns. Participants' fear of incompetence decreased while the quality of their imagery and task ease increased over sessions. The evaluation of feedback differed between tasks and correlated with performance. Users can control a real-time 4-class BCI, driven by distinct mental tasks, with stable performance over months. However, general performance was rather low for effective BCI control in daily life. Possibilities for future optimizations to increase performance are discussed. The evaluation of alternatives to motor imagery, long-term BCI use, and psychological variables is important to improve usability for mental imagery-based BCIs."
23248335,"In this study, an analysis system embedding neuron-fuzzy prediction in feature extraction is proposed for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Wavelet-fractal features combined with neuro-fuzzy predictions are applied for feature extraction in motor imagery (MI) discrimination. The features are extracted from the electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded from participants performing left and right MI. Time-series predictions are performed by training 2 adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) for respective left and right MI data. Features are then calculated from the difference in multi-resolution fractal feature vector (MFFV) between the predicted and actual signals through a window of EEG signals. Finally, the support vector machine is used for classification. The proposed method estimates its performance in comparison with the linear adaptive autoregressive (AAR) model and the AAR time-series prediction of 6 participants from 2 data sets. The results indicate that the proposed method is promising in MI classification."
23220879,"Sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) are 8-30 Hz oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded from the scalp over sensorimotor cortex that change with movement and/or movement imagery. Many brain-computer interface (BCI) studies have shown that people can learn to control SMR amplitudes and can use that control to move cursors and other objects in one, two or three dimensions. At the same time, if SMR-based BCIs are to be useful for people with neuromuscular disabilities, their accuracy and reliability must be improved substantially. These BCIs often use spatial filtering methods such as common average reference (CAR), Laplacian (LAP) filter or common spatial pattern (CSP) filter to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of EEG. Here, we test the hypothesis that a new filter design, called an 'adaptive Laplacian (ALAP) filter', can provide better performance for SMR-based BCIs. An ALAP filter employs a Gaussian kernel to construct a smooth spatial gradient of channel weights and then simultaneously seeks the optimal kernel radius of this spatial filter and the regularization parameter of linear ridge regression. This optimization is based on minimizing the leave-one-out cross-validation error through a gradient descent method and is computationally feasible. Using a variety of kinds of BCI data from a total of 22 individuals, we compare the performances of ALAP filter to CAR, small LAP, large LAP and CSP filters. With a large number of channels and limited data, ALAP performs significantly better than CSP, CAR, small LAP and large LAP both in classification accuracy and in mean-squared error. Using fewer channels restricted to motor areas, ALAP is still superior to CAR, small LAP and large LAP, but equally matched to CSP. Thus, ALAP may help to improve the accuracy and robustness of SMR-based BCIs."
23204288,"Brain electrical activity recorded via electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most convenient means for brain-computer interface (BCI), and is notoriously noisy. The information of interest is located in well defined frequency bands, and a number of standard frequency estimation algorithms have been used for feature extraction. To deal with data nonstationarity, low signal-to-noise ratio, and closely spaced frequency bands of interest, we investigate the effectiveness of recently introduced multivariate extensions of empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) in motor imagery BCI. We show that direct multichannel processing via MEMD allows for enhanced localization of the frequency information in EEG, and, in particular, its noise-assisted mode of operation (NA-MEMD) provides a highly localized time-frequency representation. Comparative analysis with other state of the art methods on both synthetic benchmark examples and a well established BCI motor imagery dataset support the analysis."
23204287,"Stroke is one of the leading causes of adult disability with high economical and societal costs. In recent years, novel rehabilitation paradigms have been proposed to address the life-long plasticity of the brain to regain motor function. We propose a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI)-virtual reality (VR) system that combines a personalized motor training in a VR environment, exploiting brain mechanisms for action execution and observation, and a neuro-feedback paradigm using mental imagery as a way to engage secondary or indirect pathways to access undamaged cortico-spinal tracts. Furthermore, we present the development and validation experiments of the proposed system. More specifically, EEG data on nine naïve healthy subjects show that a simultaneous motor activity and motor imagery paradigm is more effective at engaging cortical motor areas and related networks to a larger extent. Additionally, we propose a motor imagery driven BCI-VR version of our system that was evaluated with nine different healthy subjects. Data show that users are capable of controlling a virtual avatar in a motor imagery training task that dynamically adjusts its difficulty to the capabilities of the user. User self-report questionnaires indicate enjoyment and acceptance of the proposed system."
23197181,"Motor imagery can be used to modulate sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) enabling detection of voltage fluctuations on the surface of the scalp using electroencephalographic electrodes. Feedback is essential in learning to modulate SMR for non-muscular communication using a brain-computer interface (BCI). A BCI not reliant upon the visual modality not only releases the visual channel for other uses but also offers an attractive means of communication for the physically impaired who are also blind or vision impaired. This study demonstrates the feasibility of replacing the traditional visual feedback modality with stereo auditory feedback. Results from a pilot study were used to select the most appropriate sounds for auditory feedback based on three options: broadband noise and two anechoic instrument samples. Subsequently, an SMR BCI was used to examine the effect on sensorimotor learning with broadband noise utilising a modified stereophonic presentation method. Twenty participants split into equal groups took part in ten sessions. The visual group performed best initially but did not improve over time whilst the auditory group improved as the study progressed. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using stereophonic auditory feedback with broadband noise as opposed to other auditory feedback presentation methods and sounds which are less intuitive."
23196555,"Because recovery of upper extremity (UE) function to a practical level has been difficult in many stroke patients, compensatory approaches have been emphasized. Based on researches indicating greater potential for brain plasticity, newer approaches targeting at functional restoration have been attempted. However, no intervention has been shown to be effective to improve hand function. We therefore devised a therapeutic approach to facilitate the use of the hemiparetic hand in daily life by combining EMG triggered electrical stimulation with a wrist splint, called hybrid assistive neuromuscular dynamic stimulation (HANDS). With HANDS, we demonstrated improved motor function, spasticity, functional scores and neurophysiological parameters in chronic stroke. With a RCT, we also demonstrated its effectiveness in subacute stroke. However, to be its candidates, electromyogram must be recorded from finger extensors, and it cannot be applied to patients with complete paralysis. For them, we recently developed a Brain Machine Interface (BMI) neurorehabilitation system. Based on analysis of volitionally decreased amplitudes of sensory motor rhythm during motor imagery involving extending the affected fingers, real-time visual feedback is provided. In patients with severe hemiparesis, we demonstrated its effectiveness with clinical scales, neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies. These newer interventions might offer useful neurorehabilitative tools for hemiparetic UE."
23181009,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are communication systems that allow people to send messages or commands without movement. BCIs rely on different types of signals in the electroencephalogram (EEG), typically P300s, steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP), or event-related desynchronization. Early BCI systems were often evaluated with a selected group of subjects. Also, many articles do not mention data from subjects who performed poorly. These and other factors have made it difficult to estimate how many people could use different BCIs. The present study explored how many subjects could use an SSVEP BCI. We recorded data from 53 subjects while they participated in 1-4 runs that were each 4 min long. During these runs, the subjects focused on one of four LEDs that each flickered at a different frequency. The eight channel EEG data were analyzed with a minimum energy parameter estimation algorithm and classified with linear discriminant analysis into one of the four classes. Online results showed that SSVEP BCIs could provide effective communication for all 53 subjects, resulting in a grand average accuracy of 95.5%. About 96.2% of the subjects reached an accuracy above 80%, and nobody was below 60%. This study showed that SSVEP based BCI systems can reach very high accuracies after only a very short training period. The SSVEP approach worked for all participating subjects, who attained accuracy well above chance level. This is important because it shows that SSVEP BCIs could provide communication for some users when other approaches might not work for them."
23123181,"Motor imagery tasks are well established procedures in brain computer interfaces, but are also used in the assessment of patients with disorders of consciousness. For testing awareness in unresponsive patients it is necessary to know the natural variance of brain responses to motor imagery in healthy subjects. We examined 22 healthy subjects using EEG in three conditions: movement of both hands, imagery of the same movement, and an instruction to hold both hands still. Single-subject non-parametric statistics were applied to the fast-Fourier transformed data. Most effects were found in the α- and β-frequency ranges over central electrodes, that is, in the μ-rhythm. We found significant power changes in 18 subjects during movement and in 11 subjects during motor imagery. In 8 subjects these changes were consistent over both conditions. The significant power changes during movement were a decrease of μ-rhythm. There were 2 subjects with an increase and 9 subjects with a decrease of μ-rhythm during imagery. α and β are the most responsive frequency ranges, but there is a minor number of subjects who show a synchronization instead of the more common desynchronization during motor imagery. A (de)synchronization of μ-rhythm can be considered to be a normal response."
23117792,"Extracting knowledge from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals has become an increasingly important research area in biomedical engineering. In addition to its clinical diagnostic purposes, in recent years there have been many efforts to develop brain computer interface (BCI) systems, which allow users to control external devices only by using their brain activity. Once the EEG signals have been acquired, it is necessary to use appropriate feature extraction and classification methods adapted to the user in order to improve the performance of the BCI system and, also, to make its design stage easier. This work introduces a novel fast adaptive BCI system for automatic feature extraction and classification of EEG signals. The proposed system efficiently combines several well-known feature extraction procedures and automatically chooses the most useful features for performing the classification task. Three different feature extraction techniques are applied: power spectral density, Hjorth parameters and autoregressive modelling. The most relevant features for linear discrimination are selected using a fast and robust wrapper methodology. The proposed method is evaluated using EEG signals from nine subjects during motor imagery tasks. Obtained experimental results show its advantages over the state-of-the-art methods, especially in terms of classification accuracy and computational cost."
23087607,"Recent studies show that scalp electroencephalography (EEG) as a non-invasive interface has great potential for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, one factor that has limited practical applications for EEG-based BCI so far is the difficulty to decode brain signals in a reliable and efficient way. This paper proposes a new robust processing framework for decoding of multi-class motor imagery (MI) that is based on five main processing steps. (i) Raw EEG segmentation without the need of visual artifact inspection. (ii) Considering that EEG recordings are often contaminated not just by electrooculography (EOG) but also other types of artifacts, we propose to first implement an automatic artifact correction method that combines regression analysis with independent component analysis for recovering the original source signals. (iii) The significant difference between frequency components based on event-related (de-) synchronization and sample entropy is then used to find non-contiguous discriminating rhythms. After spectral filtering using the discriminating rhythms, a channel selection algorithm is used to select only relevant channels. (iv) Feature vectors are extracted based on the inter-class diversity and time-varying dynamic characteristics of the signals. (v) Finally, a support vector machine is employed for four-class classification. We tested our proposed algorithm on experimental data that was obtained from dataset 2a of BCI competition IV (2008). The overall four-class kappa values (between 0.41 and 0.80) were comparable to other models but without requiring any artifact-contaminated trial removal. The performance showed that multi-class MI tasks can be reliably discriminated using artifact-contaminated EEG recordings from a few channels. This may be a promising avenue for online robust EEG-based BCI applications."
23071707,"Brain computer interface (BCI) technology has been proposed for motor neurorehabilitation, motor replacement and assistive technologies. It is an open question whether proprioceptive feedback affects the regulation of brain oscillations and therefore BCI control. We developed a BCI coupled on-line with a robotic hand exoskeleton for flexing and extending the fingers. 24 healthy participants performed five different tasks of closing and opening the hand: (1) motor imagery of the hand movement without any overt movement and without feedback, (2) motor imagery with movement as online feedback (participants see and feel their hand, with the exoskeleton moving according to their brain signals, (3) passive (the orthosis passively opens and closes the hand without imagery) and (4) active (overt) movement of the hand and rest. Performance was defined as the difference in power of the sensorimotor rhythm during motor task and rest and calculated offline for different tasks. Participants were divided in three groups depending on the feedback receiving during task 2 (the other tasks were the same for all participants). Group 1 (n = 9) received contingent positive feedback (participants' sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) desynchronization was directly linked to hand orthosis movements), group 2 (n = 8) contingent ""negative"" feedback (participants' sensorimotor rhythm synchronization was directly linked to hand orthosis movements) and group 3 (n = 7) sham feedback (no link between brain oscillations and orthosis movements). We observed that proprioceptive feedback (feeling and seeing hand movements) improved BCI performance significantly. Furthermore, in the contingent positive group only a significant motor learning effect was observed enhancing SMR desynchronization during motor imagery without feedback in time. Furthermore, we observed a significantly stronger SMR desynchronization in the contingent positive group compared to the other groups during active and passive movements. To summarize, we demonstrated that the use of contingent positive proprioceptive feedback BCI enhanced SMR desynchronization during motor tasks."
23037775,We investigated neurophysiologic correlates of individual differences in the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) in the human electroencephalography (EEG) during motor imagery. The ability of modulating SMRs to different motor imageries was correlated with the strength of alpha phase synchronization across frontal and central sensorimotor areas. The results suggest that fronto-central coupling may elucidate individual variations in SMR modulation that is essential for using SMR-based brain-computer interfaces.
23033330,"A new multiclass brain-computer interface (BCI) based on the modulation of sensorimotor oscillations by imagining movements is described. By the application of advanced signal processing tools, statistics and machine learning, this BCI system offers: 1) asynchronous mode of operation, 2) automatic selection of user-dependent parameters based on an initial calibration, 3) incremental update of the classifier parameters from feedback data. The signal classification uses spatially filtered signals and is based on spectral power estimation computed in individualized frequency bands, which are automatically identified by a specially tailored AR-based model. Relevant features are chosen by a criterion based on Mutual Information. Final recognition of motor imagery is effectuated by a multinomial logistic regression classifier. This BCI system was evaluated in two studies. In the first study, five participants trained the ability to imagine movements of the right hand, left hand and feet in response to visual cues. The accuracy of the classifier was evaluated across four training sessions with feedback. The second study assessed the information transfer rate (ITR) of the BCI in an asynchronous application. The subjects' task was to navigate a cursor along a computer rendered 2-D maze. A peak information transfer rate of 8.0 bit/min was achieved. Five subjects performed with a mean ITR of 4.5 bit/min and an accuracy of 74.84%. These results demonstrate that the use of automated interfaces to reduce complexity for the intended operator (outside the laboratory) is indeed possible. The signal processing and classifier source code embedded in BCI2000 is available from https://www.brain-project.org/downloads.html."
23031175,"To test the feasibility of controlling a computer cursor asynchronously in two dimensions using one subdural electrode. Proof of concept study. Acute care hospital in Toronto, Canada. A 68-year-old woman with a subdural electrode implanted for the treatment of essential tremor (ET) using direct brain stimulation of the primary motor cortex (MI). Power changes in the electrocorticography signals were used to implement a ""brain  switch"". To activate the switch the subject had to decrease the power in the 7-13 Hz frequency range using motor imagery of the left hand. The brain switch was connected to a system for asynchronous control of movement in two dimensions. Each time the user reduced the amplitude  in the 7-13 Hz frequency band below an experimentally defined threshold the direction of cursor changed randomly. The new direction was always different from those previously rejected ensuring the convergence of the system on the desired direction. Training time, time and number of switch activations required to reach specific targets, information transfer rate. The user was able to control the cursor to specific targets on the screen after only 15 minutes of training. Each target was reached in 51.7 ± 40.2  seconds (mean ± SD) and after 9.4 ± 6.8 switch activations. Information transfer rate of the system was estimated to be 0.11 bit/second.

22995776,"Although we feel, see, and experience our hands as our own (body or hand ownership), recent research has shown that illusory hand ownership can be induced for fake or virtual hands and may be useful for neuroprosthetics and brain-computer interfaces. Despite the vast amount of behavioral data on illusory hand ownership, neuroimaging studies are rare, in particular electrophysiological studies. Thus, while the neural systems underlying hand ownership are relatively well described, the spectral signatures of body ownership as measured by electroencephalography (EEG) remain elusive. Here we induced illusory hand ownership in an automated, computer-controlled manner using virtual reality while recording 64-channel EEG and found that illusory hand ownership is reflected by a body-specific modulation in the mu-band over fronto-parietal cortex. In a second experiment in the same subjects, we then show that mu as well as beta-band activity in highly similar fronto-parietal regions was also modulated during a motor imagery task often used in paradigms employing non-invasive brain-computer interface technology. These data provide insights into the electrophysiological brain mechanisms of illusory hand ownership and their strongly overlapping mechanisms with motor imagery in fronto-parietal cortex. They also highlight the potential of combining high-resolution EEG with virtual reality setups and automatized stimulation protocols for systematic, reproducible stimulus presentation in cognitive neuroscience, and may inform the design of non-invasive brain-computer interfaces."
22954880,"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have been used to assist people with impairments since many years. In most of these applications the BCI is intended to substitute functions the user is no longer able to perform without help. For example BCIs could be used for communication and for control of devices like robotic arms, wheelchairs or also orthoses and prostheses. Another approach is not to replace the motor function itself by controlling a BCI, but to utilize a BCI for rehabilitation that enables the user to restore normal or ""more normal"" motor function. Motor imagery (MI) itself is a common strategy for motor rehabilitation in stroke patients. The idea of this paper is it to assist the MI by presenting online feedback about the imagination to the user. A BCI is presented that classifies MI of the left hand versus the right hand. Feedback is given to the user with two different strategies. One time by an abstract bar feedback, and the second time by a 3-D virtual reality environment: The left and right hand of an avatar in the 1st person's perspective in presented to him/her. If a motor imagery is detected, the according hand of the avatar moves. Preliminary tests were done on three healthy subjects. Offline analysis was then performed to (1) demonstrate the feasibility of the new, immersive, 3-D feedback strategy, (2) to compare it with the quite common bar feedback strategy and (3) to optimize the classification algorithm that detects the MI."
22949044,"The spatial weights for electrodes called common spatial pattern (CSP) are known to be effective in EEG signal classification for motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). To achieve accurate classification in CSP, it is necessary to find frequency bands that relate to brain activities associated with BCI tasks. Several methods that determine such a set of frequency bands have been proposed. However, the existing methods cannot find the multiple frequency bands by using only learning data. To address this problem, we propose discriminative filter bank CSP (DFBCSP) that designs finite impulse response filters and the associated spatial weights by optimizing an objective function which is a natural extension of that of CSP. The optimization is conducted by sequentially and alternatively solving subproblems into which the original problem is divided. By experiments, it is shown that DFBCSP can effectively extract discriminative features for MI-BCI. Moreover, experimental results exhibit that DFBCSP can detect and extract the bands related to brain activities of motor imagery."
22928842,"The difficulty of distinguishing disorders of consciousness from certain disorders of communication leads to the possibility of false diagnosis. Our aim is to communicate with patients with disorders of consciousness through asking them to answer questions with ""yes/no"" by performing mental imagery tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A 1.5 T fMRI study with 5 patients and a control group is presented. Speech comprehension, mental imagery, and question-answer tests were performed. The imagery task of mental calculation produced equally distinct activation patterns when compared to navigation and motor imagery in controls. For controls, we could infer answers to questions based on imagery activations. Two patients produced activations in similar areas to controls for certain imagery tasks, however, no activations were observed for the question-answer task. The results from 2 patients provide independent support of similar work by others with 3 T fMRI, and demonstrate broader clinical utility for these tests at 1.5 T despite lower signal-to-noise ratio. Based on the control results, mental calculation adds a robust imagery task for use in future studies of this kind."
22915261,"Minimally conscious state (MCS) is a condition of severely altered consciousness, in which patients appear to be wakeful and exhibit fluctuating but reproducible signs of awareness. MCS patients do not respond and are therefore dependent on others. In agreement with the embodied cognition assumption that motor actions influence our cognition, the absence of movement and the decrease in consequences for any type of covert or overt response may cause an extinction of goal-directed thinking. Brain-computer interfaces, which allow a direct output without muscular involvement, may be used to promote goal-directed thinking by allowing the performance of spatial and motor imagery tasks and could facilitate the interaction of MCS patients with their environment, possibly regaining some degree of communication and autonomy."
22895995,"New strategies like motor imagery based brain-computer interfaces, which use brain signals such as event-related desynchronization (ERD) or event-related synchronization (ERS) for motor rehabilitation after a stroke, are undergoing investigation. However, little is known about the relationship between ERD and ERS patterns and the degree of stroke impairment. The aim of this work was to clarify this relationship. EEG during motor imagery and execution were measured in 29 patients with first-ever monolateral stroke causing any degree of motor deficit in the upper limb. The strength and laterality of the ERD or ERS patterns were correlated with the scores of the European Stroke Scale, the Medical Research Council, and the Modified Ashworth Scale. Mean age of the patients was 58 ± 15 years; mean time from the incident was 4 ± 4 months. Stroke lesions were cortical (n=8), subcortical (n=11), or mixed (n=10), attributable to either an ischemic event (n=26) or a hemorrhage (n=3), affecting the right (n=16) or left (n=13) hemisphere. Higher impairment was related to stronger ERD in the unaffected hemisphere and higher spasticity was related to stronger ERD in the affected hemisphere. Both were related to a relatively stronger ERS in the affected hemisphere. The results of this study may have implications for the design of potential poststroke rehabilitation interventions based on brain-computer interface technologies that use neurophysiological signals like ERD or ERS as neural substrates for the mutual interaction between brain and machine and, ultimately, help stroke patients to regain motor control."
22872668,"Motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface systems (BCIs) normally use a powerful spatial filtering and classification method to maximize their performance. The common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is a widely used spatial filtering method for MI-based BCIs. In this work, we propose a new sparse representation-based classification (SRC) scheme for MI-based BCI applications. Sensorimotor rhythms are extracted from electroencephalograms and used for classification. The proposed SRC method utilizes the frequency band power and CSP algorithm to extract features for classification. We analyzed the performance of the new method using experimental datasets. The results showed that the SRC scheme provides highly accurate classification results, which were better than those obtained using the well-known linear discriminant analysis classification method. The enhancement of the proposed method in terms of the classification accuracy was verified using cross-validation and a statistical paired t-test (p < 0.001)."
22851229,"Cortical neuroprostheses for movement restoration require developing models for relating neural activity to desired movement. Previous studies have focused on correlating single-unit activities (SUA) in primary motor cortex to volitional arm movements in able-bodied primates. The extent of the cortical information relevant to arm movements remaining in severely paralyzed individuals is largely unknown. We record intracortical signals using a microelectrode array chronically implanted in the precentral gyrus of a person with tetraplegia, and estimate positions of imagined single-joint arm movements. Using visually guided motor imagery, the participant imagined performing eight distinct single-joint arm movements, while SUA, multispike trains (MSP), multiunit activity, and local field potential time (LFPrms), and frequency signals (LFPstft) were recorded. Using linear system identification, imagined joint trajectories were estimated with 20-60% variance explained, with wrist flexion/extension predicted the best and pronation/supination the poorest. Statistically, decoding of MSP and LFPstft yielded estimates that equaled those of SUA. Including multiple signal types in a decoder increased prediction accuracy in all cases. We conclude that signals recorded from a single restricted region of the precentral gyrus in this person with tetraplegia contained useful information regarding the intended movements of upper extremity joints."
22841698,"Most brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are non-time-restraint systems. However, the method used to design a real-time BCI paradigm for controlling unstable devices is still a challenging problem. This paper presents a real-time feedback BCI paradigm for controlling an inverted pendulum on a cart (IPC). In this paradigm, sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) were recorded using 15 active electrodes placed on the surface of the subject's scalp. Subsequently, common spatial pattern (CSP) was used as the basic filter to extract spatial patterns. Finally, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to translate the patterns into control commands that could stabilize the simulated inverted pendulum. Offline trainings were employed to teach the subjects to execute corresponding mental tasks, such as left/right hand motor imagery. Five subjects could successfully balance the online inverted pendulum for more than 35s. The results demonstrated that BCIs are able to control nonlinear unstable devices. Furthermore, the demonstration and extension of real-time continuous control might be useful for the real-life application and generalization of BCI."
22801528,"The influence of pre-stimulus ongoing brain activity on post-stimulus task performance has recently been analyzed in several studies. While pre-stimulus activity in the parieto-occipital area has been exhaustively investigated with congruent results, less is known about the sensorimotor areas, for which studies reported inconsistent findings. In this work, the topic is addressed in a brain-computer interface (BCI) setting based on modulations of sensorimotor rhythms (SMR). The goal is to assess whether and how pre-stimulus SMR activity influences the successive task execution quality and consequently the classification performance. Grand average data of 23 participants performing right and left hand motor imagery were analyzed. Trials were separated into two groups depending on the SMR amplitude in the 1000 ms interval preceding the cue, and classification by common spatial patterns (CSPs) preprocessing and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was carried out in the post-stimulus time interval, i.e., during the task execution. The correlation between trial group and classification performance was assessed by an analysis of variance. As a result of this analysis, trials with higher SMR amplitude in the 1000 ms interval preceding the cue yielded significantly better classification performance than trials with lower amplitude. A further investigation of brain activity patterns revealed that this increase in accuracy is mainly due to the persistence of a higher SMR amplitude over the ipsilateral hemisphere. Our findings support the idea that exploiting information about the ongoing SMR might be the key to boosting performance in future SMR-BCI experiments and motor related tasks in general."
22791228,"Electroencephalogram-based brain-computer interface (BCI) has been developed as a new neurorehabilitative tool for patients with severe hemiparesis. However, its application has been limited because of difficulty detecting stable brain signals from the affected hemisphere. It has been reported that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can modulate event-related desynchronization (ERD) in healthy persons. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that anodal tDCS could modulate ERD in patients with severe hemiparetic stroke. The participants were six patients with chronic hemiparetic stroke (mean age, 56.8 ± 9.5 years; mean time from the onset, 70.0 ± 19.6 months; Fugl-Meyer Assessment upper extremity motor score, 30.8 ± 16.5). We applied anodal tDCS (10 min, 1 mA) and sham stimulation over the affected primary motor cortex in a random order. ERD of the mu rhythm (mu ERD) with motor imagery of extension of the affected finger was assessed before and after anodal tDCS and sham stimulation. Mu ERD of the affected hemisphere increased significantly after anodal tDCS, whereas it did not change after sham stimulation. Our results show that anodal tDCS can increase mu ERD in patients with hemiparetic stroke, indicating that anodal tDCS could be used as a conditioning tool for BCI in stroke patients."
22749465,"The aim of this study was to examine the temporal stability of event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/S) patterns over several sessions as a function of mental task, frequency band, brain region and time interval during the imagery period. Nine volunteers participated in four sessions within 2 weeks of multi-channel EEG recordings. They performed seven mental tasks (i.e. mental rotation, word association, auditory imagery, mental subtraction, spatial navigation, imagery of familiar faces, motor imagery) during 7-s imagery periods. Cronbach's alpha coefficients were calculated over sessions to evaluate the stability of ERD/S values. The word association, mental subtraction and spatial navigation task showed highest stability. Cronbach's alpha coefficients were highest in the alpha bands (7-10, 10-13 Hz), poorer in the beta bands (13-20, 20-30 Hz) and poorest in the theta band (4-7 Hz). In the majority of tasks, the first time interval and posterior left regions showed highest stability and strongest ERD in the alpha and beta bands. Stability of ERD/S is strongly dependent on the specific task and differs between time intervals of the imagery period. Furthermore, stability was related to ERD in the alpha and beta bands. The reliability of brain activation patterns is highly relevant for brain-computer interface developments."
22748322,"Human communication entirely depends on the functional integrity of the neuromuscular system. This is devastatingly illustrated in clinical conditions such as the so-called locked-in syndrome (LIS), in which severely motor-disabled patients become incapable to communicate naturally--while being fully conscious and awake. For the last 20 years, research on motor-independent communication has focused on developing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) implementing neuroelectric signals for communication (e.g., [2-7]), and BCIs based on electroencephalography (EEG) have already been applied successfully to concerned patients. However, not all patients achieve proficiency in EEG-based BCI control. Thus, more recently, hemodynamic brain signals have also been explored for BCI purposes. Here, we introduce the first spelling device based on fMRI. By exploiting spatiotemporal characteristics of hemodynamic responses, evoked by performing differently timed mental imagery tasks, our novel letter encoding technique allows translating any freely chosen answer (letter-by-letter) into reliable and differentiable single-trial fMRI signals. Most importantly, automated letter decoding in real time enables back-and-forth communication within a single scanning session. Because the suggested spelling device requires only little effort and pretraining, it is immediately operational and possesses high potential for clinical applications, both in terms of diagnostics and establishing short-term communication with nonresponsive and severely motor-impaired patients."
22746218,"Ten individuals were divided into two feedback and no-feedback groups. The effect of abstract visual feedback was investigated in these two groups. Using eight electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes, the induced event-related desynchronization/synchronization of the EEG of three motor imagery tasks (left hand, right hand, and right foot) was analyzed by wavelet and spatial filtering methods. Linear discriminant analysis was used to classify the three imagery tasks. Each imagery task's total length was set to 3 s and 1 s of it was used for the classification. The classification result was shown to the subjects of the feedback group in a real-time manner as an abstract visual feedback. While the paired t-test of the first and third sessions of the training days confirmed the improvement of the motor imagery learning in the feedback group (p<0.01), the motor imagery learning of the no-feedback group was not significant."
22715494,"In this study, an electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis system is proposed for single-trial classification of both motor imagery (MI) and finger-lifting EEG data. Applying event-related brain potential (ERP) data acquired from the sensorimotor cortices, the system mainly consists of three procedures; enhanced active segment selection, feature extraction, and classification. In addition to the original use of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Student 2-sample t statistics, the two-dimensional (2D) anisotropic Gaussian filter further refines the selection of active segments. The multiresolution fractal features are then extracted from wavelet data by using proposed modified fractal dimension. Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) is used for classification. Compared to original active segment selection, with several popular features and classifier on both the MI and finger-lifting data from 2 data sets, the results indicate that the proposed method is promising in EEG classification."
22692936,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are used to translate brain activity signals into control signals for external devices. Currently, it is difficult for BCI systems to provide the multiple independent control signals necessary for the multi-degree continuous control of a wheelchair. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a hybrid BCI that uses the motor imagery-based mu rhythm and the P300 potential to control a brain-actuated simulated or real wheelchair. The objective of the hybrid BCI is to provide a greater number of commands with increased accuracy to the BCI user. Our paradigm allows the user to control the direction (left or right turn) of the simulated or real wheelchair using left- or right-hand imagery. Furthermore, a hybrid manner can be used to control speed. To decelerate, the user imagines foot movement while ignoring the flashing buttons on the graphical user interface (GUI). If the user wishes to accelerate, then he/she pays attention to a specific flashing button without performing any motor imagery. Two experiments were conducted to assess the BCI control; both a simulated wheelchair in a virtual environment and a real wheelchair were tested. Subjects steered both the simulated and real wheelchairs effectively by controlling the direction and speed with our hybrid BCI system. Data analysis validated the use of our hybrid BCI system to control the direction and speed of a wheelchair."
22666377,"Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) often use spatial filters to improve signal-to-noise ratio of task-related EEG activities. To obtain robust spatial filters, large amounts of labeled data, which are often expensive and labor-intensive to obtain, need to be collected in a training procedure before online BCI control. Several studies have recently developed zero-training methods using a session-to-session scenario in order to alleviate this problem. To our knowledge, a state-to-state translation, which applies spatial filters derived from one state to another, has never been reported. This study proposes a state-to-state, zero-training method to construct spatial filters for extracting EEG changes induced by motor imagery. Independent component analysis (ICA) was separately applied to the multi-channel EEG in the resting and the motor imagery states to obtain motor-related spatial filters. The resultant spatial filters were then applied to single-trial EEG to differentiate left- and right-hand imagery movements. On a motor imagery dataset collected from nine subjects, comparable classification accuracies were obtained by using ICA-based spatial filters derived from the two states (motor imagery: 87.0%, resting: 85.9%), which were both significantly higher than the accuracy achieved by using monopolar scalp EEG data (80.4%). The proposed method considerably increases the practicality of BCI systems in real-world environments because it is less sensitive to electrode misalignment across different sessions or days and does not require annotated pilot data to derive spatial filters."
22645108,"Robot-assisted training may improve motor function in some hemiparetic patients after stroke, but no physiological predictor of rehabilitation progress is reliable. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) may serve as a method to assess and predict changes in the motor network. The authors examined the effects of upper-extremity robot-assisted rehabilitation (MANUS) versus an electroencephalography-based brain computer interface setup with motor imagery (MI EEG-BCI) and compared pretreatment and posttreatment RS-fMRI. In all, 9 adults with upper-extremity paresis were trained for 4 weeks with a MANUS shoulder-elbow robotic rehabilitation paradigm. In 3 participants, robot-assisted movement began if no voluntary movement was initiated within 2 s. In 6 participants, MI-BCI-based movement was initiated if motor imagery was detected. RS-fMRI and Fugl-Meyer (FM) upper-extremity motor score were assessed before and after training. . The individual gain in FM scores over 12 weeks could be predicted from functional connectivity changes (FCCs) based on the pre-post differences in RS-fMRI measurements. Both the FM gain and FCC were numerically higher in the MI-BCI group. Increases in FC of the supplementary motor area, the contralesional and ipsilesional motor cortex, and parts of the visuospatial system with mostly association cortex regions and the cerebellum correlated with individual upper-extremity function improvement. FCC may predict the steepness of individual motor gains. Future training could therefore focus on directly inducing these beneficial increases in FC. Evaluation of the treatment groups suggests that MI is a potential facilitator of such neuroplasticity."
22626911,"In this paper, we present a new web browser based on a two-dimensional (2D) brain-computer interface (BCI) mouse, where our major concern is the selection of an intended target in a multi-target web page. A real-world web page may contain tens or even hundreds of targets, including hyperlinks, input elements, buttons, etc. In this case, a target filter designed in our system can be used to exclude most of those targets of no interest. Specifically, the user filters the targets of no interest out by inputting keywords with a P300-based speller, while keeps those containing the keywords. Such filtering largely facilitates the target selection task based on our BCI mouse. When there are only several targets in a web page (either an original sparse page or a target-filtered page), the user moves the mouse toward the target of interest using his/her electroencephalographic signal. The horizontal movement and vertical movement are controlled by motor imagery and P300 potential, respectively. If the mouse encounters a target of no interest, the user rejects it and continues to move the mouse. Otherwise the user selects the target and activates it. With the collaboration of the target filtering and a series of mouse movements and target selections/rejections, the user can select an intended target in a web page. Based on our browser system, common navigation functions, including history rolling forward and backward, hyperlink selection, page scrolling, text input, etc, are available. The system has been tested on seven subjects. Experimental results not only validated the efficacy of the proposed method, but also showed that free internet surfing with a BCI mouse is feasible."
22498703,"This study aims to propose an effective and practical paradigm for a brain-computer interface (BCI)-based 2-D virtual wheelchair control. The paradigm was based on the multi-class discrimination of spatiotemporally distinguishable phenomenon of event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) in electroencephalogram signals associated with motor execution/imagery of right/left hand movement. Comparing with traditional method using ERD only, where bilateral ERDs appear during left/right hand mental tasks, the 2-D control exhibited high accuracy within a short time, as incorporating ERS into the paradigm hypothetically enhanced the spatiotemoral feature contrast of ERS versus ERD. We also expected users to experience ease of control by including a noncontrol state. In this study, the control command was sent discretely whereas the virtual wheelchair was moving continuously. We tested five healthy subjects in a single visit with two sessions, i.e., motor execution and motor imagery. Each session included a 20 min calibration and two sets of games that were less than 30 min. Average target hit rate was as high as 98.4% with motor imagery. Every subject achieved 100% hit rate in the second set of wheelchair control games. The average time to hit a target 10 m away was about 59 s, with 39 s for the best set. The superior control performance in subjects without intensive BCI training suggested a practical wheelchair control paradigm for BCI users."
22481835,"System calibration and user training are essential for operating motor imagery based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. These steps are often unintuitive and tedious for the user, and do not necessarily lead to a satisfactory level of control. We present an Adaptive BCI framework that provides feedback after only minutes of autocalibration in a two-class BCI setup. During operation, the system recurrently reselects only one out of six predefined logarithmic bandpower features (10-13 and 16-24 Hz from Laplacian derivations over C3, Cz, and C4), specifically, the feature that exhibits maximum discriminability. The system then retrains a linear discriminant analysis classifier on all available data and updates the online paradigm with the new model. Every retraining step is preceded by an online outlier rejection. Operating the system requires no engineering knowledge other than connecting the user and starting the system. In a supporting study, ten out of twelve novice users reached a criterion level of above 70% accuracy in one to three sessions (10-80 min online time) of training, with a median accuracy of 80.2 ± 11.3% in the last session. We consider the presented system a positive first step towards fully autocalibrating motor imagery BCIs."
22479236,"The Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm is an effective and popular method for classifying 2-class motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) data, but its effectiveness depends on the subject-specific frequency band. This paper presents the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) algorithm to optimize the subject-specific frequency band for CSP on Datasets 2a and 2b of the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Competition IV. Dataset 2a comprised 4 classes of 22 channels EEG data from 9 subjects, and Dataset 2b comprised 2 classes of 3 bipolar channels EEG data from 9 subjects. Multi-class extensions to FBCSP are also presented to handle the 4-class EEG data in Dataset 2a, namely, Divide-and-Conquer (DC), Pair-Wise (PW), and One-Versus-Rest (OVR) approaches. Two feature selection algorithms are also presented to select discriminative CSP features on Dataset 2b, namely, the Mutual Information-based Best Individual Feature (MIBIF) algorithm, and the Mutual Information-based Rough Set Reduction (MIRSR) algorithm. The single-trial classification accuracies were presented using 10 × 10-fold cross-validations on the training data and session-to-session transfer on the evaluation data from both datasets. Disclosure of the test data labels after the BCI Competition IV showed that the FBCSP algorithm performed relatively the best among the other submitted algorithms and yielded a mean kappa value of 0.569 and 0.600 across all subjects in Datasets 2a and 2b respectively."
22476215,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) allows the use of brain activities for people to directly communicate with the external world or to control external devices without participation of any peripheral nerves and muscles. Motor imagery is one of the most popular modes in the research field of brain-computer interface. Although motor imagery BCI has some advantages compared with other modes of BCI, such as asynchronization, it is necessary to require training sessions before using it. The performance of trained BCI system depends on the quality of training samples or the subject engagement. In order to improve training effect and decrease training time, we proposed a new paradigm where subjects participated in training more actively than in the traditional paradigm. In the traditional paradigm, a cue (to indicate what kind of motor imagery should be imagined during the current trial) is given to the subject at the beginning of a trial or during a trial, and this cue is also used as a label for this trial. It is usually assumed that labels for trials are accurate in the traditional paradigm, although subjects may not have performed the required or correct kind of motor imagery, and trials may thus be mislabeled. And then those mislabeled trials give rise to interference during model training. In our proposed paradigm, the subject is required to reconfirm the label and can correct the label when necessary. This active training paradigm may generate better training samples with fewer inconsistent labels because it overcomes mistakes when subject's motor imagination does not match the given cues. The experiments confirm that our proposed paradigm achieves better performance; the improvement is significant according to statistical analysis."
22431526,"As there has been a paradigm shift in the learning load from a human subject to a computer, machine learning has been considered as a useful tool for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian framework for discriminative feature extraction for motor imagery classification in an EEG-based BCI in which the class-discriminative frequency bands and the corresponding spatial filters are optimized by means of the probabilistic and information-theoretic approaches. In our framework, the problem of simultaneous spatiospectral filter optimization is formulated as the estimation of an unknown posterior probability density function (pdf) that represents the probability that a single-trial EEG of predefined mental tasks can be discriminated in a state. In order to estimate the posterior pdf, we propose a particle-based approximation method by extending a factored-sampling technique with a diffusion process. An information-theoretic observation model is also devised to measure discriminative power of features between classes. From the viewpoint of classifier design, the proposed method naturally allows us to construct a spectrally weighted label decision rule by linearly combining the outputs from multiple classifiers. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method by analyzing the results and its success on three public databases."
22410845,"Survey and long-term clinical post-trial follow-up (interviews/correspondence) on nine chronic, post spinal cord injury (SCI) tetraplegics. To assess feasibility of the use of Electroencephalography-based Brain-Computer Interface (EEG-BCI) for reaching/grasping assistance in tetraplegics, through a robotic arm. Physical and (neuromuscular) Rehabilitation Medicine, Cardiology, Neurosurgery Clinic Divisions of TEHBA and UMPCD, in collaboration with 'Brain2Robot' (composed of the European Commission-funded Marie Curie Excellence Team by the same name, hosted by Fraunhofer Institute-FIRST), in the second part of 2008. Enrolled patients underwent EEG-BCI preliminary training and robot control sessions. Statistics entailed multiple linear regressions and cluster analysis. A follow-up-custom questionnaire based-including patients' perception of their EEG-BCI control capacity was continued up to 14 months after initial experiments. EEG-BCI performance/calibration-phase classification accuracy averaged 81.0%; feedback training sessions averaged 70.5% accuracy for 7 subjects who completed at least one feedback training session; 7 (77.7%) of 9 subjects reported having felt control of the cursor; and 3 (33.3%) subjects felt that they were also controlling the robot through their movement imagination. No significant side effects occurred. BCI performance was positively correlated with beta (13-30 Hz) EEG spectral power density (coefficient 0.432, standardized coefficient 0.745, P-value=0.025); another possible influence was sensory AIS score (range: 0 min to 224 max, coefficient -0.177, standardized coefficient -0.512, P=0.089). Limited but real potential for self-assistance in chronic tetraplegics by EEG-BCI-actuated mechatronic devices was found, which was mainly related to spectral density in the beta range positively (increasing therewith) and to AIS sensory score negatively."
22407476,"In this paper, a parallel hidden-Markov-model (PHMM)-based approach is proposed for the problem of multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns classification. The approach is based on multi-channel representation of the EEG signals using a parallel combination of HMMs, where each model represents a particular channel. The performance of the proposed algorithm is studied using an artificial EEG database, and two real EEG databases: a database of two classes of EEGs elicited during a task of imagery of hand upward and downward movements of a computer screen cursor (db Ia), and a database of two classes of sensorimotor EEGs elicited during a feedback-regulated left-right motor imagery task (db III). The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other commonly used methods with classification rate improvement of 2 and 10% for db Ia and db III, respectively. In addition, the proposed method outperforms a support vector machine classifier with a linear kernel, when both classifiers utilize the same feature set. The results also show that a model architecture which includes a left-to-right scheme with no skips, five states and three Gaussians, outperforms the other tested architectures due to the fact that it allows a better modeling of the temporal sequencing of the EEG components."
22349305,"Beta rebound is the term for bursts of EEG activity in the beta band observable after movement or somatosensory stimulation. It is assumed to reflect an active inhibition process. Our aim was to investigate the differences in the beta rebound between movement termination and withholding of movement, and the withholding of overt and covert movement. Twenty healthy persons completed Go/NoGo experiments with real and imaginary foot movements (dorsiflexion of both feet). Only participants that presented a beta rebound were considered. Event-related (de)synchronization provided the time course of the beta rebound from a participant specific frequency band. Statistical analyses revealed the significant differences between pairs of conditions: motor execution Go vs. motor execution NoGo, and motor execution NoGo vs. motor imagery NoGo. The beta rebound is stronger and lasts longer after termination of movement than during withholding of a motor response (9 participants). Withholding of overt movement generates a stronger, longer, and more widespread beta rebound than the withholding of imaginary movement (7 participants). The beta rebound is more common after termination (16/16) and withholding of real movement (12/16) than during withholding of imaginary movements (7/16). These phenomena share a common origin and a common frequency band. Their functional meaning is assumed to be the same, although there are differences in time span and intensity of the beta ERS. First direct comparison of the beta rebound between motor execution and motor withholding, as well as withholding of overt and covert foot movement. A beta rebound also occurs during withholding of a motor task, and it is more common and strong for overt movement than for covert movement."
22348825,"Either imagined or actual movements lead to a combination of electroencephalography signals with distinctive frequency, temporal and spatial characteristics, which correspond to various motor-related neural activities. This frequency-temporal-spatial pattern is the key of motor intention decoding which is the basis of brain-computer interfaces by motor imagery. We present a new method for motor-related electroencephalography recognition which comprehensively optimizes the frequency-time-space features in a user-specific way. The recognition work focuses on three points: proper time and frequency domain segmentation, spatial optimization based on common spatial pattern filters and feature importance evaluation. We show that by combining the advantages of these optimizational methods, the proposed algorithm effectively improves motor task classification, and the recognized signal chanracteristics can be used to visualize the motor related electroencephalography patterns under different conditions."
22347153,"Detecting motor imagery activities versus non-control in brain signals is the basis of self-paced brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), but also poses a considerable challenge to signal processing due to the complex and non-stationary characteristics of motor imagery as well as non-control. This paper presents a self-paced BCI based on a robust learning mechanism that extracts and selects spatio-spectral features for differentiating multiple EEG classes. It also employs a non-linear regression and post-processing technique for predicting the time-series of class labels from the spatio-spectral features. The method was validated in the BCI Competition IV on Dataset I where it produced the lowest prediction error of class labels continuously. This report also presents and discusses analysis of the method using the competition data set."
22289414,"Motor imagery is the task most commonly used to induce changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) signals for mental imagery-based brain computer interfacing (BCI). In this study, we investigated EEG patterns that were induced by seven different mental tasks (i.e. mental rotation, word association, auditory imagery, mental subtraction, spatial navigation, imagery of familiar faces and motor imagery) and evaluated the binary classification performance. The aim was to provide a broad range of reliable and user-appropriate tasks to make individual optimization of BCI control strategies possible. Nine users participated in four sessions of multi-channel EEG recordings. Mental tasks resulting most frequently in good binary classification performance include mental subtraction, word association, motor imagery and mental rotation. Our results indicate that a combination of 'brain-teasers' - tasks that require problem specific mental work (e.g. mental subtraction, word association) - and dynamic imagery tasks (e.g. motor imagery) result in highly distinguishable brain patterns that lead to an increased performance."
22287252,"Although brain-computer interface (BCI) techniques have been developing quickly in recent decades, there still exist a number of unsolved problems, such as improvement of motor imagery (MI) signal classification. In this paper, we propose a hybrid algorithm to improve the classification success rate of MI-based electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in BCIs. The proposed scheme develops a novel cross-correlation based feature extractor, which is aided with a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) for two-class MI signals recognition. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed classifier, we replace the LS-SVM classifier by a logistic regression classifier and a kernel logistic regression classifier, separately, with the same features extracted from the cross-correlation technique for the classification. The proposed approach is tested on datasets, IVa and IVb of BCI Competition III. The performances of those methods are evaluated with classification accuracy through a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. We also assess the performance of the proposed method by comparing it with eight recently reported algorithms. Experimental results on the two datasets show that the proposed LS-SVM classifier provides an improvement compared to the logistic regression and kernel logistic regression classifiers. The results also indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the most recently reported eight methods and achieves a 7.40% improvement over the best results of the other eight studies."
22275685,"In this work we investigate a nonlinear approach for feature extraction of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in order to classify motor imagery for Brain Computer Interface (BCI). This approach is based on the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and band power (BP). The EMD method is a data-driven technique to analyze non-stationary and nonlinear signals. It generates a set of stationary time series called Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) to represent the original data. These IMFs are analyzed with the power spectral density (PSD) to study the active frequency range correspond to the motor imagery for each subject. Then, the band power is computed within a certain frequency range in the channels. Finally, the data is reconstructed with only the specific IMFs and then the band power is employed on the new database. The classification of motor imagery was performed by using two classifiers, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The results obtained show that the EMD method allows the most reliable features to be extracted from EEG and that the classification rate obtained is higher and better than using only the direct BP approach."
22262524,"We propose an unsupervised recognition system for single-trial classification of motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) data in this study. Competitive Hopfield neural network (CHNN) clustering is used for the discrimination of left and right MI EEG data posterior to selecting active segment and extracting fractal features in multi-scale. First, we use continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Student's two-sample t-statistics to select the active segment in the time-frequency domain. The multiresolution fractal features are then extracted from wavelet data by means of modified fractal dimension. At last, CHNN clustering is adopted to recognize extracted features. Due to the characteristic of non-supervision, it is proper for CHNN to classify non-stationary EEG signals. The results indicate that CHNN achieves 81.9% in average classification accuracy in comparison with self-organizing map (SOM) and several popular supervised classifiers on six subjects from two data sets."
22256162,"Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems control the user's environment via his/her brain signals. Brain signals related to motor imagery (MI) have become a widespread method employed by the BCI community. Despite the large number of references describing the MI signal treatment, there is not enough information related to the available programming languages that could be suitable to develop a specific-purpose MI-based BCI. The present paper describes the development of an offline-analysis system based on MI-EEG signals via open-source programming languages, and the assessment of the system using electrical activity recorded from three subjects. The analyzer recognized at least 63% of the MI signals corresponding to three classes. The results of the offline analysis showed a promising performance considering that the subjects have never undergone MI trainings."
22256123,"This study performed an analysis of several feature extraction methods and a genetic algorithm applied to a motor imagery-based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system. Several features can be extracted from EEG signals to be used for classification in BCIs. However, it is necessary to select a small group of relevant features because the use of irrelevant features deteriorates the performance of the classifier. This study proposes a genetic algorithm (GA) as feature selection method. It was applied to the dataset IIb of the BCI Competition IV achieving a kappa coefficient of 0.613. The use of a GA improves the classification results using extracted features separately (kappa coefficient of 0.336) and the winner competition results (kappa coefficient of 0.600). These preliminary results demonstrated that the proposed methodology could be useful to control motor imagery-based BCI applications."
22256054,"We present an advanced approach towards a semi-autonomous, robotic personal assistant for handicapped people. We developed a multi-functional hybrid brain-robot interface that provides a communication channel between humans and a state-of-the-art humanoid robot, Honda's Humanoid Research Robot. Using cortical signals, recorded, processed and translated by an EEG-based brain-machine interface (BMI), human-robot interaction functions independently of users' motor control deficits. By exploiting two distinct cortical activity patterns, P300 and event-related desynchronization (ERD), the interface provides different dimensions for robot control. An empirical study demonstrated the functionality of the BMI guided humanoid robot. All participants could successfully control the robot that accomplished a shopping task."
22256027,"Stroke is a cardiovascular accident within the brain resulting in motor and sensory impairment in most of the survivors. A stroke can produce complete paralysis of the limb although sensory abilities are normally preserved. Functional electrical stimulation (FES), robotics and brain computer interfaces (BCIs) have been used to induce motor rehabilitation. In this work we measured the brain activity of healthy volunteers using electroencephalography (EEG) during FES, passive movements, active movements, motor imagery of the hand and resting to compare afferent and efferent brain signals produced during these motor related activities and to define possible features for an online FES-BCI. In the conditions in which the hand was moved we limited the movement range in order to control the afferent flow. Although we observed that there is a subject dependent frequency and spatial distribution of efferent and afferent signals, common patterns between conditions and subjects were present mainly in the low beta frequency range. When averaging all the subjects together the most significant frequency bin comparing each condition versus rest was exactly the same for all conditions but motor imagery. These results suggest that to implement an on-line FES-BCI, afferent brain signals resulting from FES have to be filtered and time-frequency-spatial features need to be used."
22255799,"We here investigated a non-linear ensemble Kalman filter (SPKF) application to a motor imagery brain computer interface (BCI). A square root central difference Kalman filter (SR-CDKF) was used as an approach for brain state estimation in motor imagery task performance, using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Healthy human subjects imagined left vs. right hand movements and tongue vs. bilateral toe movements while scalp EEG signals were recorded. Offline data analysis was conducted for training the model as well as for decoding the imagery movements. Preliminary results indicate the feasibility of this approach with a decoding accuracy of 78%-90% for the hand movements and 70%-90% for the tongue-toes movements. Ongoing research includes online BCI applications of this approach as well as combined state and parameter estimation using this algorithm with different system dynamic models."
22255789,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) uses non-muscular channel of the nervous system for communication. Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) is a popular spatial filtering method used to reduce the effect of volume conduction on EEG signals. It is thought that CSP requires a large number of electrodes to be effective. Using a 20-session dataset of motor imagery BCI usage by 5 stroke patients, we demonstrated that after channel selection, CSP can still maintain a high accuracy with low number of electrodes using a newly proposed channel selection method called CSP-rank (higher than 90% with 8 electrodes). The results showed that using only the first session for channel selection, a high accuracy can be maintained in subsequent sessions. CSP-rank has been compared to the popular support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). The results showed that the CSP-rank required less electrodes to maintain accuracy higher than 90% (a minimum of 8 compared to 12 of SVM-RFE) and it attained a higher maximum accuracy (91.7% compared with 90.7% of SVM-RFE). This could support clinicians to apply more BCI in routine rehabilitation."
22255784,"Co-adaptation between the human brain and computers is an important issue in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. However, most of the research has focused on the computer side of BCI, such as developing powerful machine-learning algorithms, while less research has focused on investigating how BCI users may optimally adapt. This paper assesses the influences of positive and negative visual feedback on motor imagery (MI) skills by evaluating the performance. More precisely, a MI based BCI paradigm was employed with fake visual feedback, regardless of subjects' real performance. Subjects were exposed to two experimental conditions--one positive and one negative, in which 80% or 30% of the trials were associated with positive feedback, respectively. The main EEG feature for MI-BCI classification--the asymmetry of mu-rhythm between hemispheres--was more prominent only after the negative feedback session. In addition, the negative feedback condition was accompanied by larger heart rate variability compared to the positive feedback condition. Our results suggest that visual feedback is an important aspect to take into account when designing BCI skill acquisition sessions."
22255776,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) may be used to control a prosthetic or orthotic hand using neural activity from the brain. The core of this sensorimotor BCI lies in the interpretation of the neural information extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG). It is desired to improve on the interpretation of EEG to allow people with neuromuscular disorders to perform daily activities. This paper investigates the possibility of discriminating between the EEG associated with wrist and finger movements. The EEG was recorded from test subjects as they executed and imagined five essential hand movements using both hands. Independent component analysis (ICA) and time-frequency techniques were used to extract spectral features based on event-related (de)synchronisation (ERD/ERS), while the Bhattacharyya distance (BD) was used for feature reduction. Mahalanobis distance (MD) clustering and artificial neural networks (ANN) were used as classifiers and obtained average accuracies of 65 % and 71 % respectively. This shows that EEG discrimination between wrist and finger movements is possible. The research introduces a new combination of motor tasks to BCI research."
22255731,"The spatial weights for electrodes called common spatial pattern (CSP) are known to be effective in EEG signal classification for motor imagery based brain computer interfaces (MI-BCI). To achieve accurate classification in CSP, the frequency filter should be properly designed. To this end, several methods for designing the filter have been proposed. However, the existing methods cannot consider plural brain activities described with different frequency bands and different spatial patterns such as activities of mu and beta rhythms. In order to efficiently extract these brain activities, we propose a method to design plural filters and spatial weights which extract desired brain activity. The proposed method designs finite impulse response (FIR) filters and the associated spatial weights by optimization of an objective function which is a natural extension of CSP. Moreover, we show by a classification experiment that the bank of FIR filters which are designed by introducing an orthogonality into the objective function can extract good discriminative features. Moreover, the experiment result suggests that the proposed method can automatically detect and extract brain activities related to motor imagery."
22255400,"This work presents a robotic wheelchair that can be commanded by a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) through Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP), Motor Imagery and Word Generation. When using SSVEP, a statistical test is used to extract the evoked response and a decision tree is used to discriminate the stimulus frequency, allowing volunteers to online operate the BCI, with hit rates varying from 60% to 100%, and guide a robotic wheelchair through an indoor environment. When using motor imagery and word generation, three mental task are used: imagination of left or right hand, and imagination of generation of words starting with the same random letter. Linear Discriminant Analysis is used to recognize the mental tasks, and the feature extraction uses Power Spectral Density. The choice of EEG channel and frequency uses the Kullback-Leibler symmetric divergence and a reclassification model is proposed to stabilize the classifier."
22255362,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct communication from the brain to devices, bypassing the traditional pathway of peripheral nerves and muscles. Traditional approaches to BCIs require the user to train for weeks or even months to learn to control the BCI. In contrast, BCIs based on machine learning only require a calibration session of less than an hour before the system can be used, since the machine adapts to the user's existing brain signals. However, this calibration session has to be repeated before each use of the BCI due to inter-session variability, which makes using a BCI still a time-consuming and an error-prone enterprise. In this work, we present a second-order baselining procedure that reduces these variations, and enables the creation of a BCI that can be applied to new subjects without such a calibration session. The method was validated with a motor-imagery classification task performed by 109 subjects. Results showed that our subject-independent BCI without calibration performs as well as the popular common spatial patterns (CSP)-based BCI that does use a calibration session."
22255269,"One of the primary challenges in noninvasive brain-computer interface (BCI) control is low information transfer rate (ITR). An approach that employs a power-based sequential hypothesis testing (SHT) technique is presented for real-time detection of motor commands. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings obtained during a BCI task were first analyzed with a hypothesis testing (HT) method. Using serial analysis we minimized the time to determine a cued motor imagery cursor control decision. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the SHT method was above 80% for all the subjects (n = 3). The average decision time was 3.4 s, as compared with 6.0 s for the HT method. Moreover, the proposed SHT method has three times the information transfer rate (ITR) compared with the HT method."
22255265,"EEG data from performing motor imagery are usually collected to calibrate a subject-specific model for classifying the EEG data during the evaluation phase of motor imagery Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). However, there is no direct objective measure to determine if a subject is performing motor imagery correctly for proper calibration. Studies have shown that passive movement, which is directly observable, induces Event-Related Synchronization patterns that are similar to those induced from motor imagery. Hence, this paper investigates the feasibility of calibrating EEG-based motor imagery BCI from passive movement. EEG data of 12 healthy subjects were collected during motor imagery and passive movement of the hand by a haptic knob robot. The calibration models using the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern algorithm on the EEG data from motor imagery were compared against using the EEG data from passive movement. The performances were compared based on the 10×10-fold cross-validation accuracies of the calibration data, and off-line session-to-session transfer kappa values to other sessions of motor imagery performed on another day. The results showed that the calibration performed using passive movement yielded higher model accuracy and off-line session-to-session transfer (73.6% and 0.354) than the calibration performed using motor imagery (71.3% and 0.311), and no significant differences were observed between the two groups (p=0.20, 0.23). Hence, this study shows that it is feasible to calibrate EEG-based motor imagery BCI from passive movement."
22255264,"Decoding human motor tasks from single trial electroencephalography (EEG) signals can help scientists better understand cortical neurophysiology and may lead to brain computer interfaces (BCI) for motor augmentation. Spatial characteristics of EEG have been used to distinguish left from right hand motor imagery and motor action. We used independent component analysis (ICA) of EEG to distinguish right knee action from right ankle action. We recorded 264-channel EEG while 5 subjects performed a variety of knee and ankle exercises. An adaptive mixture independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm generated two distinct mixture models from a merged set of EEG signals (including both knee and ankle actions) without prior knowledge of the underlying exercise. The ICA mixture models parsed EEG signals into maximally independent component (IC) processes representing electrocortical sources, muscle sources, and artifacts. We calculated a spatially fixed equivalent current dipole for each IC using an inverse modeling approach. The fit of the models to the single trial EEG signals distinguished knee exercises from ankle exercise with 90% accuracy. For 3 of 5 subjects, accuracy was 100%. Electrocortical current dipole locations revealed significant differences in the knee and ankle mixture models that were consistent with the somatotopy of the tasks. These data demonstrate that EEG mixture models can distinguish motor tasks that have different somatotopic arrangements, even within the same brain hemisphere."
22254868,"Motor imagery (MI) brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) translate a subject's motor intention to a command signal. Most MI BCIs use power features in the mu or beta rhythms, while several results have been reported using a measure of phase synchrony, the phase-locking value (PLV). In this study, we investigated the performance of various phase-based features, including instantaneous phase difference (IPD) and PLV, for control of a MI BCI. Patterns of phase synchrony differentially appear over the motor cortices and between the primary motor cortex (M1) and supplementary motor area (SMA) during MI. Offline results, along with preliminary online sessions, indicate that IPD serves as a robust control signal for differentiating between MI classes, and that the phase relations between channels are relatively stable over several months. Offline and online trial-level classification accuracies based on IPD ranged from 84% to 99%, whereas the performance for the corresponding amplitude features ranged from 70% to 100%."
22232595,"Chronic stroke patients with heterogeneous lesions, but no direct damage to the primary sensorimotor cortex, are capable of longitudinally acquiring the ability to modulate sensorimotor rhythms using grasping imagery of the affected hand. Volitional modulation of neural activity can be used to drive grasping functions of the paralyzed hand through a brain-computer interface. The neural substrates underlying this skill are not known. Here, we investigated the impact of individual patient's lesion pathology on functional and structural network integrity related to this volitional skill. Magnetoencephalography data acquired throughout training was used to derive functional networks. Structural network models and local estimates of extralesional white matter microstructure were constructed using T(1)-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data. We employed a graph theoretical approach to characterize emergent properties of distributed interactions between nodal brain regions of these networks. We report that interindividual variability in patients' lesions led to differential impairment of functional and structural network characteristics related to successful post-training sensorimotor rhythm modulation skill. Patients displaying greater magnetoencephalography global cost-efficiency, a measure of information integration within the distributed functional network, achieved greater levels of skill. Analysis of lesion damage to structural network connectivity revealed that the impact on nodal betweenness centrality of the ipsilesional primary motor cortex, a measure that characterizes the importance of a brain region for integrating visuomotor information between frontal and parietal cortical regions and related thalamic nuclei, correlated with skill. Edge betweenness centrality, an analogous measure, which assesses the role of specific white matter fibre pathways in network integration, showed a similar relationship between skill and a portion of the ipsilesional superior longitudinal fascicle connecting premotor and posterior parietal visuomotor regions known to be crucially involved in normal grasping behaviour. Finally, estimated white matter microstructure integrity in regions of the contralesional superior longitudinal fascicle adjacent to primary sensorimotor and posterior parietal cortex, as well as grey matter volume co-localized to these specific regions, positively correlated with sensorimotor rhythm modulation leading to successful brain-computer interface control. Thus, volitional modulation of ipsilesional neural activity leading to control of paralyzed hand grasping function through a brain-computer interface after longitudinal training relies on structural and functional connectivity in both ipsilesional and contralesional parietofrontal pathways involved in visuomotor information processing. Extant integrity of this structural network may serve as a future predictor of response to longitudinal therapeutic interventions geared towards training sensorimotor rhythms in the lesioned brain, secondarily improving grasping function through brain-computer interface applications."
22210463,"Patients who benefit from Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) may have difficulties to generate more than one distinct brain pattern which can be used to control applications. Other BCI issues are low performance, accuracy, and, depending on the type of BCI, a long preparation and/or training time. This study aims to show possible solutions. First, we used time-coded motor imagery (MI) with only one pattern. Second, we reduced the training time by recording only 20 trials of active MI to set up a BCI classifier. Third, we investigated a way to record error potentials (ErrPs) during continuous feedback. Ten subjects controlled an artificial arm by performing MI over target time periods between 1 and 4 s. The subsequent movement of this arm served as continuous feedback. Discrete events, which are required to elicit ErrPs, were added by mounting blinking LEDs on top of the continuously moving arm to indicate the future movements. Time epochs after these events were used to evaluate ErrPs offline. The achieved error rate for the arm movement was on average 26.9%. Obtained ErrPs looked similar to results from the previous studies dealing with error detection and the detection rate was above chance level which is a positive outcome and encourages further investigation."
22208123,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has the prospects of helping stroke survivors by enabling the interaction with their environ ment through brain signals rather than through muscles, and restoring motor function by inducing activity-dependent brain plasticity. This paper presents a clinical study on the extent of detectable brain signals from a large population of stroke patients in using EEG-based motor imagery BCI. EEG data were collected from 54 stroke patients whereby finger tapping and motor imagery of the stroke-affected hand were performed by 8 and 46 patients, respectively. EEG data from 11 patients who gave further consent to perform motor imagery were also collected for second calibration and third independent test sessions conducted on separate days. Off-line accuracies of classifying the two classes of EEG from finger tapping or motor imagery of the stroke-affected hand versus the EEG from background rest were then assessed and compared to 16 healthy subjects. The mean off-line accuracy of detecting motor imagery by the 46 patients (mu=0.74) was significantly lower than finger tapping by 8 patients (mu=0.87, p=0.008), but not significantly lower than motor imagery by healthy subjects (mu=0.78, p=0.23). Six stroke patients performed motor imagery at chance level, and no correlation was found between the accuracies of detecting motor imagery and their motor impairment in terms of Fugl-Meyer Assessment (p=0.29). The off-line accuracies of the 11 patients in the second session (mu=0.76) were not significantly different from the first session (mu=0.72, p=0.16), or from the on-line accuracies of the third independent test session (mu=0.82, p=0.14). Hence this study showed that the majority of stroke patients could use EEG-based motor imagery BCI."
22208119,"This paper presents a simple self-paced motor imagery based brain-computer interface (BCI) to control a robotic wheelchair. An innovative control protocol is proposed to enable a 2-class self-paced BCI for wheelchair control, in which the user makes path planning and fully controls the wheelchair except for the automatic obstacle avoidance based on a laser range finder when necessary. In order for the users to train their motor imagery control online safely and easily, simulated robot navigation in a specially designed environment was developed. This allowed the users to practice motor imagery control with the core self-paced BCI system in a simulated scenario before controlling the wheelchair. The self-paced BCI can then be applied to control a real robotic wheelchair using a protocol similar to that controlling the simulated robot. Our emphasis is on allowing more potential users to use the BCI controlled wheelchair with minimal training; a simple 2-class self paced system is adequate with the novel control protocol, resulting in a better transition from offline training to online control. Experimental results have demonstrated the usefulness of the online practice under the simulated scenario, and the effectiveness of the proposed self-paced BCI for robotic wheelchair control."
22108142,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) provides a new channel for communication between brain and computers through brain signals. Cost-effective EEG provides good temporal resolution, but its spatial resolution is poor and sensor information is blurred by inherent noise. To overcome these issues, spatial filtering and feature extraction techniques have been developed. Source imaging, transformation of sensor signals into the source space through source localizer, has gained attention as a new approach for BCI. It has been reported that the source imaging yields some improvement of BCI performance. However, there exists no thorough investigation on how source imaging information overlaps with, and is complementary to, sensor information. Information (visible information) from the source space may overlap as well as be exclusive to information from the sensor space is hypothesized. Therefore, we can extract more information from the sensor and source spaces if our hypothesis is true, thereby contributing to more accurate BCI systems. In this work, features from each space (sensor or source), and two strategies combining sensor and source features are assessed. The information distribution among the sensor, source, and combined spaces is discussed through a Venn diagram for 18 motor imagery datasets. Additional 5 motor imagery datasets from the BCI Competition III site were examined. The results showed that the addition of source information yielded about 3.8% classification improvement for 18 motor imagery datasets and showed an average accuracy of 75.56% for BCI Competition data. Our proposed approach is promising, and improved performance may be possible with better head model."
22046274,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow a user to interact with a computer system using thought. However, only recently have devices capable of providing sophisticated multi-dimensional control been achieved non-invasively. A major goal for non-invasive BCI systems has been to provide continuous, intuitive, and accurate control, while retaining a high level of user autonomy. By employing electroencephalography (EEG) to record and decode sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) induced from motor imaginations, a consistent, user-specific control signal may be characterized. Utilizing a novel method of interactive and continuous control, we trained three normal subjects to modulate their SMRs to achieve three-dimensional movement of a virtual helicopter that is fast, accurate, and continuous. In this system, the virtual helicopter's forward-backward translation and elevation controls were actuated through the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms that were converted to forces applied to the virtual helicopter at every simulation time step, and the helicopter's angle of left or right rotation was linearly mapped, with higher resolution, from sensorimotor rhythms associated with other motor imaginations. These different resolutions of control allow for interplay between general intent actuation and fine control as is seen in the gross and fine movements of the arm and hand. Subjects controlled the helicopter with the goal of flying through rings (targets) randomly positioned and oriented in a three-dimensional space. The subjects flew through rings continuously, acquiring as many as 11 consecutive rings within a five-minute period. In total, the study group successfully acquired over 85% of presented targets. These results affirm the effective, three-dimensional control of our motor imagery based BCI system, and suggest its potential applications in biological navigation, neuroprosthetics, and other applications."
22010143,"This paper presents a new classification framework for brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery. This framework involves the concept of Riemannian geometry in the manifold of covariance matrices. The main idea is to use spatial covariance matrices as EEG signal descriptors and to rely on Riemannian geometry to directly classify these matrices using the topology of the manifold of symmetric and positive definite (SPD) matrices. This framework allows to extract the spatial information contained in EEG signals without using spatial filtering. Two methods are proposed and compared with a reference method [multiclass Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)] on the multiclass dataset IIa from the BCI Competition IV. The first method, named minimum distance to Riemannian mean (MDRM), is an implementation of the minimum distance to mean (MDM) classification algorithm using Riemannian distance and Riemannian mean. This simple method shows comparable results with the reference method. The second method, named tangent space LDA (TSLDA), maps the covariance matrices onto the Riemannian tangent space where matrices can be vectorized and treated as Euclidean objects. Then, a variable selection procedure is applied in order to decrease dimensionality and a classification by LDA is performed. This latter method outperforms the reference method increasing the mean classification accuracy from 65.1% to 70.2%."
22007194,"Motor-imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) commonly use the common spatial pattern filter (CSP) as preprocessing step before feature extraction and classification. The CSP method is a supervised algorithm and therefore needs subject-specific training data for calibration, which is very time consuming to collect. In order to reduce the amount of calibration data that is needed for a new subject, one can apply multitask (from now on called multisubject) machine learning techniques to the preprocessing phase. Here, the goal of multisubject learning is to learn a spatial filter for a new subject based on its own data and that of other subjects. This paper outlines the details of the multitask CSP algorithm and shows results on two data sets. In certain subjects a clear improvement can be seen, especially when the number of training trials is relatively low."
22005673,"During closed-loop control of a brain-computer interface, neurons in the primary motor cortex can be intensely active even though the subject may be making no detectable movement or muscle contraction. How can neural activity in the primary motor cortex become dissociated from the movements and muscles of the native limb that it normally controls? Here we examine circumstances in which motor cortex activity is known to dissociate from movement--including mental imagery, visuo-motor dissociation and instructed delay. Many such motor cortex neurons may be related to muscle activity only indirectly. Furthermore, the integration of thousands of synaptic inputs by individual α-motoneurons means that under certain circumstances even cortico-motoneuronal cells, which make monosynaptic connections to α-motoneurons, can become dissociated from muscle activity. The natural ability of motor cortex neurons under voluntarily control to become dissociated from bodily movement may underlie the utility of this cortical area for controlling brain-computer interfaces."
21997321,"This paper presents an algorithm based on neural networks and fuzzy theory (S-dFasArt) to classify spontaneous mental activities from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, in order to operate a noninvasive brain-computer interface.

The algorithm allows a supervised classification of temporal patterns improving the classification rates of the BCI Competition III (Data Set V: multiclass problem, continuous EEG). Using the precomputed data supplied for the competition and following the rules established there, a new method based on S-dFasArt, along with rule prune and voting strategy is proposed. The results have been compared with other published methods improving their success rates."
21992570,"The subjects in EEG-Brain computer interface (BCI) system experience difficulties when attempting to obtain the consistent performance of the actual movement by motor imagery alone. It is necessary to find the optimal conditions and stimuli combinations that affect the performance factors of the EEG-BCI system to guarantee equipment safety and trust through the performance evaluation of using motor imagery characteristics that can be utilized in the EEG-BCI testing environment. The experiment was carried out with 10 experienced subjects and 32 naive subjects on an EEG-BCI system. There were 3 experiments: The experienced homogeneous experiment, the naive homogeneous experiment and the naive heterogeneous experiment. Each experiment was compared in terms of the six audio-visual cue combinations and consisted of 50 trials. The EEG data was classified using the least square linear classifier in case of the naive subjects through the common spatial pattern filter. The accuracy was calculated using the training and test data set. The p-value of the accuracy was obtained through the statistical significance test. In the case in which a naive subject was trained by a heterogeneous combined cue and tested by a visual cue, the result was not only the highest accuracy (p < 0.05) but also stable performance in all experiments. We propose the use of this measuring methodology of a heterogeneous combined cue for training data and a visual cue for test data by the typical EEG-BCI algorithm on the EEG-BCI system to achieve effectiveness in terms of consistence, stability, cost, time, and resources management without the need for a trial and error process."
21984522,"Intermuscular coherence can identify oscillatory coupling between two electromyographic (EMG) signals, measuring common presynaptic drive to motor neurons. Beta band oscillations (15-30 Hz) are hypothesized to originate largely from primary motor cortex, and are reduced during dynamic relative to static motor tasks. It has yet to be established whether motor imagery modulates beta intermuscular coherence. Using visual feedback, 10 unimpaired participants completed eighteen trials of pinching their right thumb and index finger at a constant force. During the 60-second trials, participants simultaneously engaged in one of three types of kinesthetic imagery: the right thumb and index finger executing a constant force pinch (static), the fingers of the right hand sequentially flexing and extending (dynamic), and the right foot pushing down with constant force (foot). Motor imagery of a dynamic motor task resulted in significantly lower intermuscular beta coherence than imagery of a static motor pinch task, without any difference in task performance or root-mean-square EMG. Thus, motor imagery affects intermuscular coherence in the beta band, even while measures of task performance remain constant. This finding provides insight for incorporation of beta band intermuscular coherence in future motor rehabilitation schemes and brain computer interface design."
21984520,"The brain-computer interface (BCI) system has been developed to assist people with motor disability. To make the system more user-friendly, it is a challenge to reduce the electrode preparation time and have a good reliability. This study aims to find a minimal set of electrodes for an individual stroke subject for motor imagery to control an assistive device using functional electrical stimulation for 20 sessions with accuracy higher than 90%. The characteristics of this minimal electrode set were evaluated with two popular algorithms: Fisher's criterion and support-vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). The number of calibration sessions for channel selection required for robust control of these 20 sessions was also investigated. Five chronic stroke patients were recruited for the study. Our results suggested that the number of calibration sessions for channel selection did not have a significant effect on the classification accuracy. A performance index devised in this study showed that one training day with 12 electrodes using the SVM-RFE method achieved the best balance between the number of electrodes and accuracy in the 20-session data. Generally, 8-36 channels were required to maintain accuracy higher than 90% in 20 BCI training sessions for chronic stroke patients."
21984519,"Event-related desynchronization (ERD) of sensori-motor rhythms (SMR) can be used for online brain-machine interface (BMI) control, but yields challenges related to the stability of ERD and feedback strategy to optimize BMI learning.Here, we compared two approaches to this challenge in 20 right-handed healthy subjects (HS, five sessions each, S1-S5) and four stroke patients (SP, 15 sessions each, S1-S15). ERD was recorded from a 275-sensor MEG system. During daily training,motor imagery-induced ERD led to visual and proprioceptive feedback delivered through an orthotic device attached to the subjects' hand and fingers. Group A trained with a heterogeneous reference value (RV) for ERD detection with binary feedback and Group B with a homogenous RV and graded feedback (10 HS and 2 SP in each group). HS in Group B showed better BMI performance than Group A (p < 0.001) and improved BMI control from S1 to S5 (p = 0.012) while Group A did not. In spite of the small n, SP in Group B showed a trend for a higher BMI performance (p = 0.06) and learning was significantly better (p < 0.05). Using a homogeneous RV and graded feedback led to improved modulation of ipsilesional activity resulting in superior BMI learning relative to use of a heterogeneous RV and binary feedback."
21964375,"After about 30 years of research on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) there is little knowledge about the phenomenon, that some people - healthy as well as individuals with disease - are not able to learn BCI-control. To elucidate this ""BCI-inefficiency"" phenomenon, the current study investigated whether psychological parameters, such as attention span, personality or motivation, could predict performance in a single session with a BCI controlled by modulation of sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) with motor imagery. A total of N=83 healthy BCI novices took part in the session. Psychological parameters were measured with an electronic test-battery including clinical, personality and performance tests. Predictors were determined by binary logistic regression analyses. The output variable of the Two-Hand Coordination Test (2HAND) ""overall mean error duration"" which is a measure for the accuracy of fine motor skills accounted for 11% of the variance in BCI-inefficiency. The Attitudes Towards Work (AHA) test variable ""performance level"" which can be interpreted as a degree of concentration and a neurophysiological SMR predictor were also identified as significant predictors of SMR BCI performance. Psychological parameters as measured in this study play a moderate role for one-session performance in a BCI controlled by modulation of SMR."
21947797,"Selecting suitable feature types is crucial to obtain good overall brain-computer interface performance. Popular feature types include logarithmic band power (logBP), autoregressive (AR) parameters, time-domain parameters, and wavelet-based methods. In this study, we focused on different variants of AR models and compare performance with logBP features. In particular, we analyzed univariate, vector, and bilinear AR models. We used four-class motor imagery data from nine healthy users over two sessions. We used the first session to optimize parameters such as model order and frequency bands. We then evaluated optimized feature extraction methods on the unseen second session. We found that band power yields significantly higher classification accuracies than AR methods. However, we did not update the bias of the classifiers for the second session in our analysis procedure. When updating the bias at the beginning of a new session, we found no significant differences between all methods anymore. Furthermore, our results indicate that subject-specific optimization is not better than globally optimized parameters. The comparison within the AR methods showed that the vector model is significantly better than both univariate and bilinear variants. Finally, adding the prediction error variance to the feature space significantly improved classification results."
21947184,"To explore the effectiveness of neurorehabilitative training using an electroencephalogram-based brain- computer interface for hand paralysis following stroke. A case series study. Eight outpatients with chronic stroke demonstrating moderate to severe hemiparesis. Based on analysis of volitionally decreased amplitudes of sensory motor rhythm during motor imagery involving extending the affected fingers, real-time visual feedback was provided. After successful motor imagery, a mechanical orthosis partially extended the fingers. Brain-computer interface interventions were carried out once or twice a week for a period of 4-7 months, and clinical and neurophysiological examinations pre- and post-intervention were compared. New voluntary electromyographic activity was measured in the affected finger extensors in 4 cases who had little or no muscle activity before the training, and the other participants exhibited improvement in finger function. Significantly greater suppression of the sensory motor rhythm over both hemispheres was observed during motor imagery. Transcranial magnetic stimulation showed increased cortical excitability in the damaged hemisphere. Success rates of brain-computer interface training tended to increase as the session progressed in 4 cases. Brain-computer interface training appears to have yielded some improvement in motor function and brain plasticity. Further controlled research is needed to clarify the role of the brain-computer interface system."
21926016,"To control a cursor on a monitor screen, a user generally needs to perform two tasks sequentially. The first task is to move the cursor to a target on the monitor screen (termed a 2-D cursor movement), and the second task is either to select a target of interest by clicking on it or to reject a target that is not of interest by not clicking on it. In a previous study, we implemented the former function in an EEG-based brain-computer interface system using motor imagery and the P300 potential to control the horizontal and vertical cursor movements, respectively. In this study, the target selection or rejection functionality is implemented using a hybrid feature from motor imagery and the P300 potential. Specifically, to select the target of interest, the user must focus his or her attention on a flashing button to evoke the P300 potential, while simultaneously maintaining an idle state of motor imagery. Otherwise, the user performs left-/right-hand motor imagery without paying attention to any buttons to reject the target. Our data analysis and online experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed hybrid feature is shown to be more effective than the use of either the motor imagery feature or the P300 feature alone. Eleven subjects attended our online experiment, in which a trial involved sequential 2-D cursor movement and target selection. The average duration of each trial and average accuracy of target selection were 18.19 s and 93.99% , respectively, and each target selection or rejection event was performed within 2 s."
21911058,"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have become a large research field that include challenges mainly in neuroscience, signal processing, machine learning and user interface. A non-invasive BCI can allow the direct communication between humans and computers by analyzing electrical brain activity, recorded at the surface of the scalp with electroencephalography. The main purpose for BCIs is to enable communication for people with severe disabilities. Spelling is one of the first BCI application, it corresponds to the main communication mean for people who are unable to speak. While spelling can be the most basic application it remains a benchmark for communication applications and one challenge in the BCI community for some patients. This paper proposes a review of the current main strategies, and their limitations, for spelling words. It includes recent BCIs based on P300, steady-state visual evoked potentials and motor imagery. By considering some challenges in BCI spellers and virtual keyboards, some pragmatic issues are pointed out to eliminate false hopes about BCI for both disabled and healthy people."
21886674,"In the motor imagery based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) research, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm is used widely as a spatial filter on multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Recently the overfitting effect of CSP has been gradually noticed, but what influence the overfitting is still unclear. In this work, the generalization of CSP is investigated by a simple linear mixing model. Several factors in this model are discussed, and the simulation results indicate that channel numbers and the correlation between signals influence the generalization of CSP significantly. A larger number of training trials and a longer time length of the trial would prevent overfitting. The experiments on real data also verify our conclusion."
21886673,"Parameter setting plays an important role for improving the performance of a brain computer interface (BCI). Currently, parameters (e.g. channels and frequency band) are often manually selected. It is time-consuming and not easy to obtain an optimal combination of parameters for a BCI. In this paper, motor imagery-based BCIs are considered, in which channels and frequency band are key parameters. First, a semi-supervised support vector machine algorithm is proposed for automatically selecting a set of channels with given frequency band. Next, this algorithm is extended for joint channel-frequency selection. In this approach, both training data with labels and test data without labels are used for training a classifier. Hence it can be used in small training data case. Finally, our algorithms are applied to a BCI competition data set. Our data analysis results show that these algorithms are effective for selection of frequency band and channels when the training data set is small."
21840399,"Noninvasive Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) have been promoted to be used for neuroprosthetics. However, reports on applications with electroencephalography (EEG) show a demand for a better accuracy and stability. Here we investigate whether near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be used to enhance the EEG approach. In our study both methods were applied simultaneously in a real-time Sensory Motor Rhythm (SMR)-based BCI paradigm, involving executed movements as well as motor imagery. We tested how the classification of NIRS data can complement ongoing real-time EEG classification. Our results show that simultaneous measurements of NIRS and EEG can significantly improve the classification accuracy of motor imagery in over 90% of considered subjects and increases performance by 5% on average (p<0:01). However, the long time delay of the hemodynamic response may hinder an overall increase of bit-rates. Furthermore we find that EEG and NIRS complement each other in terms of information content and are thus a viable multimodal imaging technique, suitable for BCI."
21810266,"Artifacts contained in EEG recordings hamper both, the visual interpretation by experts as well as the algorithmic processing and analysis (e.g. for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) or for Mental State Monitoring). While hand-optimized selection of source components derived from Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to clean EEG data is widespread, the field could greatly profit from automated solutions based on Machine Learning methods. Existing ICA-based removal strategies depend on explicit recordings of an individual's artifacts or have not been shown to reliably identify muscle artifacts. We propose an automatic method for the classification of general artifactual source components. They are estimated by TDSEP, an ICA method that takes temporal correlations into account. The linear classifier is based on an optimized feature subset determined by a Linear Programming Machine (LPM). The subset is composed of features from the frequency-, the spatial- and temporal domain. A subject independent classifier was trained on 640 TDSEP components (reaction time (RT) study, n = 12) that were hand labeled by experts as artifactual or brain sources and tested on 1080 new components of RT data of the same study. Generalization was tested on new data from two studies (auditory Event Related Potential (ERP) paradigm, n = 18; motor imagery BCI paradigm, n = 80) that used data with different channel setups and from new subjects. Based on six features only, the optimized linear classifier performed on level with the inter-expert disagreement (<10% Mean Squared Error (MSE)) on the RT data. On data of the auditory ERP study, the same pre-calculated classifier generalized well and achieved 15% MSE. On data of the motor imagery paradigm, we demonstrate that the discriminant information used for BCI is preserved when removing up to 60% of the most artifactual source components. We propose a universal and efficient classifier of ICA components for the subject independent removal of artifacts from EEG data. Based on linear methods, it is applicable for different electrode placements and supports the introspection of results. Trained on expert ratings of large data sets, it is not restricted to the detection of eye- and muscle artifacts. Its performance and generalization ability is demonstrated on data of different EEG studies."
21803163,"Advances in fMRI data acquisition and processing have made it possible to analyze brain activity as rapidly as the images are acquired allowing this information to be fed back to subjects in the scanner. The ability of subjects to learn to volitionally control localized brain activity within motor cortex using such real-time fMRI-based neurofeedback (NF) is actively being investigated as it may have clinical implications for motor rehabilitation after central nervous system injury and brain-computer interfaces. We investigated the ability of fifteen healthy volunteers to use NF to modulate brain activity within the primary motor cortex (M1) during a finger tapping and tapping imagery task. The M1 hand area ROI (ROI(m)) was functionally localized during finger tapping and a visual representation of BOLD signal changes within the ROI(m) fed back to the subject in the scanner. Surface EMG was used to assess motor output during tapping and ensure no motor activity was present during motor imagery task. Subjects quickly learned to modulate brain activity within their ROI(m) during the finger-tapping task, which could be dissociated from the magnitude of the tapping, but did not show a significant increase within the ROI(m) during the hand motor imagery task at the group level despite strongly activating a network consistent with the performance of motor imagery. The inability of subjects to modulate M1 proper with motor imagery may reflect an inherent difficulty in activating synapses in this area, with or without NF, since such activation may lead to M1 neuronal output and obligatory muscle activity. Future real-time fMRI-based NF investigations involving motor cortex may benefit from focusing attention on cortical regions other than M1 for feedback training or alternative feedback strategies such as measures of functional connectivity within the motor system."
21779234,"A new approach in motor rehabilitation after stroke is to use motor imagery (MI). To give feedback on MI performance brain-computer interface (BCIs) can be used. This requires a fast and easy acquisition of a reliable classifier. Usually, for training a classifier, electroencephalogram (EEG) data of MI without feedback is used, but it would be advantageous if we could give feedback right from the beginning. The sensorimotor EEG changes of the motor cortex during active and passive movement (PM) and MI are similar. The aim of this study is to explore, whether it is possible to use EEG data from active or PM to set up a classifier for the detection of MI in a group of elderly persons. In addition, the activation patterns of the motor cortical areas of elderly persons were analyzed during different motor tasks. EEG was recorded from three Laplacian channels over the sensorimotor cortex in a sample of 19 healthy elderly volunteers. Participants performed three different tasks in consecutive order, passive, active hand movement, and hand MI. Classifiers were calculated with data of every task. These classifiers were then used to detect event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the MI data. ERD values, related to the different tasks, were calculated and analyzed statistically. The performance of classifiers calculated from passive and active hand movement data did not differ significantly regarding the classification accuracy for detecting MI. The EEG patterns of the motor cortical areas during the different tasks was similar to the patterns normally found in younger persons but more widespread regarding localization and frequency range of the ERD. In this study, we have shown that it is possible to use classifiers calculated with data from passive and active hand movement to detect MI. Hence, for working with stroke patients, a physiotherapy session could be used to obtain data for classifier set up and the BCI-rehabilitation training could start immediately."
21772075,"Inherent changes that appear in brain signals when transferring from calibration to feedback sessions are a challenging but critical issue in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. While previous studies have mostly focused on the adaptation of classifiers, in this paper we study the feasibility and the importance of the adaptation of feature extraction in a self-paced BCI paradigm. First, we conduct calibration and feedback training on able-bodied naïve subjects using a new self-paced motor imagery BCI including the idle state. The online results suggest that the feature space constructed from calibration data may become ineffective during feedback sessions. Hence, we propose a new supervised method that learns from a feedback session to construct a more appropriate feature space, on the basis of the maximum mutual information principle between feedback signal, target signal and EEG. Specifically, we formulate the learning objective as maximizing a kernel-based mutual information estimate with respect to the spatial-spectral filtering parameters. We then derive a gradient-based optimization algorithm for the learning task. An experimental study is conducted using offline simulation. The results show that the proposed method is able to construct effective feature spaces to capture the discriminative information in feedback training data and, consequently, the prediction error can be significantly reduced using the new features."
21683346,"In this study, an adaptive electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis system is proposed for a two-session, single-trial classification of motor imagery (MI) data. Applying event-related brain potential (ERP) data acquired from the sensorimotor cortices, the adaptive linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used for classification of left- and right-hand MI data and for simultaneous and continuous update of its parameters. In addition to the original use of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Student's two-sample t-statistics, the 2D anisotropic Gaussian filter is proposed to further refine the selection of active segments. The multiresolution fractal features are then extracted from wavelet data by means of modified fractal dimension. The classification in session 2 is performed by adaptive LDA, which is trial-by-trial updated using the Kalman filter after the trial is classified. Compared with original active segment selection and non-adaptive LDA on six subjects from two data sets, the results indicate that the proposed method is helpful to realize adaptive BCI systems."
21682906,"For brain computer interfaces (BCIs), which may be valuable in neurorehabilitation, brain signals derived from mental activation can be monitored by non-invasive methods, such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Single-trial classification is important for this purpose and this was the aim of the presented study. In particular, we aimed to investigate a combined approach: 1) offline single-trial classification of brain signals derived from a novel wireless fNIRS instrument; 2) to use motor imagery (MI) as mental task thereby discriminating between MI signals in response to different tasks complexities, i.e. simple and complex MI tasks. 12 subjects were asked to imagine either a simple finger-tapping task using their right thumb or a complex sequential finger-tapping task using all fingers of their right hand. fNIRS was recorded over secondary motor areas of the contralateral hemisphere. Using Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) and cross validation, we selected for each subject a best-performing feature combination consisting of 1) one out of three channel, 2) an analysis time interval ranging from 5-15 s after stimulation onset and 3) up to four Δ[O2Hb] signal features (Δ[O2Hb] mean signal amplitudes, variance, skewness and kurtosis). The results of our single-trial classification showed that using the simple combination set of channels, time intervals and up to four Δ[O2Hb] signal features comprising Δ[O2Hb] mean signal amplitudes, variance, skewness and kurtosis, it was possible to discriminate single-trials of MI tasks differing in complexity, i.e. simple versus complex tasks (inter-task paired t-test p ≤ 0.001), over secondary motor areas with an average classification accuracy of 81%. Although the classification accuracies look promising they are nevertheless subject of considerable subject-to-subject variability. In the discussion we address each of these aspects, their limitations for future approaches in single-trial classification and their relevance for neurorehabilitation."
21511526,"Mental imagery-based brain-computer interface (BCI)-protocols mostly allow users to focus on the task without external interferences. Environmental stimuli, however, may hamper users' ability to generate proper brain activity patterns. The aim of this study was to investigate whether users are able to retain satisfactory BCI control during auditory distraction, and whether distinct mental tasks are affected differently from auditory distraction. Twelve participants controlled a 4-class BCI with the mental tasks word association, mental subtraction, spatial navigation and motor imagery by modulation of EEG frequency bands in 10 sessions. Simultaneously to the imagery task, users had to either ignore all tones (passive distraction) that were presented according to an oddball paradigm or react upon the target tone (active distraction). Passive distraction led to an increased user performance compared to active distraction and no distraction condition. Differences between motor imagery and the other three mental tasks in performance were reflected in the P300 amplitude, latency and reaction time and thus might indicate differences in workload. Auditory distraction had no adverse effect on the BCI performance of the examined mental task. Our results are encouraging for real-world application as participants succeeded in operating the 4-class BCI during auditory distraction."
21478575,"In an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI), motor imagery has been successfully used as a communication strategy. Motor imagery causes detectable amplitude changes in certain frequency bands of EEGs, which are dubbed event-related desynchronization\synchronization. The frequency components that give effective discrimination between different types of motor imagery are subject specific and identification of these subject-specific discriminative frequency components (DFCs) is important for the accurate classification of motor imagery activities. In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate the DFC using the Fisher criterion and investigate the variability of these DFCs over multiple sessions of EEG recording. Observing the variability of DFC over sessions in the analysis, a new BCI approach called the Adaptively Weighted Spectral-Spatial Patterns (AWSSP) algorithm is proposed. AWSSP tracks the variation in DFC over time adaptively based on the deviation of discriminative weight values of frequency components. The classification performance of the proposed AWSSP is compared with a static BCI approach that employs fixed DFCs. In the offline and online experiments, AWSSP offers better classification performance than the static approach, emphasizing the significance of tracking the variability of DFCs in EEGs for developing robust motor imagery-based BCI systems. A study of the effect of feedback on the variation in DFCs is also performed in online experiments and it is found that the presence of visual feedback results in increased variation in DFCs."
21474878,"The combination of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) with robot-assisted physical therapy constitutes a promising approach to neurorehabilitation of patients with severe hemiparetic syndromes caused by cerebrovascular brain damage (e.g. stroke) and other neurological conditions. In such a scenario, a key aspect is how to reestablish the disrupted sensorimotor feedback loop. However, to date it is an open question how artificially closing the sensorimotor feedback loop influences the decoding performance of a BCI. In this paper, we answer this issue by studying six healthy subjects and two stroke patients. We present empirical evidence that haptic feedback, provided by a seven degrees of freedom robotic arm, facilitates online decoding of arm movement intention. The results support the feasibility of future rehabilitative treatments based on the combination of robot-assisted physical therapy with BCIs."
21436535,"For the development of minimally invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), it is important to accurately localize the area of implantation. Using fMRI, we investigated which brain areas are involved in motor imagery. Twelve healthy subjects performed a motor execution and imagery task during separate fMRI and EEG measurements. fMRI results showed that during imagery, premotor and parietal areas were most robustly activated in individual subjects, but surprisingly, no activation was found in the primary motor cortex. EEG results showed that spectral power decreases in contralateral sensorimotor rhythms (8-24 Hz) during both movement and imagery. To further verify the involvement of the motor imagery areas found with fMRI, one epilepsy patient performed the same task during both fMRI and ECoG recordings. Significant ECoG low (8-24 Hz) and high (65-95 Hz) frequency power changes were observed selectively on premotor cortex and these co-localized with fMRI. During a subsequent BCI task, excellent performance (91%) was obtained based on ECoG power changes from the localized premotor area. These results indicate that other areas than the primary motor area may be more reliably activated during motor imagery. Specifically, the premotor cortex may be a better area to implant an invasive BCI."
21436530,"The extraction of distinctly separable features from electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the main challenges in designing a brain-computer interface (BCI). Existing feature extraction techniques for a BCI are mostly developed based on traditional signal processing techniques assuming that the signal is Gaussian and has linear characteristics. But the motor imagery (MI)-related EEG signals are highly non-Gaussian, non-stationary and have nonlinear dynamic characteristics. This paper proposes an advanced, robust but simple feature extraction technique for a MI-related BCI. The technique uses one of the higher order statistics methods, the bispectrum, and extracts the features of nonlinear interactions over several frequency components in MI-related EEG signals. Along with a linear discriminant analysis classifier, the proposed technique has been used to design an MI-based BCI. Three performance measures, classification accuracy, mutual information and Cohen's kappa have been evaluated and compared with a BCI using a contemporary power spectral density-based feature extraction technique. It is observed that the proposed technique extracts nearly recording-session-independent distinct features resulting in significantly much higher and consistent MI task detection accuracy and Cohen's kappa. It is therefore concluded that the bispectrum-based feature extraction is a promising technique for detecting different brain states."
21436518,"Conditional random fields (CRFs) are demonstrated to be a discriminative model able to exploit the temporal properties of EEG data obtained during synchronous three-class motor-imagery-based brain-computer interface experiments. The advantages of CRFs over the hidden Markov model (HMM) are both theoretical and practical. Theoretically, CRFs focus on modeling latent variables (labels) rather than both observation and latent variables. Furthermore, CRFs' loss function is convex, guaranteeing convergence to the global optimum. Practically, CRFs are much less prone to singularity problems. This property allows for the use of both time- and frequency-based features, such as band power. The HMM, on the other hand, requires temporal features such as autoregressive coefficients. A CRF-based classifier is tested on 13 subjects. Significant improvement is found when applying CRFs over HMM- and LDA-based classifiers."
21436515,"All brain-computer interface (BCI) groups that have published results of studies involving a large number of users performing BCI control based on the voluntary modulation of sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) report that BCI control could not be achieved by a non-negligible number of subjects (estimated 20% to 25%). This failure of the BCI system to read the intention of the user is one of the greatest problems and challenges in BCI research. There are two main causes for this problem in SMR-based BCI systems: either no idle SMR is observed over motor areas of the user, or this idle rhythm is not modulated during motor imagery, resulting in a classification performance lower than 70% (criterion level) that renders the control of a BCI application (like a speller) difficult or impossible. Previously, we introduced the concept of machine learning based co-adaptive calibration, which provided substantially improved performance for a variety of users. Here, we use a similar approach and investigate to what extent co-adaptive learning enables significant BCI control for completely novice users, as well as for those who could not achieve control with a conventional SMR-based BCI."
21436514,"The main purpose of electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) technology is to provide an alternative channel to support communication and control when motor pathways are interrupted. Despite the considerable amount of research focused on the improvement of EEG signal detection and translation into output commands, little is known about how learning to operate a BCI device may affect brain plasticity. This study investigated if and how sensorimotor rhythm-based BCI training would induce persistent functional changes in motor cortex, as assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and high-density EEG. Motor imagery (MI)-based BCI training in naïve participants led to a significant increase in motor cortical excitability, as revealed by post-training TMS mapping of the hand muscle's cortical representation; peak amplitude and volume of the motor evoked potentials recorded from the opponens pollicis muscle were significantly higher only in those subjects who develop a MI strategy based on imagination of hand grasping to successfully control a computer cursor. Furthermore, analysis of the functional brain networks constructed using a connectivity matrix between scalp electrodes revealed a significant decrease in the global efficiency index for the higher-beta frequency range (22-29 Hz), indicating that the brain network changes its topology with practice of hand grasping MI. Our findings build the neurophysiological basis for the use of non-invasive BCI technology for monitoring and guidance of motor imagery-dependent brain plasticity and thus may render BCI a viable tool for post-stroke rehabilitation."
21431597,A brain machine interface (BMI) design for controlling the navigation of a power wheelchair is proposed. Real-time experiments with four able bodied subjects are carried out using the BMI-controlled wheelchair. The BMI is based on only two electrodes and operated by motor imagery of four states. A recurrent neural classifier is proposed for the classification of the four mental states. The real-time experiment results of four subjects are reported and problems emerging from asynchronous control are discussed.
21427014,"Multichannel EEG is generally used in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), whereby performing EEG channel selection 1) improves BCI performance by removing irrelevant or noisy channels and 2) enhances user convenience from the use of lesser channels. This paper proposes a novel sparse common spatial pattern (SCSP) algorithm for EEG channel selection. The proposed SCSP algorithm is formulated as an optimization problem to select the least number of channels within a constraint of classification accuracy. As such, the proposed approach can be customized to yield the best classification accuracy by removing the noisy and irrelevant channels, or retain the least number of channels without compromising the classification accuracy obtained by using all the channels. The proposed SCSP algorithm is evaluated using two motor imagery datasets, one with a moderate number of channels and another with a large number of channels. In both datasets, the proposed SCSP channel selection significantly reduced the number of channels, and outperformed existing channel selection methods based on Fisher criterion, mutual information, support vector machine, common spatial pattern, and regularized common spatial pattern in classification accuracy. The proposed SCSP algorithm also yielded an average improvement of 10% in classification accuracy compared to the use of three channels (C3, C4, and Cz)."
21394652,"A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a device that transforms brain signals, which are intentionally modulated by a user, into control commands. BCIs based on motor imagery (MI) and steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) can partially restore motor control in spinal cord injured patients. To determine whether these BCIs can be combined for grasp and elbow function control independently, we investigated a control method where the beta rebound after brisk feet MI is used to control the grasp function, and a two-class SSVEP-BCI the elbow function of a 2 degrees-of-freedom artificial upper limb. Subjective preferences for the BCI control were assessed with a questionnaire. The results of the initial evaluation of the system suggests that this is feasible."
21374997,"This research was aimed at the feature extraction problem in brain computer interface (BCI). The combination algorithm based on independent component analysis (ICA) and common spatial pattern (CSP) was introduced into this work for exploring frequency domain characteristics from Electroencephalography (EEG). Firstly, a pre-processing step with ICA was applied to remove artifacts, and EEG was filtered through an 8-30 Hz bandpass filter. Secondly, EEG was decomposed into spatial patterns with CSP, which were extracted from two most discriminative populations, and event related desynchronization (ERD)/event related synchronization (ERS) characteristic was extracted with power spectrum analysis. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) was used to classify motor imagery tasks, and good results were obtained. For validation, the motor imagery EEG data provided by BCI Competition 2008-Graz data set B were used, and the results showed that the combination algorithm enhanced the signal-to-noise ratio and extracted discriminative characteristics. It was an effective method for classification recognition."
21353631,"An auditory rhythm can be perceived as a sequence of accented (loud) and non-accented (soft) beats or it can be imagined. Subjective rhythmization refers to the induction of accenting patterns during the presentation of identical auditory pulses at an isochronous rate. It can be an automatic process, but it can also be voluntarily controlled. We investigated whether imagined accents can be decoded from brain signals on a single-trial basis, and if there is information shared between perception and imagery in the contrast of accents and non-accents. Ten subjects perceived and imagined three different metric patterns (two-, three-, and four-beat) superimposed on a steady metronome while electroencephalography (EEG) measurements were made. Shared information between perception and imagery EEG is investigated by means of principal component analysis and by means of single-trial classification. Classification of accented from non-accented beats was possible with an average accuracy of 70% for perception and 61% for imagery data. Cross-condition classification yielded significant performance above chance level for a classifier trained on perception and tested on imagery data (up to 66%), and vice versa (up to 60%). Results show that detection of imagined accents is possible and reveal similarity in brain signatures relevant to distinction of accents from non-accents in perception and imagery. Our results support the idea of shared mechanisms in perception and imagery for auditory processing. This is relevant for a number of clinical settings, most notably by elucidating the basic mechanisms of rhythmic auditory cuing paradigms, e.g. as used in motor rehabilitation or therapy for Parkinson's disease. As a novel Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) paradigm, our results imply a reduction of the necessary BCI training in healthy subjects and in patients."
21297944,"There is a growing interest in the study of signal processing and machine learning methods, which may make the brain computer interface (BCI) a new communication channel. A variety of classification methods have been utilized to convert the brain information into control commands. However, most of the methods only produce uncalibrated values and uncertain results. In this study, we presented a probabilistic method ""enhanced BLDA"" (EBLDA) for multi-class motor imagery BCI, which utilized Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) with probabilistic output to improve the classification performance. EBLDA builds a new classifier that enlarges training dataset by adding test samples with high probability. EBLDA is based on the hypothesis that unlabeled samples with high probability provide valuable information to enhance learning process and generate a classifier with refined decision boundaries. To investigate the performance of EBLDA, we first used carefully designed simulated datasets to study how EBLDA works. Then, we adopted a real BCI dataset for further evaluation. The current study shows that: 1) Probabilistic information can improve the performance of BCI for subjects with high kappa coefficient; 2) With supplementary training samples from the test samples of high probability, EBLDA is significantly better than BLDA in classification, especially for small training datasets, in which EBLDA can obtain a refined decision boundary by a shift of BLDA decision boundary with the support of the information from test samples. The proposed EBLDA could potentially reduce training effort. Therefore, it is valuable for us to realize an effective online BCI system, especially for multi-class BCI systems."
21276859,"Decoding experimental conditions from single trial Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is becoming a major challenge for the study of brain function and real-time applications such as Brain Computer Interface. EEG source reconstruction offers principled ways to estimate the cortical activities from EEG signals. But to what extent it can enhance informative brain signals in single trial has not been addressed in a general setting. We tested this using the minimum norm estimate solution (MNE) to estimate spectral power and coherence features at the cortical level. With a fast implementation, we computed a support vector machine (SVM) classifier output from these quantities in real-time, without prior on the relevant functional networks. We applied this approach to single trial decoding of ongoing mental imagery tasks using EEG data recorded in 5 subjects. Our results show that reconstructing the underlying cortical network dynamics significantly outperforms a usual electrode level approach in terms of information transfer and also reduces redundancy between coherence and power features, supporting a decrease of volume conduction effects. Additionally, the classifier coefficients reflect the most informative features of network activity, showing an important contribution of localized motor and sensory brain areas, and of coherence between areas up to 6cm distance. This study provides a computationally efficient and interpretable strategy to extract information from functional networks at the cortical level in single trial. Moreover, this sets a general framework to evaluate the performance of EEG source reconstruction methods by their decoding abilities."
21267657,"A first step in designing a robust and optimal model-based predictive controller (MPC) for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications is presented in this article. An MPC has the potential to achieve improved BCI performance compared to the performance achieved by current ad hoc, nonmodel-based filter applications. The parameters in designing the controller were extracted as model-based features from motor imagery task-related human scalp electroencephalography. Although the parameters can be generated from any model-linear or non-linear, we here adopted a simple autoregressive model that has well-established applications in BCI task discriminations. It was shown that the parameters generated for the controller design can as well be used for motor imagery task discriminations with performance (with 8-23% task discrimination errors) comparable to the discrimination performance of the commonly used features such as frequency specific band powers and the AR model parameters directly used. An optimal MPC has significant implications for high performance BCI applications."
21256234,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable people with paralysis to communicate with their environment. Motor imagery can be used to generate distinct patterns of cortical activation in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and thus control a BCI. To elucidate the cortical correlates of BCI control, users of a sensory motor rhythm (SMR)-BCI were classified according to their BCI control performance. In a second session these participants performed a motor imagery, motor observation and motor execution task in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. Group difference analysis between high and low aptitude BCI users revealed significantly higher activation of the supplementary motor areas (SMA) for the motor imagery and the motor observation tasks in high aptitude users. Low aptitude users showed no activation when observing movement. The number of activated voxels during motor observation was significantly correlated with accuracy in the EEG-BCI task (r=0.53). Furthermore, the number of activated voxels in the right middle frontal gyrus, an area responsible for processing of movement observation, correlated (r=0.72) with BCI-performance. This strong correlation highlights the importance of these areas for task monitoring and working memory as task goals have to be activated throughout the BCI session. The ability to regulate behavior and the brain through learning mechanisms involving imagery such as required to control a BCI constitutes the consequence of ideo-motor co-activation of motor brain systems during observation of movements. The results demonstrate that acquisition of a sensorimotor program reflected in SMR-BCI-control is tightly related to the recall of such sensorimotor programs during observation of movements and unrelated to the actual execution of these movement sequences."
21216696,"This paper proposes a feature extraction method for motor imagery brain-computer interface (BCI) using electroencephalogram. We consider the primary neurophysiologic phenomenon of motor imagery, termed event-related desynchronization, and formulate the learning task for feature extraction as maximizing the mutual information between the spatio-spectral filtering parameters and the class labels. After introducing a nonparametric estimate of mutual information, a gradient-based learning algorithm is devised to efficiently optimize the spatial filters in conjunction with a band-pass filter. The proposed method is compared with two existing methods on real data: a BCI Competition IV dataset as well as our data collected from seven human subjects. The results indicate the superior performance of the method for motor imagery classification, as it produced higher classification accuracy with statistical significance ( ≥ 95% confidence level) in most cases."
21162666,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow users to control a computer application by brain activity as acquired (e.g., by EEG). In our classic machine learning approach to BCIs, the participants undertake a calibration measurement without feedback to acquire data to train the BCI system. After the training, the user can control a BCI and improve the operation through some type of feedback. However, not all BCI users are able to perform sufficiently well during feedback operation. In fact, a nonnegligible portion of participants (estimated 15%-30%) cannot control the system (a BCI illiteracy problem, generic to all motor-imagery-based BCIs). We hypothesize that one main difficulty for a BCI user is the transition from offline calibration to online feedback. In this work, we investigate adaptive machine learning methods to eliminate offline calibration and analyze the performance of 11 volunteers in a BCI based on the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms. We present an adaptation scheme that individually guides the user. It starts with a subject-independent classifier that evolves to a subject-optimized state-of-the-art classifier within one session while the user interacts continuously. These initial runs use supervised techniques for robust coadaptive learning of user and machine. Subsequent runs use unsupervised adaptation to track the features' drift during the session and provide an unbiased measure of BCI performance. Using this approach, without any offline calibration, six users, including one novice, obtained good performance after 3 to 6 minutes of adaptation. More important, this novel guided learning also allows participants with BCI illiteracy to gain significant control with the BCI in less than 60 minutes. In addition, one volunteer without sensorimotor idle rhythm peak at the beginning of the BCI experiment developed it during the course of the session and used voluntary modulation of its amplitude to control the feedback application.

21156054,"There is now sufficient evidence that using a rehabilitation protocol involving motor imagery (MI) practice in conjunction with physical practice (PP) of goal-directed rehabilitation tasks leads to enhanced functional recovery of paralyzed limbs among stroke sufferers. It is however difficult to confirm patient engagement during an MI in the absence of any on-line measure. Fortunately an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) can provide an on-line measure of MI activity as a neurofeedback for the BCI user to help him/her focus better on the MI task. However initial performance of novice BCI users may be quite moderate and may cause frustration. This paper reports a pilot study in which a BCI system is used to provide a computer game-based neurofeedback to stroke participants during the MI part of a protocol. The participants included five chronic hemiplegic stroke sufferers. Participants received up to twelve 30-minute MI practice sessions (in conjunction with PP sessions of the same duration) on 2 days a week for 6 weeks. The BCI neurofeedback performance was evaluated based on the MI task classification accuracy (CA) rate. A set of outcome measures including action research arm test (ARAT) and grip strength (GS), was made use of in assessing the upper limb functional recovery. In addition, since stroke sufferers often experience physical tiredness, which may influence the protocol effectiveness, their fatigue and mood levels were assessed regularly. Positive improvement in at least one of the outcome measures was observed in all the participants, while improvements approached a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the ARAT. The on-line CA of MI induced sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) modulation patterns in the form of lateralized event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) effects, for novice participants was in a moderate range of 60-75% within the limited 12 training sessions. The ERD/ERS change from the first to the last session was statistically significant for only two participants. Overall the crucial observation is that the moderate BCI classification performance did not impede the positive rehabilitation trends as quantified with the rehabilitation outcome measures adopted in this study. Therefore it can be concluded that the BCI supported MI is a feasible intervention as part of a post-stroke rehabilitation protocol combining both PP and MI practice of rehabilitation tasks. Although these findings are promising, the scope of the final conclusions is limited by the small sample size and the lack of a control group."
21097232,"We here studied the efficacy of wide-band frequency spectra (WBFS) features using multi-taper (MT) spectral analysis in application to motor imagery based Brain Computer Interfaces. We acquired motor imagery task related human scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals for left vs. right hand movements using 3 different pairs of visual arrow cues. Left vs. right movement imagery discrimination was conducted using a Naïve Bayesian classifier using WBFS features and commonly used Mu-Beta spectral features for EEG signals from central+parietal and central only electrode positions. Task discrimination accuracy results showed that WBFS features using MT spectral analysis provided significantly better performance (with a 95% confidence level) than that of using Mu-Beta spectral features commonly used. The use of central+parietal electrode signals improved discrimination accuracy significantly when compared to the accuracy using the central only signals, implying that sensory information enhanced task discrimination significantly."
21097231,"The online performance of a motor imagery-based Brain-Computer Interface (MI-BCI) influences its effectiveness and usability in real-world clinical applications such as the restoration of motor control. The online performance depends on factors such as the different feedback techniques and motivation of the subject. This paper investigates the online performance of the MI-BCI with an augmented-reality (AR) 3D virtual hand feedback. The subject experiences the interaction with 3D virtual hands, which have been superimposed onto his real hands and displayed on the computer monitor from a first person point-of-view. While performing motor imagery, he receives continuous visual feedback from the MI-BCI in the form of different degrees of reaching and grasping actions of the 3D virtual hands with other virtual objects. The AR feedback is compared with the conventional horizontal bar feedback on 8 subjects, of whom 7 are BCI-naïve. The subjects found the AR feedback to be more engaging and motivating. Despite the higher mental workload involved in the AR feedback, their online MI-BCI performance compared to the conventional horizontal bar feedback was not affected. The results provide motivation to further develop and refine the AR feedback protocol for MI-BCI."
21096902,"In this paper, we evaluated BCI algorithm using CSP for finding out about realistic possibility of BCI based on CSP. BCI algorithm that was comprised of CSP and least square linear classifier was evaluated in 10 persons. According to the result of the experiment, the effect of combined cue and neurofeedback is evaluated. In case of combined cue, the correlation of combined cue and visual cue is higher than other conditions. And in case of neurofeedback, some subject is exceptional but general trend shows the performance improvement by neurofeedback."
21096894,"In this paper, a hybrid EEG-based brain computer interface (BCI) is designed for two-dimensional cursor control. In our approach, two brain activity patterns, i.e., motor imagery and P300 potential, are used for controlling the horizontal and the vertical movements of the cursor respectively. A real-time BCI system based on this approach is implemented and evaluated through an online experiment. Six subjects attending this experiment can perform 2-D cursor control effectively. Our experimental results show that the system has the following merits compared with prior systems: 1) it does not rely on intensive user training; 2) it allows cursor movement between arbitrary positions."
21096475,"This clinical study investigates the ability of hemiparetic stroke patients in operating EEG-based motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). It also assesses the efficacy in motor improvements on the stroke-affected upper limb using EEG-based MI-BCI with robotic feedback neurorehabilitation compared to robotic rehabilitation that delivers movement therapy. 54 hemiparetic stroke patients with mean age of 51.8 and baseline Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) 14.9 (out of 66, higher = better) were recruited. Results showed that 48 subjects (89%) operated EEG-based MI-BCI better than at chance level, and their ability to operate EEG-based MI-BCI is not correlated to their baseline FMA (r=0.358). Those subjects who gave consent are randomly assigned to each group (N=11 and 14) for 12 1-hour rehabilitation sessions for 4 weeks. Significant gains in FMA scores were observed in both groups at post-rehabilitation (4.5, 6.2; p=0.032, 0.003) and 2-month post-rehabilitation (5.3, 7.3; p=0.020, 0.013), but no significant differences were observed between groups (p=0.512, 0.550). Hence, this study showed evidences that a majority of hemiparetic stroke patients can operate EEG-based MI-BCI, and that EEG-based MI-BCI with robotic feedback neurorehabilitation is effective in restoring upper extremities motor function in stroke."
21096265,"Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are often obscured by physiological artifacts that can render huge amounts of data useless and thus constitute a key challenge in current brain-computer interface research. This paper presents a new algorithm that automatically and reliably removes artifacts from EEG based on blind source separation and support vector machine. Performance on a motor imagery task is compared for artifact-contaminated and preprocessed signals to verify the accuracy of the proposed approach. The results showed improved results over all datasets. Furthermore, the online applicability of the algorithm is investigated."
21096242,"Due to the artifacts in electroencephalography (EEG) data, the performance of brain-computer interface (BCI) is degraded. On the other hand, in the motor imagery based BCI system, EEG signals are usually contaminated by the misleading trials caused by improper imagination of a movement. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to detect the abnormal EEG data using genetic algorithm (GA). After trial pruning, a subset of the EEG data are selected, on which common spatial pattern (CSP) and Gaussian classifier are trained. The performance of the proposed method is tested on Data set IIa of BCI Competition IV, and the simulation result demonstrates a significant improvement for six out of nine subjects."
21095857,"There is a step of significant difficulty experienced by brain-computer interface (BCI) users when going from the calibration recording to the feedback application. This effect has been previously studied and a supervised adaptation solution has been proposed. In this paper, we suggest a simple unsupervised adaptation method of the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier that effectively solves this problem by counteracting the harmful effect of nonclass-related nonstationarities in electroencephalography (EEG) during BCI sessions performed with motor imagery tasks. For this, we first introduce three types of adaptation procedures and investigate them in an offline study with 19 datasets. Then, we select one of the proposed methods and analyze it further. The chosen classifier is offline tested in data from 80 healthy users and four high spinal cord injury patients. Finally, for the first time in BCI literature, we apply this unsupervised classifier in online experiments. Additionally, we show that its performance is significantly better than the state-of-the-art supervised approach."
21095811,"We localize the sources of class-dependent event-related desynchronisation (ERD) of the mu-rhythm related to different types of motor imagery in Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI) sessions. Our approach is based on localization of single-trial Fourier coefficients using sparse basis field expansions (S-FLEX). The analysis reveals focal sources in the sensorimotor cortices, a finding which can be regarded as a proof for the expected neurophysiological origin of the BCI control signal. As a technical contribution, we extend S-FLEX to the multiple measurement case in a way that the activity of different frequency bins within the mu-band is coherently localized."
20859445,"For individuals with a high spinal cord injury (SCI) not only the lower limbs, but also the upper extremities are paralyzed. A neuroprosthesis can be used to restore the lost hand and arm function in those tetraplegics. The main problem for this group of individuals, however, is the reduced ability to voluntarily operate device controllers. A brain-computer interface provides a non-manual alternative to conventional input devices by translating brain activity patterns into control commands. We show that the temporal coding of individual mental imagery pattern can be used to control two independent degrees of freedom - grasp and elbow function - of an artificial robotic arm by utilizing a minimum number of EEG scalp electrodes. We describe the procedure from the initial screening to the final application. From eight naïve subjects participating online feedback experiments, four were able to voluntarily control an artificial arm by inducing one motor imagery pattern derived from one EEG derivation only."
20844441,"Feature extractor and classifier are two major components in a brain-computer interface system, in which the feature extractor plays a critical role. To increase the discriminability of features or feature vectors used for classification, it is necessary to select a suitable number of task-related data recording channels. In this article, a machine-learning algorithm is proposed for optimizing feature extraction in an electrocorticogram-based brain-computer interface. Common spatial pattern was used for feature extraction, and channel selection was performed by genetic algorithm for optimizing the feature extraction. Fisher discriminant analysis was used as classifier, and the channel subset chosen at each generation was evaluated by classification accuracy. The algorithm was applied to three electrocorticogram datasets that were recorded during two kinds of motor imagery tasks. The results suggest that the channel number used for building a brain-computer interface system could be significantly decreased without losing classification accuracy, and the accuracy rate could be noticeably improved by using the optimal channel subsets chosen by genetic algorithm."
20841636,"This paper addresses an important issue in a self-paced brain-computer interface (BCI): constructing subject-specific continuous control signal. To this end, we propose an alternative to the conventional regression/classification-based mechanism for building the transformation from EEG features into a univariate control signal. Based on information theory, the mechanism formulates the optimum transformation as maximizing the mutual information between the control signal and the mental state. We introduce a non-parametric mutual information estimate for general output distribution, and then develop a gradient-based algorithm to optimize the transformation using training data. We conduct an offline simulation study using motor imagery data from the BCI Competition IV Data Set I. The results show that the learning algorithm converged quickly, and the proposed method yielded significantly higher BCI performance than the conventional mechanism."
20832477,"We propose a novel approach to solving the electro-/magnetoencephalographic (EEG/MEG) inverse problem which is based upon a decomposition of the current density into a small number of spatial basis fields. It is designed to recover multiple sources of possibly different extent and depth, while being invariant with respect to phase angles and rotations of the coordinate system. We demonstrate the method's ability to reconstruct simulated sources of random shape and show that the accuracy of the recovered sources can be increased, when interrelated field patterns are co-localized. Technically, this leads to large-scale mathematical problems, which are solved using recent advances in convex optimization. We apply our method for localizing brain areas involved in different types of motor imagery using real data from Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) sessions. Our approach based on single-trial localization of complex Fourier coefficients yields class-specific focal sources in the sensorimotor cortices."
20800538,"To investigate movement imagery-related lateralization of event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) during two motor-imagery tasks with varying movement duration (brief versus continuous). Twelve subjects performed or kinesthetically imagined the indicated movement (left or right hand movement) for 1 s (brief) or 5 s (continuous) while electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded using 16 electrodes covering the sensorimotor cortex of the brain according to the modified 10-20 system. Significant hemispheric differences were found between contralateral and ipsilateral area in mu ERD, mu ERS and beta ERD during both brief and continuous conditions, showing contralateral dominance of mu and beta ERD and ipsilateral dominance of mu ERS. Beta ERS showed a significant ipsilateral dominance only in the brief condition. Movement imagery duration influenced the lateralization of mu ERD, beta ERD, and beta ERS, but not mu ERS. The results of this study will aid in clarifying movement-related lateralization in association with imagery tasks under varying movement duration. For designing an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) for people with severe neuromuscular impairments, movement imagery-related lateralization can play a key role in utilizing motor-imagery tasks as a control or communication strategy."
20659350,"Even though feedback is considered to play an important role in learning how to operate a brain-computer interface (BCI), to date no significant influence of feedback design on BCI-performance has been reported in literature. In this work, we adapt a standard motor-imagery BCI-paradigm to study how BCI-performance is affected by biasing the belief subjects have on their level of control over the BCI system. Our findings indicate that subjects already capable of operating a BCI are impeded by inaccurate feedback, while subjects normally performing on or close to chance level may actually benefit from an incorrect belief on their performance level. Our results imply that optimal feedback design in BCIs should take into account a subject's current skill level."
20615806,"Two-dimensional cursor control is an important and challenging issue in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). To address this issue, here we propose a new approach by combining two brain signals including Mu/Beta rhythm during motor imagery and P300 potential. In particular, a motor imagery detection mechanism and a P300 potential detection mechanism are devised and integrated such that the user is able to use the two signals to control, respectively, simultaneously, and independently, the horizontal and the vertical movements of the cursor in a specially designed graphic user interface. A real-time BCI system based on this approach is implemented and evaluated through an online experiment involving six subjects performing 2-D control tasks. The results attest to the efficacy of obtaining two independent control signals by the proposed approach. Furthermore, the results show that the system has merit compared with prior systems: it allows cursor movement between arbitrary positions."
20582271,"Nowadays, everybody knows what a hybrid car is. A hybrid car normally has two engines to enhance energy efficiency and reduce CO2 output. Similarly, a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) is composed of two BCIs, or at least one BCI and another system. A hybrid BCI, like any BCI, must fulfill the following four criteria: (i) the device must rely on signals recorded directly from the brain; (ii) there must be at least one recordable brain signal that the user can intentionally modulate to effect goal-directed behaviour; (iii) real time processing; and (iv) the user must obtain feedback. This paper introduces hybrid BCIs that have already been published or are in development. We also introduce concepts for future work. We describe BCIs that classify two EEG patterns: one is the event-related (de)synchronisation (ERD, ERS) of sensorimotor rhythms, and the other is the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP). Hybrid BCIs can either process their inputs simultaneously, or operate two systems sequentially, where the first system can act as a ""brain switch"". For example, we describe a hybrid BCI that simultaneously combines ERD and SSVEP BCIs. We also describe a sequential hybrid BCI, in which subjects could use a brain switch to control an SSVEP-based hand orthosis. Subjects who used this hybrid BCI exhibited about half the false positives encountered while using the SSVEP BCI alone. A brain switch can also rely on hemodynamic changes measured through near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Hybrid BCIs can also use one brain signal and a different type of input. This additional input can be an electrophysiological signal such as the heart rate, or a signal from an external device such as an eye tracking system."
20470224,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) present an alternative way of communication for people with severe disabilities. One of the shortcomings in current BCI systems, recently put forward in the fourth BCI competition, is the asynchronous detection of motor imagery versus resting state. We investigated this extension to the three-class case, in which the resting state is considered virtually lying between two motor classes, resulting in a large penalty when one motor task is misclassified into the other motor class. We particularly focus on the behavior of different machine-learning techniques and on the role of multi-class cost-sensitive learning in such a context. To this end, four different kernel methods are empirically compared, namely pairwise multi-class support vector machines (SVMs), two cost-sensitive multi-class SVMs and kernel-based ordinal regression. The experimental results illustrate that ordinal regression performs better than the other three approaches when a cost-sensitive performance measure such as the mean-squared error is considered. By contrast, multi-class cost-sensitive learning enables us to control the number of large errors made between two motor tasks."
20451626,"Gamma oscillations of the electromagnetic field of the brain are known to be involved in a variety of cognitive processes, and are believed to be fundamental for information processing within the brain. While gamma oscillations have been shown to be correlated with brain rhythms at different frequencies, to date no empirical evidence has been presented that supports a causal influence of gamma oscillations on other brain rhythms. In this work, we study the relation of gamma oscillations and the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) in healthy human subjects using electroencephalography. We first demonstrate that modulation of the SMR, induced by motor imagery of either the left or right hand, is positively correlated with the power of frontal and occipital gamma oscillations, and negatively correlated with the power of centro-parietal gamma oscillations. We then demonstrate that the most simple causal structure, capable of explaining the observed correlation of gamma oscillations and the SMR, entails a causal influence of gamma oscillations on the SMR. This finding supports the fundamental role attributed to gamma oscillations for information processing within the brain, and is of particular importance for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). As modulation of the SMR is typically used in BCIs to infer a subject's intention, our findings entail that gamma oscillations have a causal influence on a subject's capability to utilize a BCI for means of communication."
20435514,To provide candidate electrode sites and neurophysiological reference information for cognitive tasks used in brain-computer interfacing research. Six cognitive tasks were tested against the idle state. Data representing the idle state were collected with active cognitive task data during each recording session. Cross subject candidate electrode sites were obtained via a wrapper method based upon a sequential forward floating search algorithm. Source localisation results were obtained using sLORETA software. Spatial feature distributions and localisation results are presented. Primary centres of activity for motor imagery tasks are localised to the pre- and postcentral gyrus. Auditory-based tasks show activity in the middle temporal gyrus. Calculation activity was localised to the left inferior frontal gyrus and right supramarginal gyrus. Navigation imagery produced activity in the precuneus and anterior cingulate cortex. Spatial areas of activation suggest that arithmetic and auditory tasks show promise for pairwise discrimination based on single recording sites. sLORETA significance levels suggest that motor imagery tasks will show greatest discrimination from baseline EEG activity. This is the first study to provide candidate electrode sites for multiple tasks used in brain-computer interfacing.
20381529,"In this paper, a feature extraction method through the time-series prediction based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is proposed for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. The ANFIS time-series prediction together with multiresolution fractal feature vectors (MFFVs) is applied for feature extraction in motor imagery (MI) classification. The features are extracted from the electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded from subjects performing left and right MI. Two ANFISs are trained to perform time-series predictions for respective left and right MI data. Features obtained from the difference of MFFVs between the predicted and actual signals are then calculated through a window of EEG signals. Finally, a simple linear classifier, namely linear discriminant analysis (LDA), is used for classification. The proposed method is estimated with classification accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) on six subjects from two data sets. I also assess the performance of proposed method by comparing it with well-known linear adaptive autoregressive (AAR) model, AAR time-series prediction, and neural network (NN) time-series prediction. The results indicate that ANFIS time-series prediction together with MFFV features is a promising method in MI classification."
20347612,"Patients usually require long-term training for effective EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) control due to fatigue caused by the demands for focused attention during prolonged BCI operation. We intended to develop a user-friendly BCI requiring minimal training and less mental load. Testing of BCI performance was investigated in three patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and three patients with primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), who had no previous BCI experience. All patients performed binary control of cursor movement. One ALS patient and one PLS patient performed four-directional cursor control in a two-dimensional domain under a BCI paradigm associated with human natural motor behavior using motor execution and motor imagery. Subjects practiced for 5-10min and then participated in a multi-session study of either binary control or four-directional control including online BCI game over 1.5-2h in a single visit. Event-related desynchronization and event-related synchronization in the beta band were observed in all patients during the production of voluntary movement either by motor execution or motor imagery. The online binary control of cursor movement was achieved with an average accuracy about 82.1+/-8.2% with motor execution and about 80% with motor imagery, whereas offline accuracy was achieved with 91.4+/-3.4% with motor execution and 83.3+/-8.9% with motor imagery after optimization. In addition, four-directional cursor control was achieved with an accuracy of 50-60% with motor execution and motor imagery. Patients with ALS or PLS may achieve BCI control without extended training, and fatigue might be reduced during operation of a BCI associated with human natural motor behavior. The development of a user-friendly BCI will promote practical BCI applications in paralyzed patients."
20347386,"To develop a practical motor imagery-based brain-controlled switch as functional as a real-world switch that is reliable with a minimal false positive operation rate and convenient for users without the need of attention to the switch during a 'No Control' state (when not to activate the switch). Four healthy volunteers were instructed to perform an intended motor imagery task following an external sync signal in order to turn on a virtual switch provided on a computer screen. No specific mental task was required during the 'No Control' state. The beta band event-related frequency power (event-related desynchronization or ERD) from a single EEG Laplacian channel was monitored online in real-time. The computer continuously monitored the relative ERD power level until it exceeded a pre-set threshold and turned on the virtual switch. Subject 1 achieved lowest average false positive rate of 0.4+/-0.9% in a five-session online study during the entire 'No Control' state, whereby the subject required 6.8+/-0.6 s of active urging time or total response time of 20.5+/-1.9 s to perform repeated attempts in order to turn on the switch in the online interactive switch operation. The average false positive rate among four subjects was 0.8+/-0.4% with average active urging time of 12.3+/-4.4 s or average response time of 36.9+/-13.0 s. Offline analysis from subject 2 shows that the overall performance from 10-fold cross-validation was 96.2% with 3 consecutive epoch averaging, which was further improved to 99.0% by computationally intensive methods. The novel design of the brain-controlled switch using the ERD feature associated with motor imagery achieved minimal false positive rate with a reasonable active urging time or response time to activate the switch. The reliability and convenience of the developed brain-controlled switch may extend current brain-computer interface capacities in practical communication and control applications."
20204836,"We describe the set-up for an electrical muscle stimulation device based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), designed for use as a brain-computer interface (BCI). Employing multi-channel NIRS, we measured evoked cerebral blood oxygenation (CBO) responses during real motor tasks and motor-imagery tasks. When a supra-threshold increase in oxyhemoglobin concentration was detected, electrical stimulation (50 Hz) of the biceps brachii muscle was applied to the side contralateral to the hand grasping task or ipsilateral to the motor-imagery task. We observed relatively stable and reproducible CBO responses during real motor tasks with an average accuracy of 100%, and during motor imagery tasks with an average accuracy of 61.5%. Flexion movement of the arm was evoked in all volunteers in association with electrical muscle stimulation and no adverse effects were noted. These findings suggest that application of the electrical muscle stimulation system based on a NIRS-BCI is non-invasive and safe, and may be useful for the physical training of disabled patients."
20192030,"Recent advances in brain activity analysis and computational algorithms have enabled people with severe motor disorders to control external devices via brain activity. Brain-machine interface (BMI)/brain-computer interface has gained importance as the ultimate strategy for functional compensation because it improves impaired neuromuscular systems. Invasive BMI performed using needle arrays can best control robotic arms or computer cursors because it records neural activity in the primary motor cortex in detail. The extensive and validated physiological background of recorded signals enables researchers to develop highly accurate BMI systems with needle electrodes. Less invasive neural recording with an electrocorticogram (ECoG)-electrode array provides good temporal and spatial information for use in prosthetic control. ECoG electrodes have wide clinical applications in pain control and epilepsy; therefore, techniques for electrode implantation are well established compared to those for needle arrays. These electrodes may find wide clinical applications if their accuracy level reaches that suitable for practical use. Noninvasive BMI involving neural recording by electroencephalography (EEG) is the most widely used technique because of a convenient experimental setup, although it provides a limited range of decodable motor outputs. In EEG, arc-shaped mu rhythms of 8-12 Hz appear around the sensorimotor area in the resting state and diminish in amplitude during motor imagery. Thus, the mu rhythm amplitude may correlate with cortical excitability of the sensorimotor area, and EEG-BMI may be useful in the neurorehabilitation of patients with stroke-induced hemiplegia. Research on BMI as a therapeutic tool though emergent, may widen the scope of conventional BMI."
20168002,"The relationship between primary motor cortex and movement kinematics has been shown in nonhuman primate studies of hand reaching or drawing tasks. Studies have demonstrated that the neural activities accompanying or immediately preceding the movement encode the direction, speed and other information. Here we investigated the relationship between the kinematics of imagined and actual hand movement, i.e. the clenching speed, and the EEG activity in ten human subjects. Study participants were asked to perform and imagine clenching of the left hand and right hand at various speeds. The EEG activity in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (18-28 Hz) frequency bands were found to be linearly correlated with the speed of imagery clenching. Similar parametric modulation was also found during the execution of hand movements. A single equation relating the EEG activity to the speed and the hand (left versus right) was developed. This equation, which contained a linear independent combination of the two parameters, described the time-varying neural activity during the tasks. Based on the model, a regression approach was developed to decode the two parameters from the multiple-channel EEG signals. We demonstrated the continuous decoding of dynamic hand and speed information of the imagined clenching. In particular, the time-varying clenching speed was reconstructed in a bell-shaped profile. Our findings suggest an application to providing continuous and complex control of noninvasive brain-computer interface for movement-impaired paralytics."
20168001,"Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has recently been investigated as a non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI). In particular, previous research has shown that NIRS signals recorded from the motor cortex during left- and right-hand imagery can be distinguished, providing a basis for a two-choice NIRS-BCI. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of an alternative two-choice NIRS-BCI paradigm based on the classification of prefrontal activity due to two cognitive tasks, specifically mental arithmetic and music imagery. Deploying a dual-wavelength frequency domain near-infrared spectrometer, we interrogated nine sites around the frontopolar locations (International 10-20 System) while ten able-bodied adults performed mental arithmetic and music imagery within a synchronous shape-matching paradigm. With the 18 filtered AC signals, we created task- and subject-specific maximum likelihood classifiers using hidden Markov models. Mental arithmetic and music imagery were classified with an average accuracy of 77.2% +/- 7.0 across participants, with all participants significantly exceeding chance accuracies. The results suggest the potential of a two-choice NIRS-BCI based on cognitive rather than motor tasks."
20144923,"This work introduces a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) composed of an imagery-based brain switch and a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI. The brain switch (event related synchronization (ERS)-based BCI) was used to activate the four-step SSVEP-based orthosis (via gazing at a 8 Hz LED to open and gazing at a 13 Hz LED to close) only when needed for control, and to deactivate the LEDs during resting periods. Only two EEG channels were required, one over the motor cortex and one over the visual cortex. As a basis for comparison, the orthosis was also operated without using the brain switch. Six subjects participated in this study. This combination of two BCIs operated with different mental strategies is one example of a ""hybrid"" BCI and revealed a much lower rate of FPs per minute during resting periods or breaks compared to the SSVEP BCI alone ( FP=1.46+/-1.18 versus 5.40 +/- 0.90). Four out of the six subjects succeeded in operating the self-paced hybrid BCI with a good performance (positive prediction value PPVb > 0.70)."
20143173,"This article reports on a study to identify electroencephalography (EEG) signals with potential to provide new BCI channels through mental motor imagery (MMI). Leg motion was assessed to see if left and right leg MMI could be discriminated in the EEG. The study also explored simultaneous observation of leg movement as a means to enhance MMI evoked EEG signals. The results demonstrate that MMI of the left and right leg produce a contralateral preponderance of EEG alpha band desynchronization, which can be spatially discriminated. This suggests that lower extremity MMI could provide signals for additional BCI channels. The study also shows that movement imitation enhances alpha band desynchronization during MMI, and might provide a useful aid in the identification and training of BCI signals."
20052556,"Bringing a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) out of the lab one of the main problems has to be solved: to shorten the training time. Finding a solution for this problem, the use of a BCI will be open not only for people who have no choice, e.g., persons in a locked-in state, or suffering from a degenerating nerve disease. By reducing the training time to a minimum, also healthy persons will make use of the system, e.g., for using this kind of control for games. For realizing such a control, the post-movement beta rebound occurring after brisk feet movement was used to set up a classifier. This classifier was then used in a cue-based motor imagery system. After classifier adaptation, a self-paced brain-switch based on brisk foot motor imagery (MI) was evaluated. Four out of six subjects showed that a post-movement beta rebound after feet MI and succeeded with a true positive rate between 69 and 89%, while the positive predictive value was between 75 and 93%."
20041311,"The aim of this study was to compare methods for feature extraction and classification of EEG signals for a brain-computer interface (BCI) driven by auditory and spatial navigation imagery. Features were extracted using autoregressive modeling and optimized discrete wavelet transform. The features were selected with exhaustive search, from the combination of features of two and three channels, and with a discriminative measure (r (2)). Moreover, Bayesian classifier and support vector machine (SVM) with Gaussian kernel were compared. The results showed that the two classifiers provided similar classification accuracy. Conversely, the exhaustive search of the optimal combination of features from two and three channels significantly improved performance with respect to using r(2) for channel selection. With features optimally extracted from three channels with optimized scaling filter in the discrete wavelet transform, the classification accuracy was on average 72.2%. Thus, the choice of features had greater impact on performance than the choice of the classifier for discrimination between the two non-motor imagery tasks investigated. The results are relevant for the choice of the translation algorithm for an on-line BCI system based on non-motor imagery."
20011144,We discuss three experiments that investigate how virtual limbs and bodies can come to feel like real limbs and bodies. The first experiment shows that an illusion of ownership of a virtual arm appearing to project out of a person's shoulder can be produced by tactile stimulation on a person's hidden real hand and synchronous stimulation on the seen virtual hand. The second shows that the illusion can be produced by synchronous movement of the person's hidden real hand and a virtual hand. The third shows that a weaker form of the illusion can be produced when a brain-computer interface is employed to move the virtual hand by means of motor imagery without any tactile stimulation. We discuss related studies that indicate that the ownership illusion may be generated for an entire body. This has important implications for the scientific understanding of body ownership and several practical applications.
19965253,"Non-invasive EEG-based motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) holds promise to effectively restore motor control to stroke survivors. This clinical study investigates the effects of MI-BCI for upper limb robotic rehabilitation compared to standard robotic rehabilitation. The subjects are hemiparetic stroke patients with mean age of 50.2 and baseline Fugl-Meyer (FM) score 29.7 (out of 66, higher = better) randomly assigned to each group respectively (N = 8 and 10). Each subject underwent 12 sessions of 1-hour rehabilitation for 4 weeks. Significant gains in FM scores were observed in both groups at post-rehabilitation (4.9, p = 0.001) and 2-month post-rehabilitation (4.9, p = 0.002). The experimental group yielded higher 2-month post-rehabilitation gain than the control (6.0 versus 4.0) but no significance was found (p = 0.475). However, among subjects with positive gain (N = 6 and 7), the initial difference of 2.8 between the two groups was increased to a significant 6.5 (p = 0.019) after adjustment for age and gender. Hence this study provides evidence that BCI-driven robotic rehabilitation is effective in restoring motor control for stroke."
19965154,"The aim of this paper is to investigate the possibility of using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method in detecting the desynchronized mu rhythm of motor imagery EEG signal. A number of EEG studies have identified the mu rhythm desynchronization a reliable EEG pattern for brain-computer interface. Considering the non-stationary characteristics of the motor imagery EEG, the EMD method is proposed to decompose the EEG signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). By analyzing the power spectral density (PSD) of the IMFs, the characteristics one representing mu rhythm oscillations can be detected. Then by Hilbert transformation, the event-related desynchronization phenomenon can be found by the envelope of the characteristics IMF. Results demonstrate that the EMD method is an effective time-frequency analysis tool for non-stationary EEG signal."
19965103,"Multichannel neural activities such as EEG or ECoG in a brain computer interface can be classified with subset selection algorithms running on large feature dictionaries describing subject specific features in spectral, temporal and spatial domain. While providing high accuracies in classification, the subset selection techniques are associated with long training times due to the large feature set constructed from multichannel neural recordings. In this paper we study a novel denoising technique for reducing the dimensionality of the feature space which decreases the computational complexity of the subset selection step radically without causing any degradation in the final classification accuracy. The denoising procedure was based on the comparison of the energy in a particular time segment and in a given scale/level to the energy of the raw data. By setting denoising threshold a priori the algorithm removes those nodes which fail to capture the energy in the raw data in a given scale. We provide experimental studies towards the classification of motor imagery related multichannel ECoG recordings for a brain computer interface. The denoising procedure was able to reach the same classification accuracy without denoising and a computational complexity around 5 times smaller. We also note that in some cases the denoised procedure performed better classification."
19964841,"Motor imagery is a popular paradigm in electrophysiology research and brain computer interface but the evoked EEG signals always contaminated significantly. In this paper we use the Independent Component Analysis to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of multi trail EEG signals evoked by imaginary hand movement. Infomax algorithm was used to decompose multi channel EEG signals into independent components trail by trail, and then an automatic clustering method was used to group these components into several clusters. For the higher similarity between task relevant components, they can be assembled into one cluster that occupies the highest mean mutual information of pairwise components intra cluster. Furthermore, the reconstructed signals of task relevant cluster showed a high discrepancy features to left versus right hand task, which evaluated by Fisher criterion scores and served as the signal-to-noise ratio measurement."
19964789,"BrainNetVis is an application, written in Java, that displays and analyzes synchronization networks from brain signals. The program implements a number of network indices and visualization techniques. We demonstrate its use through a case study of left hand and foot motor imagery. The data sets were provided by the Berlin BCI group. Using this program we managed to find differences between the average left hand and foot synchronization networks by comparing them with the average idle state synchronization network."
19964656,"This paper addresses the issue of selecting optimal spatio-spectral features, which is key to high performance motor imagery (MI) classification that is in turn one of the central topics in EEG-based brain computer interfaces. In particular, this work proposes a novel method which first formulates the selection of features as maximizing mutual information between class labels and features. It then uses a robust estimate of mutual information, within a filter-bank and common spatial pattern feature extraction framework, to select an effective feature set. We have assessed the proposed method on both BCI Competition IV Set I and a separate data set collected in our lab from 7 healthy subjects. The results indicate the method is effective in selecting optimal spatial-spectral features for classification."
19964647,"A major limitation of current Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) based on Motor Imagery (MI) is that they are subject-specific BCI, which require data recording and system training for each new user. This process is time consuming and inconvenient, especially for casual users or portable BCI with limited computational resources. In this paper, we explore the design of a Subject-Independent (SI) MI-based BCI, i.e., a BCI that can be used immediately by any new user without training the BCI with the user's data. This is achieved by training the BCI on data acquired from several other subjects. In order to assess the possibility to build such a BCI, we compared several designs based on different features and classifiers, on data from 9 subjects. Our results suggested that linear classifiers were the most appropriate for the design of MI-based SI-BCI. We also proposed a filter bank common spatial patterns feature extraction method based on a multi-resolution frequency decomposition which achieved the highest accuracy."
19964437,"What is the optimal number of electrodes one can use in discrimination of tasks for a Brain Computer Interface (BCI)? To address this question, the number and location of scalp electrodes in the acquisition of human electroencephalography (EEG) and discrimination of motor imagery tasks were optimized by using a systematic optimization approach. The systematic analysis results in the most reliable procedure in electrode optimization as well as a validating means for the other feature selection techniques. We acquired human scalp EEG in response to cue-based motor imagery tasks. We employed a systematic analysis by using all possible combinations of the channels and calculating task discrimination errors for each of these combinations by using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for feature classification. Channel combination that resulted in the smallest discrimination error was selected as the optimum number of channels to be used in BCI applications. Results from the systematic analysis were compared with another feature selection algorithm: forward stepwise feature selection combined with LDA feature classification. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of the fully optimized technique for a reliable selection of scalp electrodes in BCI applications."
19964231,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) to detect motor imagery from cerebrum hemodynamic data measured by NIRS (near-infrared spectroscopy) was constructed and the effect of the online feedback training for subjects was evaluated. Concentrations of Oxy- and deOxy-hemoglobin in the motor cortex during motor imagery of subject's right hand was measured by 52-channel NIRS system, and the mean magnitude of measured signal near C3 in the International 10-20 System was visually fed back online to the subject. On two out of three subjects, it was shown that the ratio between the averaged value and the standard deviation over trials (S/N ratio) of Oxy-hemoglobin signal elicited by the imagery of subject's right hand was increased by the 5-day online feedback training. Detailed investigation of the effect of the online feedback training on brain activities was left for further study."
19964225,"The objective of this research is to explore whether a two-dimensional BCI can be achieved by reliably decoding single-trial magneto-encephalography (MEG) signal associated with sustaining or ceasing right and left hand movements. Seven naïve subjects participated in the study. Signals were recorded from 275-channel MEG and synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) was employed. The multi-class classification for four-directional control was evaluated offline from 10-fold cross-validation using direct-decision tree classifier and genetic algorithm based Mahalanobis linear distance. Beta band (15-30Hz) event-related desynchronization and event related synchronization were observed in right and left hand movement related motor areas for physical movements as well as motor imagery. The cross-validation accuracy for the proposed four-direction classification from SAM- filtered MEG signal was as high as 95-97% for physical movements and 86-87% for motor imagery. The high classification accuracy suggests that a reliable high performance two-dimensional BCI can be achieved from single trial detection of human natural movement intentions from SAM-filtered MEG signals, where user may not need extensive training."
19963834,"This study aims to explore whether human intentions to move or cease to move right and left hands can provide four spatiotemporal patterns in single-trial non-invasive EEG signals to achieve a two-dimensional cursor control. Subjects performed motor tasks by either physical movement or motor imagery. Spatial filtering, temporal filtering, feature selection and classification methods were explored to support accurate computer pattern recognition. The performance was evaluated by both offline classification and online two-dimensional cursor control. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) and post-movement event-related synchronization (ERS) were observed on the contralateral hemisphere to the moving hand for both physical movement and motor imagery. The offline classification of four motor tasks provided 10-fold cross-validation accuracy as high as 88% for physical movement and 73% for motor imagery. Subjects participating in experiments with physical movement were able to complete the online game with the average accuracy of 85.5 + or - 4.65%; Subjects participating in motor imagery study also completed the game successfully. The proposed brain-computer interface (BCI) provided a new practical multi-dimensional method by noninvasive EEG signal associated with human natural behavior, which does not need long-term training."
19963715,"The Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) algorithm performs autonomous selection of key temporal-spatial discriminative EEG characteristics in motor imagery-based Brain Computer Interfaces (MI-BCI). However, FBCSP is sensitive to outliers because it involves multiple estimations of covariance matrices from EEG measurements. This paper proposes a Robust FBCSP (RFBCSP) algorithm whereby the estimates of the covariance matrices are replaced with the robust Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) estimator. The performance of RFBCSP is investigated on a publicly available dataset and compared against FBCSP using 10x10-fold cross-validation accuracies on training data, and session-to-session transfer kappa values on independent test data. The results showed that RFBCSP yielded improvements in certain subjects and slight improvement in overall performance across subjects. Analysis on one subject who improved suggested that outliers were excluded from the robust covariance matrices estimation. These results revealed a promising direction of RFBCSP for robust classifications of EEG measurements in MI-BCI."
19963466,"This paper investigates the classification of multi-class motor imagery for electroencephalogram (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) using the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) algorithm. The FBCSP algorithm classifies EEG measurements from features constructed using subject-specific temporal-spatial filters. However, the FBCSP algorithm is limited to binary-class motor imagery. Hence, this paper proposes 3 approaches of multi-class extension to the FBCSP algorithm: One-versus-Rest, Pair-Wise and Divide-and-Conquer. These approaches decompose the multi-class problem into several binary-class problems. The study is conducted on the BCI Competition IV dataset IIa, which comprises single-trial EEG data from 9 subjects performing 4-class motor imagery of left-hand, right-hand, foot and tongue actions. The results showed that the multi-class FBCSP algorithm could extract features that matched neurophysiological knowledge, and yielded the best performance on the evaluation data compared to other international submissions."
19938302,"The apparently stable brain representation of our bodies is easily challenged. We have recently shown that the illusion of ownership of a three-dimensional virtual hand can be evoked through synchronous tactile stimulation of a person's hidden real hand and that of the virtual hand. This reproduces the well-known rubber-hand illusion, but in virtual reality. Here we show that some aspects of the illusion can also occur through motor imagery used to control movements of a virtual hand. When movements of the virtual hand followed motor imagery, the illusion of ownership of the virtual hand was evoked and muscle activity measured through electromyogram correlated with movements of the virtual arm. Using virtual bodies has a great potential in the fields of physical and neural rehabilitation, making the understanding of ownership of a virtual body highly relevant."
19789106,"This paper describes a method to recover task-related brain sources in the context of multiclass brain--computer interfaces (BCIs) based on noninvasive EEG. We extend the method joint approximate diagonalization (JAD) for spatial filtering using a maximum likelihood framework. This generic formulation: 1) bridges the gap between the common spatial patterns (CSPs) and blind source separation of nonstationary sources; and 2) leads to a neurophysiologically adapted version of JAD, accounting for the successive activations/deactivations of brain sources during motor imagery (MI) trials. Using dataset 2a of BCI Competition IV (2008) in which nine subjects were involved in a four-class two-session MI-based BCI experiment, a quantitative evaluation of our extension is provided by comparing its performance against JAD and CSP in the case of cross-validation, as well as session-to-session transfer. While JAD, as already proposed in other works, does not prove to be significantly better than classical one-versus-rest CSP, our extension is shown to perform significantly better than CSP for cross-validated and session-to-session performance. The extension of JAD introduced in this paper yields among the best session-to-session transfer results presented so far for this particular dataset; thus, it appears to be of great interest for real-life BCIs."
19781986,"To test whether human intentions to sustain or cease movements in right and left hands can be decoded reliably from spatially filtered single-trial magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals for motor execution and motor imagery. Seven healthy volunteers, naïve to BCI technology, participated in this study. Signals were recorded from 275-channel MEG, and synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) was employed as the spatial filter. The four-class classification was performed offline. Genetic algorithm based Mahalanobis linear distance (GA-MLD) and direct-decision tree classifier (DTC) techniques were adopted for the classification through 10-fold cross-validation. Through SAM imaging, strong and distinct event-related desynchronization (ERD) associated with sustaining, and event-related synchronization (ERS) patterns associated with ceasing of right and left hand movements were observed in the beta band (15-30Hz) on the contralateral hemispheres for motor execution and motor imagery sessions. Virtual channels were selected from these areas of high activity for the corresponding events as per the paradigm of the study. Through a statistical comparison between SAM-filtered virtual channels from single-trial MEG signals and basic MEG sensors, it was found that SAM-filtered virtual channels significantly increased the classification accuracy for motor execution (GA-MLD: 96.51+/-2.43%) as well as motor imagery sessions (GA-MLD: 89.69+/-3.34%). Multiple movement intentions can be reliably detected from SAM-based spatially filtered single-trial MEG signals. MEG signals associated with natural motor behavior may be utilized for a reliable high-performance brain-computer interface (BCI) and may reduce long-term training compared with conventional BCI methods using rhythm control."
19622442,"Current brain-computer interface (BCI) systems suffer from high complex feature selectors in comparison to simple classifiers. Meanwhile, neurophysiological and experimental information are hard to be included in these two separate phases. In this paper, based on the hierarchical observation model, we proposed an empirical Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA), in which the neurophysiological and experimental priors are considered simultaneously; the feature selection, weighted differently, and classification are performed jointly, thus it provides a novel systematic algorithm framework which can utilize priors related to feature and trial in the classifier design in a BCI. BLDA was comparatively evaluated by two simulations of a two-class and a four-class problem, and then it was applied to two real four-class motor imagery BCI datasets. The results confirmed that BLDA is superior in accuracy and robustness to LDA, regularized LDA, and SVM."

As MI tasks are subject-specific, selection of subject-specific discriminative frequency components play a vital role in distinguishing these patterns. This paper proposes a new discriminative filter bank (FB) common spatial pattern algorithm to extract subject-specific FB for MI classification. The proposed method enhances the classification accuracy in BCI competition III dataset IVa and competition IV dataset IIb. Compared to the performance offered by the existing FB-based method, the proposed algorithm offers error rate reductions of 17.42% and 8.9% for BCI competition datasets III and IV, respectively."
19575625,"The cognitive neural prosthetic (CNP) is a very versatile method for assisting paralyzed patients and patients with amputations. The CNP records the cognitive state of the subject, rather than signals strictly related to motor execution or sensation. We review a number of high-level cortical signals and their application for CNPs, including intention, motor imagery, decision making, forward estimation, executive function, attention, learning, and multi-effector movement planning. CNPs are defined by the cognitive function they extract, not the cortical region from which the signals are recorded. However, some cortical areas may be better than others for particular applications. Signals can also be extracted in parallel from multiple cortical areas using multiple implants, which in many circumstances can increase the range of applications of CNPs. The CNP approach relies on scientific understanding of the neural processes involved in cognition, and many of the decoding algorithms it uses also have parallels to underlying neural circuit functions."
19556679,"This study aims to explore whether human intentions to move or cease to move right and left hands can be decoded from spatiotemporal features in non-invasive EEG in order to control a discrete two-dimensional cursor movement for a potential multidimensional brain-computer interface (BCI). Five naïve subjects performed either sustaining or stopping a motor task with time locking to a predefined time window by using motor execution with physical movement or motor imagery. Spatial filtering, temporal filtering, feature selection and classification methods were explored. The performance of the proposed BCI was evaluated by both offline classification and online two-dimensional cursor control. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) and post-movement event-related synchronization (ERS) were observed on the contralateral hemisphere to the hand moved for both motor execution and motor imagery. Feature analysis showed that EEG beta band activity in the contralateral hemisphere over the motor cortex provided the best detection of either sustained or ceased movement of the right or left hand. The offline classification of four motor tasks (sustain or cease to move right or left hand) provided 10-fold cross-validation accuracy as high as 88% for motor execution and 73% for motor imagery. The subjects participating in experiments with physical movement were able to complete the online game with motor execution at an average accuracy of 85.5 +/- 4.65%; the subjects participating in motor imagery study also completed the game successfully. The proposed BCI provides a new practical multidimensional method by noninvasive EEG signal associated with human natural behavior, which does not need long-term training."
19545601,"An EEG-based brain-computer system can be used to control external devices such as computers, wheelchairs or Virtual Environments. One of the most important applications is a spelling device to aid severely disabled individuals with communication, for example people disabled by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). P300-based BCI systems are optimal for spelling characters with high speed and accuracy, as compared to other BCI paradigms such as motor imagery. In this study, 100 subjects tested a P300-based BCI system to spell a 5-character word with only 5 min of training. EEG data were acquired while the subject looked at a 36-character matrix to spell the word WATER. Two different versions of the P300 speller were used: (i) the row/column speller (RC) that flashes an entire column or row of characters and (ii) a single character speller (SC) that flashes each character individually. The subjects were free to decide which version to test. Nineteen subjects opted to test both versions. The BCI system classifier was trained on the data collected for the word WATER. During the real-time phase of the experiment, the subject spelled the word LUCAS, and was provided with the classifier selection accuracy after each of the five letters. Additionally, subjects filled out a questionnaire about age, sex, education, sleep duration, working duration, cigarette consumption, coffee consumption, and level of disturbance that the flashing characters produced. 72.8% (N=81) of the subjects were able to spell with 100% accuracy in the RC paradigm and 55.3% (N=38) of the subjects spelled with 100% accuracy in the SC paradigm. Less than 3% of the subjects did not spell any character correctly. People who slept less than 8h performed significantly better than other subjects. Sex, education, working duration, and cigarette and coffee consumption were not statistically related to differences in accuracy. The disturbance of the flashing characters was rated with a median score of 1 on a scale from 1 to 5 (1, not disturbing; 5, highly disturbing). This study shows that high spelling accuracy can be achieved with the P300 BCI system using approximately 5 min of training data for a large number of non-disabled subjects, and that the RC paradigm is superior to the SC paradigm. 89% of the 81 RC subjects were able to spell with accuracy 80-100%. A similar study using a motor imagery BCI with 99 subjects showed that only 19% of the subjects were able to achieve accuracy of 80-100%. These large differences in accuracy suggest that with limited amounts of training data the P300-based BCI is superior to the motor imagery BCI. Overall, these results are very encouraging and a similar study should be conducted with subjects who have ALS to determine if their accuracy levels are similar."
19493851,"This paper introduces a number of modifications to the learning algorithm of the self-organizing fuzzy neural network (SOFNN) to improve computational efficiency. It is shown that the modified SOFNN favorably compares to other evolving fuzzy systems in terms of accuracy and structural complexity. An analysis of the SOFNN's effectiveness when applied in an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) involving the neural-time-series-prediction-preprocessing (NTSPP) framework is also presented, where a sensitivity analysis (SA) of the SOFNN hyperparameters was performed using EEG data recorded from three subjects during left/right-motor-imagery-based BCI experiments. The aim of this one-time SA was to eliminate the need to choose subject- and signal-specific hyperparameters for the SOFNN and thus apply the SOFNN in the NTSPP framework as a parameterless self-organizing framework for EEG preprocessing. The results indicate that a general set of NTSPP parameters chosen via the SA provide the best results when tested in a BCI system. Therefore, with this general set of SOFNN parameters and its self-organizing structure, in conjunction with parameterless feature extraction and linear discriminant classification, a fully parameterless BCI that lends itself well to autonomous adaptation is realizable."
19487151,"Translation of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings into control signals for brain-computer interface (BCI) systems needs to be based on a robust classification of the various types of information. EEG-based BCI features are often noisy and likely to contain outliers. This contribution describes the application of a fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) with a radial basis function kernel for classifying motor imagery tasks, while the statistical features over the set of the wavelet coefficients were extracted to characterize the time-frequency distribution of EEG signals. In the proposed FSVM classifier, a low fraction of support vectors was used as a criterion for choosing the kernel parameter and the trade-off parameter, together with the membership parameter based solely on training data. FSVM and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers outperformed the winner of the BCI Competition 2003 and other similar studies on the same Graz dataset, in terms of the competition criterion of the mutual information (MI), while the FSVM classifier yielded a better performance than the SVM approach. FSVM and SVM classifiers perform much better than the winner of the BCI Competition 2005 on the same Graz dataset for the subject O3 according to the competition criterion of the maximal MI steepness, while the FSVM classifier outperforms the SVM method. The proposed FSVM model has potential in reducing the effects of noise or outliers in the online classification of EEG signals in BCIs."
19428521,"In the present study, we propose a neurofeedback-based motor imagery training system for EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI). The proposed system can help individuals get the feel of motor imagery by presenting them with real-time brain activation maps on their cortex. Ten healthy participants took part in our experiment, half of whom were trained by the suggested training system and the others did not use any training. All participants in the trained group succeeded in performing motor imagery after a series of trials to activate their motor cortex without any physical movements of their limbs. To confirm the effect of the suggested system, we recorded EEG signals for the trained group around sensorimotor cortex while they were imagining either left or right hand movements according to our experimental design, before and after the motor imagery training. For the control group, we also recorded EEG signals twice without any training sessions. The participants' intentions were then classified using a time-frequency analysis technique, and the results of the trained group showed significant differences in the sensorimotor rhythms between the signals recorded before and after training. Classification accuracy was also enhanced considerably in all participants after motor imagery training, compared to the accuracy before training. On the other hand, the analysis results for the control EEG data set did not show consistent increment in both the number of meaningful time-frequency combinations and the classification accuracy, demonstrating that the suggested system can be used as a tool for training motor imagery tasks in BCI applications. Further, we expect that the motor imagery training system will be useful not only for BCI applications, but for functional brain mapping studies that utilize motor imagery tasks as well."
19428515,"Research on brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is gaining strong interest. This is motivated by BCIs being applicable for helping disabled, for gaming, and as a tool in cognitive neuroscience. Often, motor imagery is used to produce (binary) control signals. However, finding other types of control signals that allow the discrimination of multiple classes would help to increase the applicability of BCIs. We have investigated if modulation of posterior alpha activity by means of covert spatial attention in two dimensions can be reliably classified in single trials. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data were collected for 15 subjects who were engaged in a task where they covertly had to visually attend left, right, up or down during a period of 2500 ms. We then classified the trials using support vector machines. The four orientations of covert attention could be reliably classified up to a maximum of 69% correctly classified trials (25% chance level) without the need for lengthy and burdensome subject training. Low classification performance in some subjects was explained by a low alpha signal. These findings support the case that modulation of alpha activity by means of covert spatial attention is promising as a control signal for a two-dimensional BCI."
19423426,"Spatial filtering (SF) constitutes an integral part of building EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Algorithms frequently used for SF, such as common spatial patterns (CSPs) and independent component analysis, require labeled training data for identifying filters that provide information on a subject's intention, which renders these algorithms susceptible to overfitting on artifactual EEG components. In this study, beamforming is employed to construct spatial filters that extract EEG sources originating within predefined regions of interest within the brain. In this way, neurophysiological knowledge on which brain regions are relevant for a certain experimental paradigm can be utilized to construct unsupervised spatial filters that are robust against artifactual EEG components. Beamforming is experimentally compared with CSP and Laplacian spatial filtering (LP) in a two-class motor-imagery paradigm. It is demonstrated that beamforming outperforms CSP and LP on noisy datasets, while CSP and beamforming perform almost equally well on datasets with few artifactual trials. It is concluded that beamforming constitutes an alternative method for SF that might be particularly useful for BCIs used in clinical settings, i.e., in an environment where artifact-free datasets are difficult to obtain."
19421415,"EEG-based discrimination between different motor imagery states has been subject of a number of studies in healthy subjects. We investigated the EEG of 15 patients with complete spinal cord injury during imagined right hand, left hand, and feet movements. In detail we studied pair-wise discrimination functions between the 3 types of motor imagery. The following classification accuracies (mean +/- SD) were obtained: left versus right hand 65.03% +/- 8.52, left hand versus feet 68.19% +/- 11.08, and right hand versus feet 65.05% +/- 9.25. In 5 out of 8 paralegic patients, the discrimination accuracy was greater than 70% but in only 1 out of 7 tetraplagic patients. The present findings provide evidence that in the majority of paraplegic patients an EEG-based BCI could achieve satisfied results. In tetraplegic patients, however, it is expected that extensive training-sessions are necessary to achieve a good BCI performance at least in some subjects."
19419576,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) use electroencephalography (EEG) to interpret user intention and control an output device accordingly. We describe a novel BCI method to use a signal from five EEG channels (comprising one primary channel with four additional channels used to calculate its Laplacian derivation) to provide two-dimensional (2-D) control of a cursor on a computer screen, with simple threshold-based binary classification of band power readings taken over pre-defined time windows during subject hand movement. We tested the paradigm with four healthy subjects, none of whom had prior BCI experience. Each subject played a game wherein he or she attempted to move a cursor to a target within a grid while avoiding a trap. We also present supplementary results including one healthy subject using motor imagery, one primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) patient, and one healthy subject using a single EEG channel without Laplacian derivation. For the four healthy subjects using real hand movement, the system provided accurate cursor control with little or no required user training. The average accuracy of the cursor movement was 86.1% (SD 9.8%), which is significantly better than chance (p = 0.0015). The best subject achieved a control accuracy of 96%, with only one incorrect bit classification out of 47. The supplementary results showed that control can be achieved under the respective experimental conditions, but with reduced accuracy. The binary method provides naïve subjects with real-time control of a cursor in 2-D using dichotomous classification of synchronous EEG band power readings from a small number of channels during hand movement. The primary strengths of our method are simplicity of hardware and software, and high accuracy when used by untrained subjects."
19412982,"The objective of this study is to classify spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) signal on the basis of fractal concepts. Four motor imagery tasks (left hand movement, right hand movement, feet movement, and tongue movement) were investigated for each EEG recording session. Ten subjects volunteered to participate in this study. As we known, fractal geometry is a mathematical tool for dealing with complex systems like EEG signal. Therefore, we used the fractal dimension (FD) as feature for the application of brain-machine interface (BMI). Effective algorithm, namely, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) has been selected to estimate embedded FD values between relaxing and imaging states of the recorded EEG signal. To show the pattern of FDs, we propose a windowing-based method or also called time-dependent fractal dimension (TDFD) and the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence. The K-L divergence and different expected values are employed as the input parameters of classifier. Finally, featured data are classified by a three-layer feed-forward neural network based on a simple backpropagation algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method is more effective than the conventional methods."
19225819,"Due to the non-stationarity of EEG signals, online training and adaptation are essential to EEG based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Self-paced BCIs offer more natural human-machine interaction than synchronous BCIs, but it is a great challenge to train and adapt a self-paced BCI online because the user's control intention and timing are usually unknown. This paper proposes a novel motor imagery based self-paced BCI paradigm for controlling a simulated robot in a specifically designed environment which is able to provide user's control intention and timing during online experiments, so that online training and adaptation of the motor imagery based self-paced BCI can be effectively investigated. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed paradigm with an extended Kalman filter based method to adapt the BCI classifier parameters, with experimental results of online self-paced BCI training with four subjects."
19163711,"Novel model based features are introduced in the discrimination of motor imagery tasks using human scalp electroencephalography (EEG) towards the development of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). We have acquired human scalp EEG under open-loop and feedback conditions in response to cue-based motor imagery tasks. EEG signals, transformed into frequency specific bands such as mu, beta and movement related potentials, were used for feature extraction with the aim to discriminate tasks. Data were classified using features such as power spectrum and model-based parameters. Two different feature selection methods: stepwise and principal component analysis (PCA), were combined with linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Different training/validation criteria were applied for classification of task related features. Results show that the scalp EEG correlate of the imagery tasks of hands/toes/tongue movements under open-loop conditions and left/right hand movements under feedback conditions, can be well discriminated with classification errors below 20%. Model based techniques, which resulted in classification errors in the range of 2%-30%, have the potential to use advanced control systems theory in the development of BCI to achieve improved performance compared to the performance achieved by currently applied proportional control or filter algorithms."
19163649,"The practical applicability of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology is limited due to its insufficient reliability and robustness. One of the major problems in this regard is the extensive variability and inconsistency of brain signal patterns, observed especially in electroencephalogram (EEG). This paper presents a fuzzy logic (FL) approach to the problem of handling of the resultant uncertainty effects. In particular, it outlines the design of a novel type-2 FL system (T2FLS) classifier within the framework of an EEG-based BCI, and examines its on-line applicability in the presence of shortand long-term nonstationarities of spectral EEG correlates of motor imagery (imagination of left vs. right hand movement). The developed system is shown to effectively cope with real-time constraints. In addition, a comparative post hoc analysis has revealed that the proposed T2FLS classifier outperforms conventional BCI methods, like LDA and SVM, in terms of the maximum classification accuracy (CA) rates by a relatively small, yet statistically significant, margin."
19163633,"This clinical study investigates whether the performance of hemiparetic stroke patients operating a non-invasive Motor Imagery-based Brain-Computer Interface (MI-BCI) is comparable to healthy subjects. The study is performed on 8 healthy subjects and 35 BCI-naïve hemiparetic stroke patients. This study also investigates whether the performance of the stroke patients in operating MI-BCI correlates with the extent of neurological disability. The performance is objectively computed from the 10 x 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of employing the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) algorithm on their EEG measurements. The neurological disability is subjectively estimated using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) of the upper extremity. The results show that the performance of BCI-naïve hemiparetic stroke patients is comparable to healthy subjects, and no correlation is found between the accuracy of their performance and their motor impairment in terms of FMA."
19163632,"This clinical study investigates whether the spatial patterns of hemiparetic stroke patients operating a non-invasive Motor Imagery-based Brain Computer Interface (MI-BCI) is comparable to healthy subjects. The spatial patterns for a specific frequency range are generated using the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm, of which is highly successful for discriminating two classes of EEG measurements in MI-BCI. The spatial patterns illustrate how the presumed sources project on the scalp and are effective in verifying the neurophysiological plausibility of the computed solution. The spatial patterns show focused activity in ipsilateral as well as contralateral hemisphere with respect to the hand by tapping or motor imagery in 2 BCI-artful healthy subjects and 12 BCI-naïve hemiparetic stroke patients. The results also show that neurophysiologically interpretable spatial patterns is more common in performing motor imagery compared to finger tapping by hemiparetic stroke patients. Hence, this shows that hemiparetic stroke patients are capable of operating MI-BCI."
19163552,"A motor based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) translates the subject's motor intention into a control signal by means of the method which extracts characteristic feature from EEG recorded from the scalp. In this paper, the EEG signal recorded during three motor imagery tasks, which were imagination of left hand, right hand and foot movements, was investigated. A novel method named Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is introduced to extract the feature from signal. Firstly, raw signal is decomposed using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). And then, several Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) are gained. For further study, the IMFs whose main frequency is higher than 5 Hz are selected. Secondly, based on the IMFs selected above, Hilbert spectrum is calculated. In each motor imagery task, local instantaneous energies, within specific frequency band of electrode C3 and C4, are selected as the features. A three-layer BP Neural Network classifier is structured for pattern classification. The classification results show that HHT can be used in EEG-based BCI research as a method to analysis non-linear and non-stationary signal."
19162856,"Brain Computer Interface (BCI) provides an alternative communication and control method for people with severe motor disabilities. Motor imagery patterns are widely used in Electroencephalogram (EEG) based BCIs. These motor imagery activities are associated with variation in alpha and beta band power of EEG signals called Event Related Desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS). The dominant frequency bands are subject-specific and therefore performance of motor imagery based BCIs are sensitive to both temporal filtering and spatial filtering. As the optimum filter is strongly subject-dependent, we propose a method that selects the subject-specific discriminative frequency components using time-frequency plots of Fisher ratio of two-class motor imagery patterns. We also propose a low complexity adaptive Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter bank system based on coefficient decimation technique which can realize the subject-specific bandpass filters adaptively depending on the information of Fisher ratio map. Features are extracted only from the selected frequency components. The proposed adaptive filter bank based system offers average classification accuracy of about 90%, which is slightly better than the existing fixed filter bank system."
19162832,"In motor imagery based BCI, the alpha rhythm shares the same frequency band with sensorimotor rhythm (SMR), and does not correlate with mental task, which contaminates the SMR recording. Independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to decompose original EEG signal into source components, and a comprehensive method was proposed to discriminate those source components by combining temporal, frequency, spatial, and class label information. Task-irrelevant alpha components were sorted out and their projections were reduced by proper bipolar electrode placement for improving the BCI performance."
19162828,"This paper investigates the classification of voluntary facial expressions from electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals using the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) algorithm. The FBCSP algorithm is an autonomous and effective machine learning approach for classifying two classes of EEG measurements in motor imagery-based Brain Computer Interface (BCI). However, the problem of facial expression recognition typically involves more than just two classes of measurements. Hence, this paper proposes an extension of FBCSP to the multiclass paradigm using a decision threshold-based classifier for classifying facial expressions from EEG and EMG measurements. A study is conducted using the proposed Multiclass FBCSP on 4 subjects who performed 6 different facial expressions. The results show that the Multiclass FBCSP is effective in classifying multiple facial expressions from the EEG and EMG measurements."
19162827,"We present a new method for the classification of EEG in a brain computer interface by adapting subject specific features in spectral, temporal and spatial domain. For this particular purpose we extend our previous work on ECoG classification based on structural feature dictionary and apply it to extract the spectro-temporal patterns of multichannel EEG recordings related to a motor imagery task. The construction of the feature dictionary based on undecimated wavelet packet transform is extended to block FFT. We evaluate several subset selection algorithms to select a small number of features for final classification. We tested our proposed approach on five subjects of BCI Competition 2005 dataset- IVa. By adapting the wavelet filter for each subject, the algorithm achieved an average classification accuracy of 91.4% The classification results and characteristic of selected features indicate that the proposed algorithm can jointly adapt to EEG patterns in spectro-spatio-temporal domain and provide classification accuracies as good as existing methods used in the literature."
19162742,"Cognitive tasks using motor imagery have been used for generating and controlling EEG activity in most brain-computer interface (BCI). Nevertheless, during the performance of a particular mental task, different factors such as concentration, attention, level of consciousness and the difficulty of the task, may be affecting the changes in the EEG activity. Accordingly, training the subject to consistently and reliably produce and control the changes in the EEG signals is a critical issue in developing a BCI system. In this work, we used meditation practice to enhance the mind controllability during the performance of a mental task in a BCI system. The mental states to be discriminated are the imaginative hand movement and the idle state. The experiments were conducted on two groups of subject, meditation group and control group. The time-frequency analysis of EEG signals for meditation practitioners showed an event-related desynchronization (ERD) of beta rhythm before imagination during resting state. In addition, a strong event-related synchronization (ERS) of beta rhythm was induced in frequency around 25 Hz during hand motor imagery. The results demonstrated that the meditation practice can improve the classification accuracy of EEG patterns. The average classification accuracy was 88.73% in the meditation group, while it was 70.28% in the control group. An accuracy as high as 98.0% was achieved in the meditation group."
19162735,"EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) can be regarded as a new channel for motor control except that it does not involve muscles. Normal neuromuscular motor control has two fundamental components: (1) to control the body, and (2) to predict the consequences of the control command, which is called motor prediction. In this study, after training with a specially designed BCI paradigm based on motor imagery, two subjects learnt to predict the time course of some features of the EEG signals. It is shown that, with this newly-obtained motor prediction skill, subjects can use motor imagery of feet to directly control a mobile robot to avoid obstacles and reach a small target in a time-critical scenario."
19162733,"The classification performance of a brain-computer interface (BCI) depends largely on the methods of data recording and feature extraction. The electrocorticogram (ECoG)-based BCIs are a BCI modality that has the potential to achieve high classification accuracy. This paper proposes a new algorithm for classifying single-trial ECoG during motor imagery. The optimal channel subsets are first selected by genetic algorithms from multi-channel ECoG recordings, then the power features are extracted by common spatial pattern (CSP), and finally Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) is used for classification. The algorithm is applied to Data set I of BCI Competition III and the classification accuracy of 90% is achieved on test set by using only seven channels."
19162732,"In this paper, alpha band modulation during visual spatial attention without visual stimuli was focused. Visual spatial attention has been expected to provide a new channel of non-invasive independent brain computer interface (BCI), but little work has been done on the new interfacing method. The flickering stimuli used in previous work cause a decline of independency and have difficulties in a practical use. Therefore we investigated whether visual spatial attention could be detected without such stimuli. Further, the common spatial patterns (CSP) were for the first time applied to the brain states during visual spatial attention. The performance evaluation was based on three brain states of left, right and center direction attention. The 30-channel scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) signals over occipital cortex were recorded for five subjects. Without CSP, the analyses made 66.44 (range 55.42 to 72.27) % of average classification performance in discriminating left and right attention classes. With CSP, the averaged classification accuracy was 75.39 (range 63.75 to 86.13) %. It is suggested that CSP is useful in the context of visual spatial attention, and the alpha band modulation during visual spatial attention without flickering stimuli has the possibility of a new channel for independent BCI as well as motor imagery."
19121977,"This study investigates the impact of a continuously presented visual feedback in the form of a grasping hand on the modulation of sensorimotor EEG rhythms during online control of a brain-computer interface (BCI). Two groups of participants were trained to use left or right hand motor imagery to control a specific output signal on a computer monitor: the experimental group controlled a moving hand performing an object-related grasp ('realistic feedback'), whereas the control group controlled a moving bar ('abstract feedback'). Continuous feedback was realized by using the outcome of a real-time classifier which was based on EEG signals recorded from left and right central sites. The classification results show no difference between the two feedback groups. For both groups, ERD/ERS analysis revealed a significant larger ERD during feedback presentation compared to an initial motor imagery screening session without feedback. Increased ERD during online BCI control was particularly found for the lower alpha (8-10 Hz) and for the beta bands (16-20, 20-24 Hz). The present study demonstrates that visual BCI feedback clearly modulates sensorimotor EEG rhythms. When the feedback provides equivalent information on both the continuous and final outcomes of mental actions, the presentation form (abstract versus realistic) does not influence the performance in a BCI, at least in initial training sessions. The present results are of practical interest for classifier development and BCI use in the field of motor restoration."
19084556,"The study presented in this paper shows that electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals can be classified for making use of a human brain-computer interface (BCI) field. The results show that certain invariant phase transition features can be reliably used to classify two types of imagined movements accurately. Those are the left small-finger and tongue movements. Our approach consists of two main parts: channel selection based on Tsallis entropy in Hilbert domain and the nonlinear classification of motor imagery with support vector machines (SVMs). The new approach, based on Hilbert and statistical/entropy measurements, were combined with SVMs based on admissible kernels for classification purposes. The classification accuracy rates were 95% (264/278) and 73% (73/100) for training and testing sets, respectively. The results support the use of classification methods for ECoG-based BCIs."
19028138,"Performing foot motor imagery is accompanied by a peri-imagery ERD and a post-imagery beta ERS (beta rebound). Our aim was to study whether the post-imagery beta rebound is a suitable feature for a simple ""brain switch"". Such a brain switch is a specifically designed brain-computer interface (BCI) with the aim to detect only one predefined brain state (e.g. EEG pattern) in ongoing brain activity. One EEG (Laplacian) recorded at the vertex during cue-based brisk foot motor imagery was analysed in 5 healthy subjects. The peri-imagery ERD and the post-imagery beta rebound (ERS) were analysed in detail between 6 and 40Hz and classified with two support vector machines. The ERD was detected in ongoing EEG (simulation of asynchronous BCI) with a true positive rate (TPR) of 28.4%+/-13.5 and the beta rebound with a TPR of 59.2%+/-20.3. In single runs with 30 cues each, the TPR for beta rebound detection was 78.6%+/-12.8. The false positive rate was always kept below 10%. The findings suggest that the beta rebound at Cz during foot motor imagery is a relatively stable and reproducible phenomenon detectable in single EEG trials. Our results indicate that the beta rebound is a suitable feature to realize a ""brain switch"" with one single EEG (Laplacian) channel only."
19026717,"Real-time functional MRI (rtfMRI) has been used as a basis for brain-computer interface (BCI) due to its ability to characterize region-specific brain activity in real-time. As an extension of BCI, we present an rtfMRI-based brain-machine interface (BMI) whereby 2-dimensional movement of a robotic arm was controlled by the regulation (and concurrent detection) of regional cortical activations in the primary motor areas. To do so, the subjects were engaged in the right- and/or left-hand motor imagery tasks. The blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal originating from the corresponding hand motor areas was then translated into horizontal or vertical robotic arm movement. The movement was broadcasted visually back to the subject as a feedback. We demonstrated that real-time control of the robotic arm only through the subjects' thought processes was possible using the rtfMRI-based BMI trials."
18990646,"It is of wide interest to study the brain activity that correlates to the control of brain-computer interface (BCI). In the present study, we have developed an approach to image the cortical rhythmic modulation associated with motor imagery using minimum-norm estimates in the frequency domain (MNEFD). The distribution of cortical sources of mu activity during online control of BCI was obtained with the MNEFD. Contralateral decrease (event-related desynchronization) and ipsilateral increase (event-related synchronization) are localized in the sensorimotor cortex during online control of BCI in a group of human subjects. Statistical source analysis revealed that maximum correlation with movement imagination is localized in sensorimotor cortex."
18973568,"Multi-channel electroencephalography recordings have shown that a visual cue, indicating right hand, left hand or foot motor imagery, can induce a short-lived brain state in the order of about 500 ms. In the present study, 10 able-bodied subjects without any motor imagery experience (naive subjects) were asked to imagine the indicated limb movement for some seconds. Common spatial filtering and linear single-trial classification was applied to discriminate between two conditions (two brain states: right hand vs. left hand, left hand vs. foot and right hand vs. foot). The corresponding classification accuracies (mean +/- SD) were 80.0 +/- 10.6%, 83.3 +/- 10.2% and 83.6 +/- 8.8%, respectively. Inspection of central mu and beta rhythms revealed a short-lasting somatotopically specific event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the upper mu and/or beta bands starting approximately 300 ms after the cue onset and lasting for less than 1 s."
18848844,"In this study, an electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis system for single-trial classification of motor imagery (MI) data is proposed. Feature extraction in brain-computer interface (BCI) work is an important task that significantly affects the success of brain signal classification. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is applied together with Student's two-sample t-statistics for 2D time-scale feature extraction, where features are extracted from EEG signals recorded from subjects performing left and right MI. First, we utilize the CWT to construct a 2D time-scale feature, which yields a highly redundant representation of EEG signals in the time-frequency domain, from which we can obtain precise localization of event-related brain desynchronization and synchronization (ERD and ERS) components. We then weight the 2D time-scale feature with Student's two-sample t-statistics, representing a time-scale plot of discriminant information between left and right MI. These important characteristics, including precise localization and significant discriminative ability, substantially enhance the classification of mental tasks. Finally, a correlation coefficient is used to classify the MI data. Due to its simplicity, it will enable the performance of our proposed method to be clearly demonstrated. Compared to a conventional 2D time-frequency feature and three well-known time-frequency approaches, the experimental results show that the proposed method provides reliable 2D time-scale features for BCI classification."
18845473,"To use the neural signals preceding movement and motor imagery to predict which of the four movements/motor imageries is about to occur, and to access this utility for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Eight naïve subjects performed or kinesthetically imagined four movements while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 29 channels over sensorimotor areas. The task was instructed with a specific stimulus (S1) and performed at a second stimulus (S2). A classifier was trained and tested offline at differentiating the EEG signals from movement/imagery preparation (the 1.5-s preceding movement/imagery execution). Accuracy of movement/imagery preparation classification varied between subjects. The system preferentially selected event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) signals for classification, and high accuracies were associated with classifications that relied heavily on the ERD/ERS to discriminate movement/imagery planning. The ERD/ERS preceding movement and motor imagery can be used to predict which of the four movements/imageries is about to occur. Prediction accuracy depends on this signal's accessibility. The ERD/ERS is the most specific pre-movement/imagery signal to the movement/imagery about to be performed."
18756030,"A motor imagery based brain-computer interface (BCI) provides a non-muscular communication channel that enables people with paralysis to control external devices using their motor imagination. Reducing the number of electrodes is critical to improving the portability and practicability of the BCI system. A novel method is proposed to reduce the number of electrodes to a total of four by finding the optimal positions of two bipolar electrodes. Independent component analysis (ICA) is applied to find the source components of mu and alpha rhythms, and optimal electrodes are chosen by comparing the projection weights of sources on each channel. The results of eight subjects demonstrate the better classification performance of the optimal layout compared with traditional layouts, and the stability of this optimal layout over a one week interval was further verified."
18714838,"In most current motor-imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), machine learning is carried out in two consecutive stages: feature extraction and feature classification. Feature extraction has focused on automatic learning of spatial filters, with little or no attention being paid to optimization of parameters for temporal filters that still require time-consuming, ad hoc manual tuning. In this paper, we present a new algorithm termed iterative spatio-spectral patterns learning (ISSPL) that employs statistical learning theory to perform automatic learning of spatio-spectral filters. In ISSPL, spectral filters and the classifier are simultaneously parameterized for optimization to achieve good generalization performance. A detailed derivation and theoretical analysis of ISSPL are given. Experimental results on two datasets show that the proposed algorithm can correctly identify the discriminative frequency bands, demonstrating the algorithm's superiority over contemporary approaches in classification performance."
18701380,"The quantification of the spectral content of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings has a substantial role in clinical and scientific applications. It is of particular relevance in the analysis of event-related brain oscillatory responses. This work is focused on the identification and quantification of relevant frequency patterns in motor imagery (MI) related EEGs utilized for brain-computer interface (BCI) purposes. The main objective of the paper is to perform comparative analysis of different approaches to spectral signal representation such as power spectral density (PSD) techniques, atomic decompositions, time-frequency (t-f) energy distributions, continuous and discrete wavelet approaches, from which band power features can be extracted and used in the framework of MI classification. The emphasis is on identifying discriminative properties of the feature sets representing EEG trials recorded during imagination of either left- or right-hand movement. Feature separability is quantified in the offline study using the classification accuracy (CA) rate obtained with linear and nonlinear classifiers. PSD approaches demonstrate the most consistent robustness and effectiveness in extracting the distinctive spectral patterns for accurately discriminating between left and right MI induced EEGs. This observation is based on an analysis of data recorded from eleven subjects over two sessions of BCI experiments. In addition, generalization capabilities of the classifiers reflected in their intersession performance are discussed in the paper."
18671209,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) is based on the analysis of the electroencephalographic (EEG) signals recorded during certain mental activities, to control an external device. Main users are people with severe neuromuscular disorders, like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. One of the most important problems to control a BCI is the need of providing suitable training, helping subjects to get some control of the EEG signals. To carry out a study of possible effects of the use of specific mental tasks during the first phase of the training period. Eighteen healthy untrained subjects took part in the experiment. A group of subjects were trained to discriminate between two motor imagery tasks (imagination of right and left hand movements). Another group were trained to discriminate between a motor imagery task (imagination of right hand movements) and mental relaxation. Objective and subjective measures based on questionnaires were taken. Some subjects do not achieved EEG control, but subjects at the second group showed a greater facility to control a BCI. Training protocols should not be randomly chosen; they must be adapted to the subject to be effective. Sometimes it is necessary to increase the number of sessions without feedback before submitting a subject to a session with feedback, and a correct choice of the mental tasks is very important. Mental tasks which are easy to discriminate improve classification result and produce better satisfaction to the subject."
18656500,"Features extracted with optimized wavelets were compared with standard methods for a Brain-Computer Interface driven by non-motor imagery tasks. Two non-motor imagery tasks were used, Auditory Imagery of a familiar tune and Spatial Navigation Imagery through a familiar environment. The aims of this study were to evaluate which method extracts features that could be best differentiated and determine which channels are best suited for classification. EEG activity from 18 electrodes over the temporal and parietal lobes of nineteen healthy subjects was recorded. The features used were autoregressive and reflection coefficients extracted using autoregressive modeling with several model orders and marginals of the wavelet spaces generated by the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An optimization algorithm with 4 and 6 taps filters and mother wavelets from the Daubechies family were used. The classification was performed for each single channel and for all possible combination of two channels using a Bayesian Classifier. The best classification results were found using the marginals of the Optimized DWT spaces for filters with 6 taps in a 2 channels classification basis. Classification using 2 channels was found to be significantly better than using 1 channel (p<<0.01). The marginals of the optimized DWT using 6 taps filters showed to be significantly better than the marginals of the Daubechies family and autoregressive coefficients. The influence of the combination of number of channels and feature extraction method over the classification results was not significant (p=0.97)."
18592230,"Although several features of brain motor function appear to be preserved even in chronic complete SCI, previous functional MRI (fMRI) studies have also identified significant derangements such as a strongly reduced volume of activation, a poor modulation of function and abnormal activation patterns. It might be speculated that extensive motor imagery training may serve to prevent such abnormalities. We here report on a unique patient with a complete traumatic SCI below C5 who learned to elicit electroencephalographic signals beta-bursts in the midline region upon imagination of foot movements. This enabled him to use a neuroprosthesis and to ""walk from thought"" in a virtual environment via a brain-computer interface (BCI). We here used fMRI at 3T during imagined hand and foot movements to investigate the effects of motor imagery via persistent BCI training over 8 years on brain motor function and compared these findings to a group of five untrained healthy age-matched volunteers during executed and imagined movements. We observed robust primary sensorimotor cortex (SMC) activity in expected somatotopy in the tetraplegic patient upon movement imagination while such activation was absent in healthy untrained controls. Sensorimotor network activation with motor imagery in the patient (including SMC contralateral to and the cerebellum ipsilateral to the imagined side of movement as well as supplementary motor areas) was very similar to the pattern observed with actual movement in the controls. We interpret our findings as evidence that BCI training as a conduit of motor imagery training may assist in maintaining access to SMC in largely preserved somatopy despite complete deafferentation."
18584040,"A novel 4-class single-trial brain computer interface (BCI) based on two (rather than four or more) binary linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers is proposed, which is called a ""parallel BCI."" Unlike other BCIs where mental tasks are executed and classified in a serial way one after another, the parallel BCI uses properly designed parallel mental tasks that are executed on both sides of the subject body simultaneously, which is the main novelty of the BCI paradigm used in our experiments. Each of the two binary classifiers only classifies the mental tasks executed on one side of the subject body, and the results of the two binary classifiers are combined to give the result of the 4-class BCI. Data was recorded in experiments with both real movement and motor imagery in 3 able-bodied subjects. Artifacts were not detected or removed. Offline analysis has shown that, in some subjects, the parallel BCI can generate a higher accuracy than a conventional 4-class BCI, although both of them have used the same feature selection and classification algorithms."
18495541,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can be used for communication in writing without muscular activity or for learning to control seizures by voluntary regulation of brain signals such as the electroencephalogram (EEG). Three of five patients with epilepsy were able to spell their names with electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals derived from motor-related areas within only one or two training sessions. Imagery of finger or tongue movements was classified with support-vector classification of autoregressive coefficients derived from the ECoG signals. After training of the classifier, binary classification responses were used to select letters from a computer-generated menu. Offline analysis showed increased theta activity in the unsuccessful patients, whereas the successful patients exhibited dominant sensorimotor rhythms that they could control. The high spatial resolution and increased signal-to-noise ratio in ECoG signals, combined with short training periods, may offer an alternative for communication in complete paralysis, locked-in syndrome, and motor restoration."
18403288,"For persons with severe disabilities, a brain-computer interface (BCI) may be a viable means of communication. Lapalacian electroencephalogram (EEG) has been shown to improve classification in EEG recognition. In this work, the effectiveness of signals from tripolar concentric electrodes and disc electrodes were compared for use as a BCI. Two sets of left/right hand motor imagery EEG signals were acquired. An autoregressive (AR) model was developed for feature extraction with a Mahalanobis distance based linear classifier for classification. An exhaust selection algorithm was employed to analyze three factors before feature extraction. The factors analyzed were 1) length of data in each trial to be used, 2) start position of data, and 3) the order of the AR model. The results showed that tripolar concentric electrodes generated significantly higher classification accuracy than disc electrodes."
18354735,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems create a novel communication channel from the brain to an output device bypassing conventional motor output pathways of nerves and muscles. Modern BCI technology is essentially based on techniques for the classification of single-trial brain signals. With respect to the topographic patterns of brain rhythm modulations, the common spatial patterns (CSPs) algorithm has been proven to be very useful to produce subject-specific and discriminative spatial filters; but it didn't consider temporal structures of event-related potentials which may be very important for single-trial EEG classification. In this paper, we propose a new framework of feature extraction for classification of hand movement imagery EEG. Computer simulations on real experimental data indicate that independent residual analysis (IRA) method can provide efficient temporal features. Combining IRA features with the CSP method, we obtain the optimal spatial and temporal features with which we achieve the best classification rate. The high classification rate indicates that the proposed method is promising for an EEG-based brain-computer interface."
18350133,"We present the self-paced 3-class Graz brain-computer interface (BCI) which is based on the detection of sensorimotor electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythms induced by motor imagery. Self-paced operation means that the BCI is able to determine whether the ongoing brain activity is intended as control signal (intentional control) or not (non-control state). The presented system is able to automatically reduce electrooculogram (EOG) artifacts, to detect electromyographic (EMG) activity, and uses only three bipolar EEG channels. Two applications are presented: the freeSpace virtual environment (VE) and the Brainloop interface. The freeSpace is a computer-game-like application where subjects have to navigate through the environment and collect coins by autonomously selecting navigation commands. Three subjects participated in these feedback experiments and each learned to navigate through the VE and collect coins. Two out of the three succeeded in collecting all three coins. The Brainloop interface provides an interface between the Graz-BCI and Google Earth."
18310808,"To explore the reliability of a high performance brain-computer interface (BCI) using non-invasive EEG signals associated with human natural motor behavior does not require extensive training. We propose a new BCI method, where users perform either sustaining or stopping a motor task with time locking to a predefined time window. Nine healthy volunteers, one stroke survivor with right-sided hemiparesis and one patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) participated in this study. Subjects did not receive BCI training before participating in this study. We investigated tasks of both physical movement and motor imagery. The surface Laplacian derivation was used for enhancing EEG spatial resolution. A model-free threshold setting method was used for the classification of motor intentions. The performance of the proposed BCI was validated by an online sequential binary-cursor-control game for two-dimensional cursor movement. Event-related desynchronization and synchronization were observed when subjects sustained or stopped either motor execution or motor imagery. Feature analysis showed that EEG beta band activity over sensorimotor area provided the largest discrimination. With simple model-free classification of beta band EEG activity from a single electrode (with surface Laplacian derivation), the online classifications of the EEG activity with motor execution/motor imagery were: >90%/ approximately 80% for six healthy volunteers, >80%/ approximately 80% for the stroke patient and approximately 90%/ approximately 80% for the ALS patient. The EEG activities of the other three healthy volunteers were not classifiable. The sensorimotor beta rhythm of EEG associated with human natural motor behavior can be used for a reliable and high performance BCI for both healthy subjects and patients with neurological disorders. The proposed new non-invasive BCI method highlights a practical BCI for clinical applications, where the user does not require extensive training."
18274604,"For a robust brain-computer interface (BCI) system based on motor imagery (MI), it should be able to tell when the subject is not concentrating on MI tasks (the ""idle state"") so that real MI tasks could be extracted accurately. Moreover, because of the diversity of idle state, detecting idle state without training samples is as important as classifying MI tasks. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for solving this problem. A three-class classifier was constructed by combining two two-class classifiers, one specified for idle-state detection and the other for these two MI tasks. Common spatial subspace decomposition (CSSD) was used to extract the features of event-related desynchronization (ERD) in two motor imagery tasks. Then Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) was employed in the design of two two-class classifiers for completion of detecting each task, respectively. The algorithm successfully provided a way to solve the problem of ""idle-state detection without training samples."" The algorithm was applied to the dataset IVc from BCI competition III. A final result with mean square error of 0.30 was obtained on the testing set. This is the winning algorithm in BCI competition III. In addition, the algorithm was also validated by applying to the EEG data of an MI experiment including ""idle"" task."
18270004,"The self-paced control paradigm enables users to operate brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in a more natural way: no longer is the machine in control of the timing and speed of communication, but rather the user is. This is important to enhance the usability, flexibility, and response time of a BCI. In this work, we show how subjects, after performing cue-based feedback training (smiley paradigm), learned to navigate self-paced through the ""freeSpace"" virtual environment (VE). Similar to computer games, subjects had the task of picking up items by using the following navigation commands: rotate left, rotate right, and move forward ( three classes). Since the self-paced control paradigm allows subjects to make voluntary decisions on time, type, and duration of mental activity, no cues or routing directives were presented. The BCI was based only on three bipolar electroencephalogram channels and operated by motor imagery. Eye movements (electrooculogram) and electromyographic artifacts were reduced and detected online. The results of three able-bodied subjects are reported and problems emerging from self-paced control are discussed."
18198704,"The step away from a synchronized or cue-based brain-computer interface (BCI) and from laboratory conditions towards real world applications is very important and crucial in BCI research. This work shows that ten naive subjects can be trained in a synchronous paradigm within three sessions to navigate freely through a virtual apartment, whereby at every junction the subjects could decide by their own, how they wanted to explore the virtual environment (VE). This virtual apartment was designed similar to a real world application, with a goal-oriented task, a high mental workload, and a variable decision period for the subject. All subjects were able to perform long and stable motor imagery over a minimum time of 2 s. Using only three electroencephalogram (EEG) channels to analyze these imaginations, we were able to convert them into navigation commands. Additionally, it could be demonstrated that motivation is a very crucial factor in BCI research; motivated subjects perform much better than unmotivated ones."
18187220,A tetraplegic patient was able to induce midcentral localized beta oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) after extensive mental practice of foot motor imagery. This beta oscillation was used to simulate a wheel chair movement in a virtual environment (VE). The analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) data revealed that the induced beta oscillations were accompanied by a characteristic heart rate (HR) change in form of a preparatory HR acceleration followed by a short-lasting deceleration in the order of 10-20 bpm (beats-per-minute). This provides evidence that mental practice of motor performance is accompanied not only by activation of cortical structures but also by central commands into the cardiovascular system with its nuclei in the brain stem.
18035381,"We introduce quasi-movements and define them as volitional movements which are minimized by the subject to such an extent that finally they become undetectable by objective measures. They are intended as overt movements, but the absence of the measurable motor responses and the subjective experience make quasi-movements similar to motor imagery. We used the amplitude dynamics of electroencephalographic alpha oscillations as a marker of the regional involvement of cortical areas in three experimental tasks: movement execution, kinesthetic motor imagery, and quasi-movements. All three conditions were associated with a significant suppression of alpha oscillations over the sensorimotor hand area of the contralateral hemisphere. This suppression was strongest for executed movements, and stronger for quasi-movements than for motor imagery. The topography of alpha suppression was similar in all three conditions. Proprioceptive sensations related to quasi-movements contribute to the assumption that the ""sense of movement"" can originate from central efferent processes. Quasi-movements are also congruent with the postulated continuity between motor imagery and movement preparation/execution. We also show that in healthy subjects quasi-movements can be effectively used in brain-computer interface research leading to a significantly smaller classification error ( approximately 47% of relative decrease) in comparison to the errors obtained with conventionally used motor imagery strategies."
18003143,"A motor imagery based brain-computer interface (BCI) translates the subject's motor intention into a control signal through real-time detection of characteristic EEG spatial distributions corresponding to motor imagination of different body parts. In this paper, we implemented a three-class BCI manipulated through imagination of left hand, right hand and foot movements, inducing different spatial patterns of event-related desynchronization (ERD) on mu rhythms over the sensory-motor cortex. A two-step training approach was proposed including consecutive steps of online adaptive training and offline training. Then, the optimized parameters and classifiers were utilized for online control. This paradigm facilitated three directional movement controls which could be easily applied to help the motion-disabled to operate a wheelchair. The average online and offline classification accuracy on five subjects was 79.48% and 85.00% respectively, promoting the three-class motor imagery based BCI a promising means to realize brain control of a mobile device."
18002686,"Asynchronous Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is an important class of BCI systems that has not received enough attention from the BCI community. In this work we introduce for the first time a system for classification of four different motor imageries in the context of an asynchronous BCI system which distinguishes between periods of movement imagination occurrence and idling or resting periods of ongoing EEG signal as well as classifying the 4 class motor imageries. We used two multi class extensions of the method of Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) for feature extraction and LDA, SVM, and MDA well known classifiers for combination purposes. We have applied our procedure to data set IIIa from BCI Competition III [2]. Offline evaluation of a prototype system demonstrated true positive rates in the range of 56%-88% with corresponding false positive rates in the range of 18%-9%."
18002505,This paper presents an automated method for relevant frequency bands identification to be used in a left/right hand motor imagery based Brain Computer Interface system. The adopted optimization method aimed at maximizing the ratio between the mutual information and the error rate obtained using a Regularized Linear Discriminant Analysis (RLDA) based classifier and band-specific amplitude modulated envelopes as features. The search problem was handled by a genetic algorithm starting from an initial population determined on the basis of a-priori mu and beta relevant frequency bands identified by means of a standard power spectral density analysis between the idle and the left/right imagery data subset.
18002053,"The accurate discrimination of EEG times-series is a challenging problem and has become a topic of prominent research interest, given the extent of the research activity in the area of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. Many signal processing algorithms involving preprocessing, feature extraction/selection, and classification have been deployed and yet, the most appropriate and robust solutions are still being sought. This paper presents an analysis of a new methodology for feature extraction in a BCI which is based on identifying the extent of ultrametricity from EEG time-series. This work is inspired by the idea that there are natural, not necessarily unique, tree or hierarchy structures defined by the ultrametric topology of EEG time-series. The objective is to determine if coefficients which reflect the extent of ultrametricity can be used as distinct features of different EEG time series, recorded whilst subjects imagine left/right hand movements (motor imagery(MI)). The results show that MI based EEG time-series can be separated using a local ultrametricity quantifier and a linear discriminant classifier or Bayes classifier. Also, it is shown that neural-time-series-prediction-preprocessing (NTSPP) produces a higher dimensional space in which local ultrametricity is more separable for two classes of EEG signals."
17946815,"Non invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCI) allow people to communicate by modulating features of their electroencephalogram (EEG). Spatiotemporal filtering has a vital role in multi-class, EEG based BCI. In this study, we used a novel combination of principle component analysis, independent component analysis and dipole source localization to design a spatiotemporal multiple source tuning (SPAMSORT) filter bank, each channel of which was tuned to the activity of an underlying dipole source. Changes in the event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) were measured and used to train a linear support vector machine to classify between four classes of motor imagery tasks (left hand, right hand, foot and tongue) for one subject. ERSP values were significantly (p<0.01) different across tasks and better (p<0.01) than conventional spatial filtering methods (large Laplacian and common average reference). Classification resulted in an average accuracy of 82.5%. This approach could lead to promising BCI applications such as control of a prosthesis with multiple degrees of freedom."
17946524,"We introduce an adaptive space time frequency analysis to extract and classify subject specific brain oscillations induced by motor imagery in a brain computer interface task. The introduced method requires no prior knowledge of the reactive frequency bands, their temporal behavior or cortical locations. The algorithm implements an arbitrary time-frequency segmentation procedure by using a flexible local discriminant base algorithm for given multichannel brain activity recordings to extract subject specific ERD and ERS patterns. Extracted time-frequency features are processed by principal component analysis to reduce the feature set which is highly correlated due to volume conduction and the neighbor cortical regions. The reduced feature set is then fed to a linear discriminant analysis for classification. We give experimental results for 9 subjects to show the superior performance of the proposed method where the classification accuracy varied between 76.4% and 96.8% and the average classification accuracy was 84.9%"
17946502,"The issue of subject-specific parameter selection in an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is tackled in this paper. Hjorth- and Barlow-based feature extraction procedures (FEPs) are investigated along with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for classification. These are well-known nonparametric FEPs but their simplicity prevents them from matching the performance of more complex FEPs. Neural time-series prediction preprocessing (NTSPP) has been shown to enhance the separability of both time- and frequency-based features and is used in this work to improve the applicability of these FEPs. NTSPP uses a number of prediction modules (PMs) to perform m-step ahead prediction of EEG time-series recorded whilst subjects perform motor imagery-based mental tasks. Depending on the PMs, the NTSPP framework normally requires subject-specific parameters to be predefined. In this work each PM is a self-organizing fuzzy neural network (SOFNN). The SOFNN has a self-organizing structure and good nonlinear approximation capabilities however; a number of parameters must be defined prior to training. This is problematic therefore the practicality of a general set of parameters, previously selected via a sensitivity analysis (SA), is analyzed. The results indicate that a general set of NTSPP parameters may provide the best results and therefore a fully nonparametric BCI may be realizable."
17946448,"Brain computer interface (BCI) is based on brain activity from voluntary will, and controls a computer system through only the imagination or other mental activity. In order to improve the performance of the BCI system based on the scalp EEG, it is important to determine suitable locations for the EEG electrodes according to brain activity as well as the location of reference electrode of the EEG, while most of conventional studies do not much consider about the location of the reference electrode. In this paper, we estimate the proper reference electrode location of the BCI system whose mental tasks are left and right finger movement imagination. The suggested location of the reference electrode is obtained by analyzing the fMRI imaging results. Further online EEG experiment confirmed that choosing supplementary motor area (SMA) as the reference is effective in enhancing the performance of the BCI system."
17945956,"The multichannel electrocorticogram (ECoG)/electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are commonly used to classify two kinds of motor imagery (MI) tasks. In this paper, the ECoG and EEG data sets are composed of training and test data, which are recorded during different time/days. Power spectral density (PSD) is selected as features; Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) and common spatial patterns (CSP) are used to filter redundancy; K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) classifier is applied to classify MI tasks; and a new function R (k) is presented to estimate the value of k. Using these methods, we obtain the predictive accuracy of MI tasks based on ECoG data (which is 92%) and EEG data (which is 81%). The results show that we can effectively classify two kinds of MI tasks based on EEG as well as ECoG."
17945624,"Motor imagery is the mental simulation of a motor act that includes preparation for movement, passive observations of action and mental operations of motor representations implicitly or explicitly. Motor imagery as preparation for immediate movement likely involves the motor executive brain regions. Implicit mental operations of motor representations are considered to underlie cognitive functions. Another problem concerning neuro-imaging studies on motor imagery is that the performance of imagination is very difficult to control. The ability of an individual to control its EEG may enable him to communicate without being able to control their voluntary muscles. Communication based on EEG signals does not require neuromuscular control and the individuals who have neuromuscular disorders and who may have no more control over any of their conventional communication abilities may still be able to communicate through a direct brain-computer interface. A brain-computer interface replaces the use of nerves and muscles and the movements they produce with electrophysiological signals and is coupled with the hardware and software that translate those signals into physical actions. One of the most important components of a brain-computer interface is the EEG feature extraction procedure. This paper presents an approach that uses self-organizing fuzzy neural network based time series prediction that performs EEG feature extraction in the time domain only. EEG is recorded from two electrodes placed on the scalp over the motor cortex. EEG signals from each electrode are predicted by a single fuzzy neural network. Features derived from the mean squared error of the predictions and from the mean squared of the predicted signals are extracted from EEG data by means of a sliding window. The architecture of the two auto-organizing fuzzy neural networks is a network with multi inputs and single output."
17945612,"In the last decade, the possibility to noninvasively estimate cortical activity has been highlighted by the application of the techniques known as high resolution EEG. These techniques include a subject's multi-compartment head model (scalp, skull, dura mater, cortex) constructed from individual magnetic resonance images, multi-dipole source model, and regularized linear inverse source estimates of cortical current density. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that the use of cortical activity estimated from noninvasive EEG recordings of motor imagery is useful in the context of a brain computer interface as compared with others scalp spatial filters usually used on-line."
17945570,"A motor imagery based brain-computer interface (BCI) translates the subject's motor intention into a control signal. For this BCI system, most algorithms are based on power changes of mu and beta rhythms. In this paper, we employ the measurement of phase synchrony to investigate the activities of the supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary motor area (M1) during left/right hand movement imagery. The single-trial phase locking value (PLV) features were derived from intrinsic large-scale and local-scale phase synchronies between and within SMA and M1. The classification performance suggests that phase synchrony is an additional robust feature for differentiating motor imagery states."
17941986,"It has been suggested that Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) may one day be suitable for controlling a neuroprosthesis. For closed-loop operation of BCI, a tactile feedback channel that is compatible with neuroprosthetic applications is desired. Operation of an EEG-based BCI using only vibrotactile feedback, a commonly used method to convey haptic senses of contact and pressure, is demonstrated with a high level of accuracy. A Mu-rhythm based BCI using a motor imagery paradigm was used to control the position of a virtual cursor. The cursor position was shown visually as well as transmitted haptically by modulating the intensity of a vibrotactile stimulus to the upper limb. A total of six subjects operated the BCI in a two-stage targeting task, receiving only vibrotactile biofeedback of performance. The location of the vibration was also systematically varied between the left and right arms to investigate location-dependent effects on performance. Subjects are able to control the BCI using only vibrotactile feedback with an average accuracy of 56% and as high as 72%. These accuracies are significantly higher than the 15% predicted by random chance if the subject had no voluntary control of their Mu-rhythm. The results of this study demonstrate that vibrotactile feedback is an effective biofeedback modality to operate a BCI using motor imagery. In addition, the study shows that placement of the vibrotactile stimulation on the biceps ipsilateral or contralateral to the motor imagery introduces a significant bias in the BCI accuracy. This bias is consistent with a drop in performance generated by stimulation of the contralateral limb. Users demonstrated the capability to overcome this bias with training."
17873424,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a device that allows a user to communicate with external devices through thought processes alone. A novel signal acquisition tool for BCIs is near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), an optical technique to measure localized cortical brain activity. The benefits of using this non-invasive modality are safety, portability and accessibility. A number of commercial multi-channel NIRS system are available; however we have developed a straightforward custom-built system to investigate the functionality of a fNIRS-BCI system. This work describes the construction of the device, the principles of operation and the implementation of a fNIRS-BCI application, 'Mindswitch' that harnesses motor imagery for control. Analysis is performed online and feedback of performance is presented to the user. Mindswitch presents a basic 'on/off' switching option to the user, where selection of either state takes 1 min. Initial results show that fNIRS can support simple BCI functionality and shows much potential. Although performance may be currently inferior to many EEG systems, there is much scope for development particularly with more sophisticated signal processing and classification techniques. We hope that by presenting fNIRS as an accessible and affordable option, a new avenue of exploration will open within the BCI research community and stimulate further research in fNIRS-BCIs."
17601202,"This paper studies the use of fuzzy inference systems (FISs) for motor imagery classification in electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The results of the four studies achieved are promising as, on the analysed data, the used FIS was efficient, interpretable, showed good capabilities of rejecting outliers and offered the possibility of using a priori knowledge."
17587169,"Accumulating evidence suggests the existence of a shared neural substrate between imagined and executed movements. However, a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the motor execution and motor imagery requires knowledge of the way the co-activated brain regions interact to each other during the particular (real or imagined) motor task. Within this general framework, the aim of the present study is to investigate the cortical activation and connectivity sub-serving real and imaginary rhythmic finger tapping, from the analysis of multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) scalp recordings. A sequence of 250 auditory pacing stimuli has been used for both the real and imagined right finger tapping task, with a constant inter-stimulus interval of 1.5 s length. During the motor execution, healthy subjects were asked to tap in synchrony with the regular sequence of stimulus events, whereas in the imagery condition subjects imagined themselves tapping in time with the auditory cue. To improve the spatial resolution of the scalp fields and suppress unwanted interferences, the EEG data have been spatially filtered. Further, event related synchronization and desynchronization phenomena and phase synchronization analysis have been employed for the study of functionally active brain areas and their connectivity during real and imagery finger tapping. Our results show a fronto-parietal co-activation during both real and imagined movements and similar connectivity patterns among contralateral brain areas. The results support the hypothesis that functional connectivity over the contralateral hemisphere during finger tapping is preserved in imagery. The approach and results can be regarded as indicative evidences of a new strategy for recognizing imagined movements in EEG-based brain computer interface research."
17476000,"Cortical networks underlying motor imagery are functionally close to motor performance networks and can be activated by patients with severe motor disabilities. The aim of the study was to examine the longitudinal effect of progressive motoneuron degeneration on cortical representation of motor imagery and function in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The authors studied 14 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients and 15 healthy controls and a subgroup of 11 patients and 14 controls after 6 months with a grip force paradigm comprising imagery and execution tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Motor imagery activated similar neural networks as motor execution in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients and healthy subjects in the primary motor (BA 4), premotor, and supplementary motor (BA 6) cortex. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients presented a stronger response within premotor and primary motor areas for imagery and execution compared to controls. After 6 months, these differences persisted with additional activity in the precentral gyrus in patients as well as in a frontoparietal network for motor imagery, in which activity increased with impairment. The findings suggest an ongoing compensatory process within the higher order motor-processing system of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients, probably to overcome loss of function in primary motor and motor imagery-specific networks. The increased activity in precentral and frontoparietal networks in motor imagery might be used to control brain-computer interfaces to drive communication and limb prosthetic devices in patients with loss of motor control such as severely disabled amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients in a locked-in-like state."
17475511,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow for communicating intentions by mere brain activity, not involving muscles. Thus, BCIs may offer patients who have lost all voluntary muscle control the only possible way to communicate. Many recent studies have demonstrated that BCIs based on electroencephalography (EEG) can allow healthy and severely paralyzed individuals to communicate. While this approach is safe and inexpensive, communication is slow. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) provides signals with higher spatiotemporal resolution than EEG and could thus be used to explore whether these improved signal properties translate into increased BCI communication speed. In this study, we investigated the utility of an MEG-based BCI that uses voluntary amplitude modulation of sensorimotor mu and beta rhythms. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, we present a simple spatial filtering method that takes the geometric properties of signal propagation in MEG into account, and we present methods that can process artifacts specifically encountered in an MEG-based BCI. Exemplarily, six participants were successfully trained to communicate binary decisions by imagery of limb movements using a feedback paradigm. Participants achieved significant mu rhythm self control within 32 min of feedback training. For a subgroup of three participants, we localized the origin of the amplitude modulated signal to the motor cortex. Our results suggest that an MEG-based BCI is feasible and efficient in terms of user training."
17409476,"The goal of the present study is to employ the source imaging methods such as cortical current density estimation for the classification of left- and right-hand motor imagery tasks, which may be used for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. The scalp recorded EEG was first preprocessed by surface Laplacian filtering, time-frequency filtering, noise normalization and independent component analysis. Then the cortical imaging technique was used to solve the EEG inverse problem. Cortical current density distributions of left and right trials were classified from each other by exploiting the concept of Von Neumann entropy. The proposed method was tested on three human subjects (180 trials each) and a maximum accuracy of 91.5% and an average accuracy of 88% were obtained. The present results confirm the hypothesis that source analysis methods may improve accuracy for classification of motor imagery tasks. The present promising results using source analysis for classification of motor imagery enhances our ability of performing source analysis from single trial EEG data recorded on the scalp, and may have applications to improved BCI systems."
17367076,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology can offer individuals with severe motor disabilities greater independence and a higher quality of life. The BCI systems take recorded brain signals and translate them into real-time actions, for improved communication, movement, or perception. Four patient participants with a clinical need for intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) participated in this study. The participants were trained over multiple sessions to use motor and/or auditory imagery to modulate their brain signals in order to control the movement of a computer cursor. Participants with electrodes over motor and/or sensory areas were able to achieve cursor control over 2 to 7 days of training. These findings indicate that sensory and other brain areas not previously considered ideal for ECoG-based control can provide additional channels of control that may be useful for a motor BCI."
17355071,"A study of different on-line adaptive classifiers, using various feature types is presented. Motor imagery brain computer interface (BCI) experiments were carried out with 18 naive able-bodied subjects. Experiments were done with three two-class, cue-based, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based systems. Two continuously adaptive classifiers were tested: adaptive quadratic and linear discriminant analysis. Three feature types were analyzed, adaptive autoregressive parameters, logarithmic band power estimates and the concatenation of both. Results show that all systems are stable and that the concatenation of features with continuously adaptive linear discriminant analysis classifier is the best choice of all. Also, a comparison of the latter with a discontinuously updated linear discriminant analysis, carried out in on-line experiments with six subjects, showed that on-line adaptation performed significantly better than a discontinuous update. Finally a static subject-specific baseline was also provided and used to compare performance measurements of both types of adaptation."
17347747,"The aim of this paper is to develop a new algorithm to enhance the performance of EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI). We improved our time-frequency approach of classification of motor imagery (MI) tasks for BCI applications. The approach consists of Laplacian filtering, band-pass filtering and classification by correlation of time-frequency-spatial patterns. Through off-line analysis of data collected during a ""cursor control"" experiment, we evaluated the capability of our new method to reveal major features of the EEG control for enhancement of MI classification accuracy. The pilot results in a human subject are promising, with an accuracy rate of 96.1%."
17281476,This paper presents a preprocessing procedure for improving the separability of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded from subjects for a right/left motor imagery based brain-computer interface (BCI). The EEG data is preprocessed utilizing a recently proposed time-series-prediction (TSP) technique. Two neural networks (NNs) are trained to perform one-step-ahead predictions of the EEG time-series data where one NN is trained to predict right motor imagery signals and the other left motor imagery signals. The NNs are used in a procedure referred to as neural-time-series-prediction-preprocessing (NTSPP) where signals are fed into both NNs and two new signal types are produced i.e. the predicted signals (Ys) or the prediction error signals (Es). In this investigation the well known adaptive autoregressive modeling (AAR) technique is used to extract features from the Es and Ys signals. Classification is performed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This NTSPP procedure is tested offline on three subjects and classification accuracy (CA) rates approach 98%. The approach shows significant potential for improving robustness and feature stability across sessions and a clearly distinguishable improvement in performance is observed when features are extracted from the NTSPP signals compared to those extracted from the original signals (Os).
17281471,"A brain-computer interface(BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) translates the subject's motor intention into a control signal through classifying the electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns of different imagination tasks, e.g. hand and foot movements. Characteristic EEG spatial patterns make MI tasks substantially discriminable. Multi-channel EEGs are usually necessary for spatial pattern identification and therefore MI-based BCI is still in the stage of laboratory demonstration, to some extent, due to the need for constanly troublesome recording preparation. This paper presents a method for channel reduction in MI-based BCI. Common spatial pattern (CSP) method was employed to analyze spatial patterns of imagined hand and foot movements. Significant channels were selelcted by searching the maximunms of spatial pattern vectors in scalp mappings. A classification algorithm was developed by means of combining linear discriminat analysis towards even-related desynchronization (ERD) and readiness potential (RP). The classification accuracies with four optimal channels were 93.45% and 91.88% for two subjects."
17271653,"This article explores the use of independent component analysis (ICA) approach to design a new EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) for natural control of prosthetic hand grasp. ICA is a useful technique that allows blind separation of sources, linearly mixed, assuming only the statistical independence of these sources. This suggests the possibility of using ICA to separate different independent brain activities during motor imagery into separate components. This work provides a natural basis for developing an efficient BCI based on single-source data obtained by independent component analysis of multi-channel EEG. The tasks to be discriminated are the imagination of hand grasping and opening and the resting state. The results indicate that the proposed scheme can improve the classification accuracy of the EEG patterns. Imagery is the essential part of the most EEG-based communication systems. Thus, the quality of mental rehearsal, the degree of imagined effort, and mind controllability should have a major effect on the performance of EEG-based BCI. We are going to examine the role of mental practice and concentration skills on the performance of BCI. The surprising results indicate that mental training has a significant effect on the performance of BCI over the primary motor cortex, temporal, and frontal areas. This supports the hypothesis that mental practice is an effective method for performance enhancement and motor skill learning."
17271589,"EEG-based brain computer interface (BCI) provides a completely new communication channel between human brain and computer. Classification of EEG signals is a difficult task, especially when the classification has to be preformed on a single-trial EEG to continuously control a device. Event related desynchronization (ERD) has proven to be induced on the contralateral sensorimotor area during imagination of a left or right hand movement. In this paper, we introduced a quantification of ERD, with which a lower classification error rate and a higher information transfer rate can be obtained. The performance was tested by the Graz dataset for BCI competition 2003."
17271307,"This paper gives a short overview of the feasibility of walking through a virtual city by using motor imagery. Therefore an electroencephalogram-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is combined with virtual reality technology. A BCI transforms bioelectrical brain signals, modulated by mental activity (e.g. imagination of foot or right hand movements), into a control signal. This signal is used to walk forward / backward or to remain stationary inside a virtual city. Results of the first experimental sessions are presented."
17271274,The aim of this paper is to analyze whether the use of the cortical activity estimated from non invasive EEG recordings could be useful to detect mental states related to the imagination of limb movements. Estimation of cortical activity was performed on high resolution EEG data related to the imagination of limb movements gathered in five normal healthy subjects by using realistic head models. Cortical activity was estimated in region of interest associated with the subject's Brodmann areas by using depth-weighted minimum norm solutions. Comparisons between surface recorded EEG and the estimated cortical activity were performed. The estimated cortical activity related to the mental imagery of limbs in the five subjects is located mainly over the contralateral primary motor area. The unbalance between brain activity estimated in contralateral and ipsilateral motor cortical areas relative to the finger movement imagination is greater than those obtained in the scalp EEG recordings. Results suggest that the use of the estimated cortical activity for the motor imagery of upper limbs could be potentially superior with respect to the use of surface EEG recordings. This is due to a greater statistically significant unbalance between the activity estimated in the contralateral and ipsilateral hemisphere with respect to those observed with surface EEG. These results are useful in the context of the development of a non invasive brain computer interface.
17271273,This paper presents a novel feature extraction procedure (FEP) for extracting features from the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded from subjects producing right and left motor imagery. Four self-organizing fuzzy neural networks (SOFNNs) are coalesced to perform one-step-ahead predictions for the EEG time series data. Features are derived from the mean squared error (MSE) in prediction or the mean squared of the predicted signals (MSY). Classification is performed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This novel FEP is tested on three subjects offline and classification accuracy (CA) rates approach 94% with information transfer (IT) rates >10 bits/min. Minimum subject specific data analysis is required and the approach shows good potential for online feature extraction and autonomous system adaptation.
17271270,"We have developed a single trial motor imagery (MI) classification strategy for the brain computer interface (BCI) applications by using time-frequency synthesis approach to accommodate the individual difference, and using the spatial patterns derived from EEG rhythmic components as the feature description. The EEGs are decomposed into a series of frequency bands, and the instantaneous power is represented by the envelop of oscillatory activity, which formed the spatial patterns for a given electrode montage at a time-frequency grid. Time-frequency weights determined by training process were used to synthesize the contributions at the time-frequency domains. The overall classification accuracies for three selected human subjects performing left or right hand movement imagery tasks, were about 87 percent in the ten-fold cross validation without rejecting trials. The loci of motor imagery activity were shown in the spatial topography of differential mode patterns over the sensorimotor area. The present method promises to provide a useful alternative as a general purpose classification procedure for motor imagery classification."
17196832,"There has been an increase in research interest for brain-computer interface (BCI) technology as an alternate mode of communication and environmental control for the disabled, such as patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brainstem stroke and spinal cord injury. Disabled patients with appropriate physical care and cognitive ability to communicate with their social environment continue to live with a reasonable quality of life over extended periods of time. Near-infrared spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique which utilizes light in the near-infrared range (700 to 1000 nm) to determine cerebral oxygenation, blood flow and metabolic status of localized regions of the brain. In this paper, we describe a study conducted to test the feasibility of using multichannel NIRS in the development of a BCI. We used a continuous wave 20-channel NIRS system over the motor cortex of 5 healthy volunteers to measure oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin changes during left-hand and right-hand motor imagery. We present results of signal analysis indicating that there exist distinct patterns of hemodynamic responses which could be utilized in a pattern classifier towards developing a BCI. We applied two different pattern recognition algorithms separately, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM), to classify the data offline. SVM classified left-hand imagery from right-hand imagery with an average accuracy of 73% for all volunteers, while HMM performed better with an average accuracy of 89%. Our results indicate potential application of NIRS in the development of BCIs. We also discuss here future extension of our system to develop a word speller application based on a cursor control paradigm incorporating online pattern classification of single-trial NIRS data."
17153207,"Currently, almost all brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) ignore the relationship between phases of electroencephalographic signals detected from different recording sites (i.e., electrodes). The vast majority of BCI systems rely on feature vectors derived from e.g., bandpower or univariate adaptive autoregressive (AAR) parameters. However, ample evidence suggests that additional information is obtained by quantifying the relationship between signals of single electrodes, which might provide innovative features for future BCI systems. This paper investigates one method to extract the degree of phase synchronization between two electroencephalogram (EEG) signals by calculating the so-called phase locking value (PLV). In our offline study, several PLV-based features were acquired and the optimal feature set was selected for each subject individually by a feature selection algorithm. The online sessions with three trained subjects revealed that all subjects were able to control three mental states (motor imagery of left hand, right hand, and foot, respectively) with single-trial accuracies between 60% and 66.7% (33% would be expected by chance) throughout the whole session."
17139517,"We present a study of linear, quadratic and regularized discriminant analysis (RDA) applied to motor imagery data of three subjects. The aim of the work was to find out which classifier can separate better these two-class motor imagery data: linear, quadratic or some function in between the linear and quadratic solutions. Discriminant analysis methods were tested with two different feature extraction techniques, adaptive autoregressive parameters and logarithmic band power estimates, which are commonly used in brain-computer interface research. Differences in classification accuracy of the classifiers were found when using different amounts of data; if a small amount was available, the best classifier was linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and if enough data were available all three classifiers performed very similar. This suggests that the effort needed to find regularizing parameters for RDA can be avoided by using LDA."
17124328,"A method based on wavelet packet best basis decomposition (WPBBD) is investigated for the purpose of extracting features of electroencephalogram signals produced during motor imagery tasks in brain-computer interfaces. The method includes the following three steps. (1) Original signals are decomposed by wavelet packet transform (WPT) and a wavelet packet library can be formed. (2) The best basis for classification is selected from the library. (3) Subband energies included in the best basis are used as effective features. Three different motor imagery tasks are discriminated using the features. The WPBBD produces a 70.3% classification accuracy, which is 4.2% higher than that of the existing wavelet packet method."
17082506,"To investigate the technical and clinical viability of using computer-facilitated mental practice in the rehabilitation of upper-limb hemiparesis following stroke. A single-case study. Academic-affiliated rehabilitation center. A 46-year-old man with stable motor deficit of the upper right limb following subcortical ischemic stroke. Three computer-enhanced mental practice sessions per week at the rehabilitation center, in addition to usual physical therapy. A custom-made virtual reality system equipped with arm-tracking sensors was used to guide mental practice. The system was designed to superimpose over the (unseen) paretic arm a virtual reconstruction of the movement registered from the nonparetic arm. The laboratory intervention was followed by a 1-month home-rehabilitation program, making use of a portable display device. Pretreatment and posttreatment clinical assessment measures were the upper-extremity scale of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Sensorimotor Impairment and the Action Research Arm Test. Performance of the affected arm was evaluated using the healthy arm as the control condition. The patient's paretic limb improved after the first phase of intervention, with modest increases after home rehabilitation, as indicated by functional assessment scores and sensors data. Results suggest that technology-supported mental training is a feasible and potentially effective approach for improving motor skills after stroke."
17071247,"ERD/ERS patterns characterize the dynamics of brain oscillations time-locked but not phase-locked to an externally or internally triggered event. Recent studies have shown that ERD/ERS phenomena in narrow frequency bands are remarkably stable over time and across different testing situations. The high reproducibility of ERD/ERS promotes the usefulness of this biometric measure in assessing individual characteristics. In addition to the spatio-temporal patterns of (de)synchronization processes the most reactive frequency components are especially highly subject-specific and, therefore, open up new possibilities for user authentication and person identification. In contrast, ERD/ERS research will continue to be useful in clinical brain-computer interface (BCI) implementation. Promising novel applications of an ERD/ERS based BCI may contribute to enhanced functional recovery and rehabilitation in patients suffering from chronic stroke. According to current therapeutic strategies, feedback-regulated motor imagery could be used to enhance antagonistic ERD/ERS patterns and therewith, support activation of the stroke affected and inhibition of the non-affected, contralesional hemisphere."
17071244,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) transforms signals originating from the human brain into commands that can control devices or applications. With this, a BCI provides a new non-muscular communication channel, which can be used to assist patients who have highly compromised motor functions. The Graz-BCI uses motor imagery and associated oscillatory EEG signals from the sensorimotor cortex for device control. As a result of research in the past 15 years, the classification of ERD/ERS patterns in single EEG trials during motor execution and motor imagery forms the basis of this sensorimotor-rhythm controlled BCI. The major frequency bands of cortical oscillations considered here are the 8-13 and 15-30 Hz bands. This chapter describes the basic methods used in Graz-BCI research and outlines possible clinical applications."
17028907,"Mental imagination is the essential part of the most EEG-based communication systems. Thus, the quality of mental rehearsal, the degree of imagined effort, and mind controllability should have a major effect on the performance of electro-encephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI). It is now well established that mental practice using motor imagery improves motor skills. The effects of mental practice on motor skill learning are the result of practice on central motor programming. According to this view, it seems logical that mental practice should modify the neuronal activity in the primary sensorimotor areas and consequently change the performance of EEG-based BCI. For developing a practical BCI system, recognizing the resting state with eyes opened and the imagined voluntary movement is important. For this purpose, the mind should be able to focus on a single goal for a period of time, without deviation to another context. In this work, we are going to examine the role of mental practice and concentration skills on the EEG control during imaginative hand movements. The results show that the mental practice and concentration can generally improve the classification accuracy of the EEG patterns. It is found that mental training has a significant effect on the classification accuracy over the primary motor cortex and frontal area."
17010962,"We introduce a new adaptive time-frequency plane feature extraction strategy for the segmentation and classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) corresponding to left and right hand motor imagery of a brain-computer interface task. The proposed algorithm adaptively segments the time axis by dividing the EEG data into non-uniform time segments over a dyadic tree. This is followed by grouping the expansion coefficients in the frequency axis in each segment. The most discriminative features are selected from the segmented time-frequency plane and fed to a linear discriminant for classification. The proposed algorithm achieved an average classification accuracy of 84.3% on six subjects by selecting the most discriminant subspaces for each one. For comparison, classification results based on an autoregressive model are also presented where the mean accuracy of the same subjects turned out to be 79.5%. Interestingly the subjects and two hemispheres of each subject are represented by distinct segmentations and features. This indicates that the proposed method can handle inter-subject variability when constructing brain-computer interfaces."
16921207,"We describe a new technique for the classification of motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in a brain computer interface (BCI) task. The technique is based on an adaptive time-frequency analysis of EEG signals computed using local discriminant bases (LDB) derived from local cosine packets (LCP). In an offline step, the EEG data obtained from the C(3)/C(4) electrode locations of the standard 10/20 system is adaptively segmented in time, over a non-dyadic grid by maximizing the probabilistic distances between expansion coefficients corresponding to left and right hand movement imagery. This is followed by a frequency domain clustering procedure in each adapted time segment to maximize the discrimination power of the resulting time-frequency features. Then, the most discriminant features from the resulting arbitrarily segmented time-frequency plane are sorted. A principal component analysis (PCA) step is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. This reduced feature set is finally fed to a linear discriminant for classification. The online step simply computes the reduced dimensionality features determined by the offline step and feeds them to the linear discriminant. We provide experimental data to show that the method can adapt to physio-anatomical differences, subject-specific and hemisphere-specific motor imagery patterns. The algorithm was applied to all nine subjects of the BCI Competition 2002. The classification performance of the proposed algorithm varied between 70% and 92.6% across subjects using just two electrodes. The average classification accuracy was 80.6%. For comparison, we also implemented an adaptive autoregressive model based classification procedure that achieved an average error rate of 76.3% on the same subjects, and higher error rates than the proposed approach on each individual subject."
16921204,"This paper compares different ICA preprocessing algorithms on cross-validated training data as well as on unseen test data. The EEG data were recorded from 22 electrodes placed over the whole scalp during motor imagery tasks consisting of four different classes, namely the imagination of right hand, left hand, foot and tongue movements. Two sessions on different days were recorded for eight subjects. Three different independent components analysis (ICA) algorithms (Infomax, FastICA and SOBI) were studied and compared to common spatial patterns (CSP), Laplacian derivations and standard bipolar derivations, which are other well-known preprocessing methods. Among the ICA algorithms, the best performance was achieved by Infomax when using all 22 components as well as for the selected 6 components. However, the performance of Laplacian derivations was comparable with Infomax for both cross-validated and unseen data. The overall best four-class classification accuracies (between 33% and 84%) were obtained with CSP. For the cross-validated training data, CSP performed slightly better than Infomax, whereas for unseen test data, CSP yielded significantly better classification results than Infomax in one of the sessions."
16792306,"Human motor imagery (MI) tasks evoke electroencephalogram (EEG) signal changes. The features of these changes appear as subject-specific temporal traces of EEG rhythmic components at specific channels located over the scalp. Accurate classification of MI tasks based upon EEG may lead to a noninvasive brain-computer interface (BCI) to decode and convey intention of human subjects. We have previously proposed two novel methods on time-frequency feature extraction, expression and classification for high-density EEG recordings (Wang and He 2004; Wang, Deng, and He, 2004). In the present study, we refined the above time-frequency-spatial approach and applied it to a one-dimensional ""cursor control"" BCI experiment with online feedback. Through offline analysis of the collected data, we evaluated the capability of the present refined method in comparison with the original time-frequency-spatial methods. The enhanced performance in terms of classification accuracy was found for the proposed approach, with a mean accuracy rate of 91.1% for two subjects studied."
16792289,"We summarize results from a series of related studies that aim to develop a motor-imagery-based brain-computer interface using a single recording session of electroencephalogram (EEG) or electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals for each subject. We apply the same experimental and analytical methods to 11 nonparalysed subjects (eight EEG, three ECoG), and to five paralyzed subjects (four EEG, one ECoG) who had been unable to communicate for some time. While it was relatively easy to obtain classifiable signals quickly from most of the nonparalyzed subjects, it proved impossible to classify the signals obtained from the paralyzed patients by the same methods. This highlights the fact that though certain BCI paradigms may work well with healthy subjects, this does not necessarily indicate success with the target user group. We outline possible reasons for this failure to transfer."
16761852,"A viable fully on-line adaptive brain computer interface (BCI) is introduced. On-line experiments with nine naive and able-bodied subjects were carried out using a continuously adaptive BCI system. The data were analyzed and the viability of the system was studied. The BCI was based on motor imagery, the feature extraction was performed with an adaptive autoregressive model and the classifier used was an adaptive quadratic discriminant analysis. The classifier was on-line updated by an adaptive estimation of the information matrix (ADIM). The system was also able to provide continuous feedback to the subject. The success of the feedback was studied analyzing the error rate and mutual information of each session and this analysis showed a clear improvement of the subject's control of the BCI from session to session."
16647153,"Cardiac responses induced by motor imagery were investigated in 3 subjects in a series of experiments with a synchronous (cue-based) Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). The cue specified right hand vs. leg/foot motor imagery. After a number of BCI training sessions reaching a classification accuracy of at least 80%, the BCI experiments were carried out in an immersive virtual environment (VE), commonly referred as a ""CAVE"". In this VE, the subjects were able to move along a virtual street by motor imagery alone. The thought-based control of VE resulted in an acceleration of the heart rate in 2 subjects and a heart rate deceleration in the other subject. In control experiments in front of a PC, all 3 subjects displayed a significant heart rate deceleration of the order of about 3-5%. This heart rate decrease during motor imagery in a normal environment is similar to that observed during preparation for a voluntary movement. The heart rate acceleration in the VE is interpreted as effect of an increased mental effort to walk as far as possible in VE."
16517206,"In this paper we discuss a subject-based feature extraction method using wavelet packet best basis decomposition (WPBBD) in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The idea is to employ the wavelet packet best basis algorithm to adapt to each subject separately. Firstly, original electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are decomposed to a given level by wavelet packet transform. Secondly, for each subject, the best basis algorithm is used to find the best-adapted basis for that particular subject. Finally, subband energies contained in the best basis are used as effective features. Adaptive and specific features of a subject are so obtained. Three different motor imagery tasks of six subjects are discriminated using the above features. Experiment results show that the subject-based adaptation method yields significantly higher classification performance than the non-subject-based adaptation and non-adaptive approaches."
16510942,"By three multi-channel linear descriptors, i.e. spatial complexity (omega), field power (sigma) and frequency of field changes (phi), event-related EEG data within 8-30 Hz were investigated during imagination of left or right hand movement. Studies on the event-related EEG data indicate that a two-channel version of omega, sigma and phi could reflect the antagonistic ERD/ERS patterns over contralateral and ipsilateral areas and also characterize different phases of the changing brain states in the event-related paradigm. Based on the selective two-channel linear descriptors, the left and right hand motor imagery tasks are classified to obtain satisfactory results, which testify the validity of the three linear descriptors omega, sigma and phi for characterizing event-related EEG. The preliminary results show that omega, sigma together with phi have good separability for left and right hand motor imagery tasks, which could be considered for classification of two classes of EEG patterns in the application of brain computer interfaces."
16443377,"We studied the reactivity of EEG rhythms (mu rhythms) in association with the imagination of right hand, left hand, foot, and tongue movement with 60 EEG electrodes in nine able-bodied subjects. During hand motor imagery, the hand mu rhythm blocked or desynchronized in all subjects, whereas an enhancement of the hand area mu rhythm was observed during foot or tongue motor imagery in the majority of the subjects. The frequency of the most reactive components was 11.7 Hz +/- 0.4 (mean +/- SD). While the desynchronized components were broad banded and centered at 10.9 Hz +/- 0.9, the synchronized components were narrow banded and displayed higher frequencies at 12.0 Hz +/- 1.0. The discrimination between the four motor imagery tasks based on classification of single EEG trials improved when, in addition to event-related desynchronization (ERD), event-related synchronization (ERS) patterns were induced in at least one or two tasks. This implies that such EEG phenomena may be utilized in a multi-class brain-computer interface (BCI) operated simply by motor imagery."
16425827,"This paper presents a feature extraction procedure (FEP) for a brain-computer interface (BCI) application where features are extracted from the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded from subjects performing right and left motor imagery. Two neural networks (NNs) are trained to perform one-step-ahead predictions for the EEG time-series data, where one NN is trained on right motor imagery and the other on left motor imagery. Features are derived from the power (mean squared) of the prediction error or the power of the predicted signals. All features are calculated from a window through which all predicted signals pass. Separability of features is achieved due to the morphological differences of the EEG signals and each NNs specialization to the type of data on which it is trained. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used for classification. This FEP is tested on three subjects off-line and classification accuracy (CA) rates range between 88% and 98%. The approach compares favorably to a well-known adaptive autoregressive (AAR) FEP and also a linear AAR model based prediction approach."
16405926,"Online analysis and classification of single electroencephalogram (EEG) trials during motor imagery were used for navigation in the virtual environment (VE). The EEG was recorded bipolarly with electrode placement over the hand and foot representation areas. The aim of the study was to demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to move through a virtual street without muscular activity when the participant only imagines feet movements. This is achieved by exploiting a brain-computer interface (BCI) which transforms thought-modulated EEG signals into an output signal that controls events within the VE. The experiments were carried out in an immersive projection environment, commonly referred to as a ""Cave"" (Cruz-Neira, C., Sandin, D.J., DeFanti, T.A., Surround-screen projection-based virtual reality: the design and implementation of the CAVE. Proceedings of the 20th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques, ACM Press, 1993, pp. 135-142) where participants were able to move through a virtual street by foot imagery only. Prior to the final experiments in the Cave, the participants underwent an extensive BCI training."
16317229,Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during motor imagery tasks are often used as input signals for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The translation of these EEG signals to control signals of a device is based on a good classification of various kinds of imagination. We have developed a wavelet-based time-frequency analysis approach for classifying motor imagery tasks. Time-frequency distributions (TFDs) were constructed based on wavelet decomposition and event-related (de)synchronization patterns were extracted from symmetric electrode pairs. The weighted energy difference of the electrode pairs was then compared to classify the imaginary movement. The present method has been tested in nine human subjects and reached an averaged classification rate of 78%. The simplicity of the present technique suggests that it may provide an alternative method for EEG-based BCI applications.
16317224,"To determine and compare the performance of different classifiers applied to four-class EEG data is the goal of this communication. The EEG data were recorded with 60 electrodes from five subjects performing four different motor-imagery tasks. The EEG signal was modeled by an adaptive autoregressive (AAR) process whose parameters were extracted by Kalman filtering. By these AAR parameters four classifiers were obtained, namely minimum distance analysis (MDA)--for single-channel analysis, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) classifiers as well as support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for multi-channel analysis. The performance of all four classifiers was quantified and evaluated by Cohen's kappa coefficient, an advantageous measure we introduced here to BCI research for the first time. The single-channel results gave rise to topographic maps that revealed the channels with the highest level of separability between classes for each subject. Our results of the multi-channel analysis indicate SVM as the most successful classifier, whereas kNN performed worst."
16236487,"Single-trial motor imagery classification is an integral part of a number of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. The possible significance of the kind of imagery, involving rather kinesthetic or visual representations of actions, was addressed using the following experimental conditions: kinesthetic motor imagery (MIK), visual-motor imagery (MIV), motor execution (ME) and observation of movement (OOM). Based on multi-channel EEG recordings in 14 right-handed participants, we applied a learning classifier, the distinction sensitive learning vector quantization (DSLVQ) to identify relevant features (i.e., frequency bands, electrode sites) for recognition of the respective mental states. For ME and OOM, the overall classification accuracies were about 80%. The rates obtained for MIK (67%) were better than the results of MIV (56%). Moreover, the focus of activity during kinesthetic imagery was found close to the sensorimotor hand area, whereas visual-motor imagery did not reveal a clear spatial pattern. Consequently, to improve motor-imagery-based BCI control, user training should emphasize kinesthetic experiences instead of visual representations of actions."
16133914,"Motor imagery electroencephalography (EEG), which embodies cortical potentials during mental simulation of left or right finger lifting tasks, can be used to provide neural input signals to activate a brain computer interface (BCI). The effectiveness of such an EEG-based BCI system relies on two indispensable components: distinguishable patterns of brain signals and accurate classifiers. This work aims to extract two reliable neural features, termed contralateral and ipsilateral rebound maps, by removing artifacts from motor imagery EEG based on independent component analysis (ICA), and to employ four classifiers to investigate the efficacy of rebound maps. Results demonstrate that, with the use of ICA, recognition rates for four classifiers (fisher linear discriminant (FLD), back-propagation neural network (BP-NN), radial-basis function neural network (RBF-NN), and support vector machine (SVM)) improved significantly, from 54%, 54%, 57% and 55% to 70.5%, 75.5%, 76.5% and 77.3%, respectively. In addition, the areas under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, which assess the quality of classification over a wide range of misclassification costs, also improved from .65, .60, .62, and .64 to .74, .76, .80 and .81, respectively."
16106660,This chapter presents a review of brain-computer communication based on motor imagery and the dynamics of brain oscillations. The concept of motor imagery as experimental strategy and the two different modes of operation a brain-computer interface can have are explained. An EEG based brain switch that can control a FES-induced hand grasp of a tetraplegic and an approach towards an ECoG based brain switch are presented.
16003895,"We have developed a novel approach using source analysis for classifying motor imagery tasks. Two-equivalent-dipoles analysis was proposed to aid classification of motor imagery tasks for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. By solving the electroencephalography (EEG) inverse problem of single trial data, it is found that the source analysis approach can aid classification of motor imagination of left- or right-hand movement without training. In four human subjects, an averaged accuracy of classification of 80% was achieved. The present study suggests the merits and feasibility of applying EEG inverse solutions to BCI applications from noninvasive EEG recordings."
15911143,"This case study demonstrates the coupling of an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) with an implanted neuroprosthesis (Freehand system). Because the patient was available for only 3 days, the goal was to demonstrate the possibility of a patient gaining control over the motor imagery-based Graz BCI system within a very short training period. By applying himself to an organized and coordinated training procedure, the patient was able to generate distinctive EEG-patterns by the imagination of movements of his paralyzed left hand. These patterns consisted of power decreases in specific frequency bands that could be classified by the BCI. The output signal of the BCI emulated the shoulder joystick usually used, and by consecutive imaginations the patient was able to switch between different grasp phases of the lateral grasp that the Freehand system provided. By performing a part of the grasp-release test, the patient was able to move a simple object from one place to another. The results presented in this work give evidence that Brain-Computer Interfaces are an option for the control of neuroprostheses in patients with high spinal cord lesions. The fact that the user learned to control the BCI in a comparatively short time indicates that this method may also be an alternative approach for clinical purposes."
15884704,"In this paper, we describe the possibility of navigating in a virtual environment using the output signal of an EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). The graphical capabilities of virtual reality (VR) should help to create new BCI-paradigms and improve feedback presentation. The objective of this combination is to enhance the subject's learning process of gaining control of the BCI. In this study, the participant had to imagine left or right hand movements while exploring a virtual conference room. By imaging a left hand movement the subject turned virtually to the left inside the room and with right hand imagery to the right. In fact, three trained subjects reached 80% to 100% BCI classification accuracy in the course of the experimental sessions. All subjects were able to achieve a rotation in the VR to the left or right by approximately 45 degrees during one trial."
15876632,"We report a pilot study of performing classification of motor imagery for brain-computer interface applications, by means of source analysis of scalp-recorded EEGs. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used as a spatio-temporal filter extracting signal components relevant to left or right motor imagery (MI) tasks. Source analysis methods including equivalent dipole analysis and cortical current density imaging were applied to reconstruct equivalent neural sources corresponding to MI, and classification was performed based on the inverse solutions. The classification was considered correct if the equivalent source was found over the motor cortex in the corresponding hemisphere. A classification rate of about 80% was achieved in the human subject studied using both the equivalent dipole analysis and the cortical current density imaging analysis. The present promising results suggest that the source analysis approach could manifest a clearer picture on the cortical activity, and thus facilitate the classification of MI tasks from scalp EEGs."
15876624,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable users to control devices with electroencephalographic (EEG) activity from the scalp or with single-neuron activity from within the brain. Both methods have disadvantages: EEG has limited resolution and requires extensive training, while single-neuron recording entails significant clinical risks and has limited stability. We demonstrate here for the first time that electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity recorded from the surface of the brain can enable users to control a one-dimensional computer cursor rapidly and accurately. We first identified ECoG signals that were associated with different types of motor and speech imagery. Over brief training periods of 3-24 min, four patients then used these signals to master closed-loop control and to achieve success rates of 74-100% in a one-dimensional binary task. In additional open-loop experiments, we found that ECoG signals at frequencies up to 180 Hz encoded substantial information about the direction of two-dimensional joystick movements. Our results suggest that an ECoG-based BCI could provide for people with severe motor disabilities a non-muscular communication and control option that is more powerful than EEG-based BCIs and is potentially more stable and less traumatic than BCIs that use electrodes penetrating the brain."
15876616,"The recognition of mental states during motor imagery tasks is crucial for EEG-based brain-computer interface research. We have developed a new algorithm by means of frequency decomposition and weighting synthesis strategy for recognizing imagined right- and left-hand movements. A frequency range from 5 to 25 Hz was divided into 20 band bins for each trial, and the corresponding envelopes of filtered EEG signals for each trial were extracted as a measure of instantaneous power at each frequency band. The dimensionality of the feature space was reduced from 200 (corresponding to 2 s) to 3 by down-sampling of envelopes of the feature signals, and subsequently applying principal component analysis. The linear discriminate analysis algorithm was then used to classify the features, due to its generalization capability. Each frequency band bin was weighted by a function determined according to the classification accuracy during the training process. The present classification algorithm was applied to a dataset of nine human subjects, and achieved a success rate of classification of 90% in training and 77% in testing. The present promising results suggest that the present classification algorithm can be used in initiating a general-purpose mental state recognition based on motor imagery tasks."
15546783,"To develop a single trial motor imagery (MI) classification strategy for the brain-computer interface (BCI) applications by using time-frequency synthesis approach to accommodate the individual difference, and using the spatial patterns derived from electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythmic components as the feature description. The EEGs are decomposed into a series of frequency bands, and the instantaneous power is represented by the envelop of oscillatory activity, which forms the spatial patterns for a given electrode montage at a time-frequency grid. Time-frequency weights determined by training process are used to synthesize the contributions from the time-frequency domains. The present method was tested in nine human subjects performing left or right hand movement imagery tasks. The overall classification accuracies for nine human subjects were about 80% in the 10-fold cross-validation, without rejecting any trials from the dataset. The loci of MI activity were shown in the spatial topography of differential-mode patterns over the sensorimotor area. The present method does not contain a priori subject-dependent parameters, and is computationally efficient. The testing results are promising considering the fact that no trials are excluded due to noise or artifact. The present method promises to provide a useful alternative as a general purpose classification procedure for MI classification."
15382823,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) gives those suffering from neuromuscular impairments a means to interact and communicate with their surrounding environment. A BCI translates physiological signals, typically electrical, detected from the brain to control an output device. A significant problem with current BCIs is the lengthy training periods involved for proficient usage, which can often lead to frustration and anxiety on the part of the user. Ultimately this can lead to abandonment of the device. The primary reason for this is that relatively indirect measures of cognitive function, as can be gleaned from the electroencephalogram (EEG), are harnessed. A more suitable and usable interface would need to measure cognitive function more directly. In order to do this, new measurement modalities, signal acquisition and processing, and translation algorithms need to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, using non-invasive near-infrared imaging technology to develop a user-friendly optical BCI. As an alternative to the traditional EEG-based devices, we have used practical non-invasive optical techniques to detect characteristic haemodynamic responses due to motor imagery and consequently created an accessible BCI that is simple to attach and requires little user training."
15218939,"Nearly all electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems operate in a cue-paced or synchronous mode. This means that the onset of mental activity (thought) is externally-paced and the EEG has to be analyzed in predefined time windows. In the near future, BCI systems that allow the user to intend a specific mental pattern whenever she/he wishes to produce such patterns will also become important. An asynchronous BCI is characterized by continuous analyzing and classification of EEG data. Therefore, it is important to maximize the hits (true positive rate) during an intended mental task and to minimize the false positive detections in the resting or idling state. EEG data recorded during right/left motor imagery is used to simulate an asynchronous BCI. To optimize the classification results, a refractory period and a dwell time are introduced."
15188871,Designing a brain computer interface (BCI) system one can choose from a variety of features that may be useful for classifying brain activity during a mental task. For the special case of classifying electroencephalogram (EEG) signals we propose the usage of the state of the art feature selection algorithms Recursive Feature Elimination and Zero-Norm Optimization which are based on the training of support vector machines (SVM). These algorithms can provide more accurate solutions than standard filter methods for feature selection. We adapt the methods for the purpose of selecting EEG channels. For a motor imagery paradigm we show that the number of used channels can be reduced significantly without increasing the classification error. The resulting best channels agree well with the expected underlying cortical activity patterns during the mental tasks. Furthermore we show how time dependent task specific information can be visualized.
15188868,"An improvement of the information transfer rate of brain-computer communication is necessary for the creation of more powerful and convenient applications. This paper presents an asynchronously controlled three-class brain-computer interface-based spelling device [virtual keyboard (VK)], operated by spontaneous electroencephalogram and modulated by motor imagery. Of the first results of three able-bodied subjects operating the VK, two were successful, showing an improvement of the spelling rate sigma, the number of correctly spelled letters/min, up to sigma = 3.38 (average sigma = 1.99)."
15142321,"Classification of single-trial imagined left- and right-hand movements recorded through scalp EEG are explored in this study. Classical event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) calculation approach was utilized to extract ERD features from the raw scalp EEG signal. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was used for feature extraction and applied on spatial, as well as temporal dimensions in two consecutive steps. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using a linear decision function was used to classify each trial as either left or right. The present approach has yielded good classification results and promises to have potential for further refinement for increased accuracy as well as application in online brain computer interface (BCI)."
15068187,"Different cognitive tasks were investigated for use with a brain-computer interface (BCI). The main aim was to evaluate which two of several candidate tasks lead to patterns of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity that could be differentiated most reliably and, therefore, produce the highest communication rate. An optimal signal processing method was also sought to enhance differentiation of EEG profiles across tasks. In ten normal subjects (five male), aged 29-54 years, EEG activity was recorded from four channels during cognitive tasks grouped in pairs, and performed alternately. Four imagery tasks were: spatial navigation around a familiar environment; auditory imagery of a familiar tune; and right and left motor imagery of opening and closing the hand. Signal processing methodology included autoregressive (AR) modeling and classification based on logistic regression and a nonlinear generative classifier. The highest communication rate was found using the navigation and auditory imagery tasks. In terms of classification performance and, hence, possible communication rate, these results were significantly better (p < 0.05) than those obtained with the classical pairing of motor tasks involving imaginary movements of the left and right hands. In terms of EEG data analysis, a nonlinear classification model provided more robust results than a linear model (p << 0.01), and a lower AR model order than those used in previous work was found to be effective. These findings have implications for establishing appropriate methods to operate BCI systems, particularly for disabled people who may experience difficulty with motor tasks, even motor imagery."
14677109,"This paper describes a paralyzed patient diagnosed with severe infantile cerebral palsy, trained over a period of several months to use an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) for verbal communication. The patient learned to ""produce"" two distinct EEG patterns by mental imagery and to use this skill for BCI-controlled spelling. The EEG feedback training was conducted at a clinic for Assisted Communications, supervised from a distant laboratory with the help of a telemonitoring system. As a function of training sessions significant learning progress was found, resulting in an average accuracy level of 70% correct responses for letter selection. At present, ""copy spelling"" can be performed with a rate of approximately one letter per minute. The proposed communication device, the ""Virtual Keyboard"", may improve actual levels of communication ability in completely paralyzed patients. ""Telemonitoring-assisted"" training facilitates clinical application in a larger number of patients."
14511455,"The human brain can simulate motor actions without physically executing them, and there is a neuro-psychological relationship between imaging and performing a movement. These are shared opinions. In fact there is scientific evidence showing that the mental simulation of an action is correlated to a subliminal activation of the motor system. There is also evidence that virtual stimulation can enhance the acquisition of simple motor sequences. In some situations, virtual training was found to be as beneficial as real training and more beneficial than workbook and no training in teaching complex motor skills to people with learning disabilities. Moreover, studies of brain-injured hemiplegics patients suggest that these patients retain the ability to generate accurate motor images even of actions that they cannot perform. Combined with evidence indicating that motor imagery and motor planning share common neural mechanisms, these observations suggest that supporting mental imagery through non-immersive, low-cost virtual reality (VR) applications may be a potentially effective intervention in the rehabilitation of brain-injured patients. Starting from this background, our goal is to design and develop a new technique for the acquisition of new motor abilities- ""imagery enhanced learning"" (or I-learning)-to be used in neuro-psychological rehabilitation. A key feature of I-learning is the use of potentially low-cost, Virtual Reality enhanced technology to facilitate motor imagery creating a compelling sense of presence. This paper will discuss the rationale and a preliminary rehabilitation protocol for investigating mental imagery as a means of promoting motor recovery in patients with a neurological disorder. The treatment strategy aims at evoking powerful imaginative responses using an innovative technique which makes no attempt to simulate the real-world motor behavior, but draws the patient's attention to its underlying dynamic structure. This is done by displaying highly stylized sketches of the motor behavior on a computer screen and gradually increasing the perceptual realism of the visualization. This strategy assumes that optimal learning will be achieved when the patient is allowed to elaborate his own schema and sequences of movements, thereby constructing his own personal image of the motor behavior to be trained."
12964454,"The ""Graz Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)"" transforms changes in oscillatory EEG activity into control signals for external devices and feedback. These changes are induced by various motor imageries performed by the user. For this study, 2 different types of motor imagery (movement of the right vs. left hand or both feet) were classified by processing 2 bipolar EEG-channels (derived at electrode positions C3 and C4). After a few sessions, within some weeks, 4 young paraplegic patients learned to control the BCI. In accordance with the participants, decision-speed (trial length) was varied and the information transfer rate (ITR) was calculated for each run. All experimental runs have been feedback-runs employing a simple computer-game-like paradigm. A falling ball had to be led into a randomly marked target halfway down the screen. The horizontal position was controlled by the BCI-output signal and the trial length was varied by the investigator across runs. The goal was to find values for trial length enabling a maximum ITR. Three out of 4 participants had good results after a few runs. Analysis of their last 2 experimental sessions, each containing between 10 and 16 runs, showed that the trial length can be reduced to values around 2 s to obtain the highest possible information transfer. Attainable ITRs were between 5 and 17 bit/min depending on the participant's performance and condition."
12899267,"The Graz-brain-computer interface (BCI) is a cue-based system using the imagery of motor action as the appropriate mental task. Relevant clinical applications of BCI-based systems for control of a virtual keyboard device and operations of a hand orthosis are reported.

12899254,"The opening of a communication channel between brain and computer [brain-computer interface (BCI)] is possible by using changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectra related to the imagination of movements. In this paper, we present results obtained by recording EEG during an upper limb motor imagery task in a total of 18 subjects by using low-resolution surface Laplacian, different linear and quadratic classifiers, as well as a variable number of scalp electrodes, from 2 to 26. The results (variable correct classification rate of mental imagery between 75% and 95%) suggest that it is possible to recognize quite reliably ongoing mental movement imagery for BCI applications."

The present paper reviews research on cognitive tasks and other methods of generating and controlling specific changes in EEG activity that can be used to drive BCI systems. To date, motor imagery has been the most commonly used task. This paper explores the possibility that other cognitive tasks, including those used in imaging studies, may prove to be more effective. Other factors which influence performance are also considered in relation to selection of tasks, as well as training of subjects."
12705420,"This case study describes how a completely paralyzed patient, diagnosed with severe cerebral palsy, was trained over a period of several months to use an electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) for verbal communication. EEG feedback training was performed in the patient's home (clinic), supervised from a distant laboratory with the help of a 'telemonitoring system'. Online feedback computation was based on single-trial analysis and classification of specific band power features of the spontaneous EEG. Task-related changes in brain oscillations over the course of training steps was investigated by quantifying time-frequency maps of event-related (de-)synchronization (ERD/ERS). The patient learned to 'produce' two distinct EEG patterns, beta band ERD during movement imagery vs. no ERD during relaxing, and to use this for BCI-controlled spelling. Significant learning progress was found as a function of training session, resulting in an average accuracy level of 70% (correct responses) for letter selection. 'Copy spelling' was performed with a rate of approximately one letter per min. The proposed BCI training procedure, based on electroencephalogram (EEG) biofeedback and concomitant adaptation of feature extraction and classification, may improve actual levels of communication ability in locked-in patients. 'Telemonitoring-assisted' BCI training facilitates clinical application in a larger number of patients."
11561664,"The information transfer rate, given in bits per trial, is used as an evaluation measurement in a brain-computer interface (BCI). Three subjects performed four motor-imagery (left hand, right hand, foot, and tongue) and one mental-calculation task. Classification of the electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns is based on band power estimates and hidden Markov models (HMMs). We propose a method that combines the EEG patterns based on separability into subsets of two, three, four, and five mental tasks. The information transfer rates of the BCI systems comprised of these subsets are reported. The achieved information transfer rates vary from 0.42 to 0.81 bits per trial and reveal that the upper limit of different mental tasks for a BCI system is three. In each subject, different combinations of three tasks resulted in the best performance."
11482363,"The electroencephalogram (EEG) is modified by motor imagery and can be used by patients with severe motor impairments (e.g., late stage of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) to communicate with their environment. Such a direct connection between the brain and the computer is known as an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI). This paper describes a new type of BCI system that uses rapid prototyping to enable a fast transition of various types of parameter estimation and classification algorithms to real-time implementation and testing. Rapid prototyping is possible by using Matlab, Simulink, and the Real-Time Workshop. It is shown how to automate real-time experiments and perform the interplay between on-line experiments and offline analysis. The system is able to process multiple EEG channels on-line and operates under Windows 95 in real-time on a standard PC without an additional digital signal processor (DSP) board. The BCI can be controlled over the Internet, LAN or modem. This BCI was tested on 3 subjects whose task it was to imagine either left or right hand movement. A classification accuracy between 70% and 95% could be achieved with two EEG channels after some sessions with feedback using an adaptive autoregressive (AAR) model and linear discriminant analysis (LDA)."
11204035,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during right and left motor imagery allow one to establish a new communication channel for, e.g., patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Such an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) can be used to develop a simple binary response for the control of a device. Three subjects participated in a series of on-line sessions to test if it is possible to use common spatial patterns to analyze EEG in real time in order to give feedback to the subjects. Furthermore, the classification accuracy that can be achieved after only three days of training was investigated. The patterns are estimated from a set of multichannel EEG data by the method of common spatial patterns and reflect the specific activation of cortical areas. By construction, common spatial patterns weight each electrode according to its importance to the discrimination task and suppress noise in individual channels by using correlations between neighboring electrodes. Experiments with three subjects resulted in an error rate of 2, 6 and 14% during on-line discrimination of left- and right-hand motor imagery after three days of training and make common spatial patterns a promising method for an EEG-based brain-computer interface."
10896191,We present an overview of our research into brain-computer interfacing (BCI).

10478710,"EEG feedback studies demonstrate that human subjects can learn to regulate electrocortical activity over the sensorimotor cortex. Such self-induced EEG changes could serve as control signals for a Brain Computer Interface. The experimental task of the current study was to imagine either right-hand or left-hand movement depending on a visual cue stimulus on a computer monitor. The performance of this imagination task was controlled on-line by means of a feedback bar that represented the current EEG pattern. EEG signals recorded from left and right central recording sites were used for on-line classification. For the estimation of EEG parameters, an adaptive autoregressive model was applied, and a linear discriminant classifier was used to discriminate between EEG patterns associated with left and right motor imagery. Four trained subjects reached 85% to 95% classification accuracy in the course of the experimental sessions. To investigate the impact of continuous feedback presentation, time courses of band power changes were computed for subject-specific frequency bands. The EEG data revealed a significant event-related desynchronization over the contralateral central area in all subjects. Two subjects simultaneously displayed synchronization of EEG activity (event-related synchronization) over the ipsilateral side. During feedback presentation the event-related desynchronization/event-related synchronization patterns showed increased hemispheric asymmetry compared to initial control sessions without feedback."

The EEG signals were analyzed in subject-specific frequency bands and classified on-line by a neural network. The network output was used as a feedback signal. The on-line error (100%-perfect classification) was between 10.0 and 38.1%. In addition, the single-trial data were also analyzed off-line by using an adaptive autoregressive (AAR) model of order 6. With a linear discriminant analysis the estimated parameters for left and right motor imagery were separated. The error rate obtained varied between 5.8 and 32.8% and was, on average, better than the on-line results. By using the AAR-model for on-line classification an improvement in the error rate can be expected, however, with a classification delay around 1 s."
